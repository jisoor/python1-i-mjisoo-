   WHY HE IS FE DOMINANT  He judges the external world entirely through the lens of his values  blatantly F dominant  His acceptance of Nezuko for example  revolves around her living up to rengoku s ideal of a good and just person  as well as what makes a demon slayer a demon slayer  This isnt based on any logical conclusion  rather it s because she did what he considered the  right  thing   Inside the train  I saw that girl protect humans despite her bleeding out  Those who risk their lives to protect humans are demon hunters  no matter what anyone else tries to say    When rejecting Akaza s offer to become a demon he didn t cite any logical justification  rather he straight up says and I quote  You and I have different moral values  No matter what kind of motivation I may have  I will not become a demon   His dominant decision maker is his values  not logic   And when akaza first met him  as a response to akaza saying some random crap about weakness  rengoku s response  once again  was about his values and akazas differing from eachother  nothing about akaza being illogical   He tells his brother to follow the path that his heart dictates  not to follow the most logical route  not to follow tradition  rather to follow what HE desires and what HE values  Once again  focused on values  NOT logic   People seem to have some misconceptions about feeling functions on this website  His strong unwavering morals do not mean he is a Fi user  It just means he is high in either feeling function  The way you differentiate is in the EXTROVERSION VS INTROVERSION  In the manga anime movie he is quite obviously focused externally with his values and very straight forward objective with them  There is not a desire for depth in his values  rather he wants to mold the external world around them  This is some extreme Fe      WHY HIS ENNEAGRAM   DOESN T EXPLAIN HIS STRONG VALUES ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE AN ENTJ  Sorry chief but it s pretty obvious  The reason him potentially being an ENTJ   doesnt explain his strong values is because he very clearly doesn t show any simultaneous focus on universal logic like high Te  s do  He blatantly expresses high Fe  not high Te  in my previous section   I show his lack of a primary logical focus  If he were an ENTJ    he d well  actually show Te LOL  and he also shows no Fi      WHY I THINK HE IS Ni Se  Simply put  there is no desire to digest and deconstruct sensory data and experiences  There s never really any riveting and nuanced sensory observations with rengoku  hes really objective about that kind of stuff    Specifically an instance I find perfect to cite for his intuition and sensory thinking is when he is fighting akaza and thinks   The attacks reach me when he fires into the empty air with his fists  he s moving at a fraction of a blink  If he fights me from a distance like he is now  It ll be dangerous for me to cut his head off  In that case  I ll get in close     The first sentence shows him taking the ongoing fight as is and not really delving into his sensory observations like si users would  The next sentence shows him using an abstract idea prediction  that if the fight continues as is he ll lose  to narrow down and come to the conclusion that he should get in close  Instead of expanding upon his more abstract thinking and prediction like Ne would  he narrows it down and concludes with it  This is like the singular good example of him using perceiving functions and it indicates Ni Se ,enfj
N o estou entendendo esse tanto de voto ENTJ  o cara   claramente Fe dominante,enfj
Rengoku de ENTJ   Sangu neo Col rico kkkkk esse site   uma piada as vezes  esse absurdo   maior que Inosuke ESTP  Rengoku nem tem oq argumentar  ele claramente pensa no coletivo  ele coloca todos a frente dele  ele n o   do tipo que faz oq for preciso por puro ego smo ou pra conseguir algo que quer  nem nada pelo bem pr prio  ele pensa no bem pelos outros  ele   muito parecido com Tanjiro que tamb m   ENFJ  at  eu que n o entendo perfeitamente de mbti  vejo isso  Sem falar que ele   claramente sangu neo dominante  n o tem NADA col rico no Rengoku kkkk ctz q os argumentos dele ser col rico   pq sentiu raiva do akaza      eu s  imagino isso kkkk sangu neo dominante n sente raiva n   ate Tanjiro que   sangu neo fleum tico sente raiva as vezes kkkk nd a ver,enfj
Guys he is an ENTJ trust me  he s just a youngster with a massive inferior function it makes total sense ,enfj
can someone please explain to me how Te is his dominant function  I don t feel really convinced by the ENTJ arguments that i saw  his Fi doesn t look like inferior Fi to me  I also didn t really notice his Te in the first place   If you guys don t mind I would really appreciate it if some of you gave me examples of his Te    In my opinion  Not going against his values doesn t necessary means that it s Fi  and i think anyone in his place would have done the same as he did  following the values his mother taught him before she died  or at least that is what i would have done being put on his shoes  This might also be seen as a sign of loyalty rather than healthy Te Fi  I believe that his dominant function is Fe rather than Te for obvious reasons  but I m still not sure of his Ti   I really hope that this made sense to you guys  sorry if anyone thinks this is wrong  I just wanted to share my opinion here for the first time  Also I m open to change my opinion anytime   ,enfj
Just finished the movie    he s probably Fe dom   ,enfj
I m genuinely a bit confused on his type  I see him as Fi Te   Fe Ti  but he definitely doesn t strike me as someone with inferior feeling  Either way  I m probably going to reread the manga before casting my vote ,enfj
no wonder why i love him so much,enfj
im not too concerned with the enxj arguments  although I will say that the way his morality is shown in the show is very external  it s not internal and he thinks of others all the time  it s never what he wants or believes first  Thats a big indicator of fe and not inferior fi  I think when ENFJs show their  logical side  or whatever  they can look like ENTJs esp since fe can look like te too  but what i am concerned about is how he was possibly the best character in this show   Im still not over his death i that speech at the end bruh   i miss this mans,enfj
Honestly a lot of people on this site do not understand the functions  I m glad Rengoku is getting the right votes  Rengoku talks about pushing feelings down and focusing straight on the objective  compared to Tanjiro  who counts everyone s feelings as valid and uses them actively in his judgement process    Also  He wanted to kill Tanjiro and Nezuko  is in no way a good arguement for Te  ANY TYPE IS CAPABLE OF KILLING PEOPLE  EDIT  I have decided that he is ENFJ  if you re wondering why  look at the fourth comment in the replies ,enfj
can someone explain EIE instead of SEE Fi  Where s the creative Ni ,enfj
Is there any arguments about why he is EIE   I m new to socionics  thanks in advance,enfj
I think the ESFP voted may be due to him being skilled in choreography and his impulsive behavior   However  I slightly don t think that makes him ESFP  He does give off some Se  since I can agree he could be active throughout his   senses  Yes  he s a little impulsive but that s mostly because of his Se Tertiary  Your Tertiary function should anyway be developed when you re at least     I think    I also don t see the ESFP  because of how he doesn t show much Fi  I don t think he really follows a moral code or uses his beliefs to understand the world around him    His Fe Dominant is very obvious to me  Jimin is definitely the type to value and have an interest for social harmony and is very affectionate for others  Shows also affection towards his fan A LOT  Rather than expressing his feelings  I notice how he rather shows them  than being emotionally expressive  His main focus is also the fans very much  as he mentions them the most in interviews    I think he does show some Ni  as his thinking seems kinda future oriented as well     EDIT   Let s talk about his Enneagram now    I think there are  w  votes due to the fact he s really nice and generous   However   Meh  I agree w  those traits  but nah he s not a   core    Jimin is highly success oriented and is always looking forward to success  from what I remember in interviews  These are something  s desire    I think if a few of the  w  voters learn Instinctual Variants  that would be great  because Sx so  w  can kinda look like Type   in Enneagram tbh   Especially when healthy    w  allows him to want others to admire him  which I can definitely see  but his desire is not to mainly be loved or admired  though I see this  It s not something he fears  and he s very success oriented    His Tritype Extended     w     w     w    The  w  seems kinda obvious lol  He s pretty enthusiastic and playful  from how I have seen him  He also tends to want to be the center of attention of a group  from what I can kinda recall before  which kinda stands out in the Sx so  w  ,enfj
Ok  but why  w  instead of  w   Jimin is a very perfectionist person  getting angry with himself when he isn t perfect  And the other members say he had a lot of internalized anger when he was younger  I hope someone can explain  Thanks ,enfj
Sexual   s very emotional and caring  unlike social   that s why he seems   core but he is not  Learn instinctual variant guys  ,enfj
can someone please explain the   to me ,enfj
Could someone explain to me why he is     instead of      ,enfj
Why not SLOAI  Also  I do agree that he s ENFJ  but were there ever any actual arguments for ESFP because I would like to hear them    ,enfj
I mean i believe he s the most type   person I know  Filter as a song says a lot   in a very unhealthy way   about the tendency  s have to offer themselves to shield the people they love,enfj
Our typology matches a lot  That s interesting ,enfj
ENTP  Ne Ti Fe Si  Ne  Hates boredom and routine  even in old age  This motivated him and his friends to brainstorm and organize the games  Il nam sees a problem  he tries to come up with a creative solution to said problem  He can come up to innovative solutions based on his imagination and experience  as proven by Tug of war competition when he came up with his old tactics  Il nam enjoys gambling  to the point at the end of his life he willingly participated in his own death games    Ti  Is good at figuring things and logical flaws out  When Gi hun asks him what is he doing in the games while his daughter in law should be cooking for him  he asked Gi hun whether his mother also gets dinner from her daughter in law  During the marbles game  he also pointed out that Gi hun shouldn t see all in gambling as unfair as he got all his marbles by abusing old man s  faked  dementia   Fe  Il Nam can read people  especially Gi hun  like a book  He is also open with his emotions  often telling people how they make him feel  However  his morality is obviously poorly developed  blindspot Fi   The only reasons Il nam sees the games as justified is that the players agreed to participate  they probably have higher chance in suceeding than in capitalism  plus humanity as a whole is insensitive    Si  Il nam is a very nostalgic man  He created the games to remind him of his childhood and decided to participate to relive his childhood memories  He often mentions his son and wife and it is implied he might have lost touch with them and regrets it    I disagree with ENFJ because he is clearly a Ne Si axis user  I disagree with ESFJ because he doesn t show any inferior Te  plus he seems to despise routine too much to be an auxiliary Si user ,enfj
Si   Introverted sensors have a vast memory bank of stored impressions  facts  and details that give them unshakeable ideas and viewpoints  Si dominant personality types can easily recall details and experiences from the past and then they use this information in combination with their judging process  They consider what they ve learned  from mistakes  from memory  from their education  and they take all that accumulated knowledge and apply it to their decisions   Introverted intuition have advanced insight and awareness of patterns and underlying meanings  They can quickly understand complex or abstract concepts  but may have a harder time remembering concrete  sensory details   what is something he did all the time   Where the Introverted Sensor focuses on what  is  the Introverted Intuitive focuses on what lies  behind the curtain   This is why Si users are more likely to take things at face value  whereas Ni users are more likely to read between the lines  Exceptions to this occur when Si users have a reason related to the past where they may need to distrust something someone is saying  example   This person has lied to me before  so I need to read more deeply into what this person is saying now     Introverted Intuitives focus much more on the future than Introverted Sensors do  Ni dominant types are always looking ahead  trying to determine what will be  They do far less comparing and contrasting with past experiences  and are less fond of  tried and true  techniques  They are less interested in authority  credentials  and past experience  and are more interested in finding a new pathway or manner of doing something    Sensors look at what is   Intuition looks at what could be ,enfj
regardless of type  he definitely uses fe  he is one hundred percent an sp          and an eie in socionics,enfj
I think he s kinda hard to type because we ll never get to actually see what he acts like outside of his helpless old man act but we can make a guess based on his decision making and thought process  I think he would be an Ni user rather than Ne dom because he doesn t seem to act on or really think of what could be possible and relies on methods hes already familiar with  for example what he did during tug of war  If anyone has an argument for Ne id like to hear but i don t think he would be one facade or not ,enfj
ENTP arguments make no sense  gripes only happen under stress  depression ecc   or end within a time frame  he has been using Fe   Si Ne  Fe Ni Se  all the time and with peace of mind  Perhaps you should re read the part where Carl Jung when he explains  The inferior function is practically identical with the dark side of the human personality ,enfj
He dialed up the tertiary Fe  He s an ENTP with a ESFJ mask  Ne Fe so he can pull it off well   Reminds me of Michael from The Good Place    The devil that wants to play in his own game ,enfj
I thought SLI before the last episode  but after the last episode I d say ILE is a slam dunk  The dude was just bored and looking for something new to do  He started a bunch of death games out of boredom with a sociopathic sort of disregard for the individuals involved  For him  people were mere playthings  and while we don t learn why his family abandoned him  it would seem that either his pursuit of riches or something else pushed them away  It was at the end of his life specifically when he decided that he wanted to experience a sense of comfortable childlike joy  Not to mention his very cynical outlook on life used to logically justify his immoral actions   Overall I see a while lot of Ne  PoLR Fi is obvious  Ti used as justification  with a transition to a  admittedly twisted  desire for Fe Si at the end of his life ,enfj
What social instinct is doing at the second place on his stack  He doesn t acts against the gluttony  an characteristic of social Seven  Social  s are generous and have a strong desire to be of service  to create a better world  Sacrificing their own needs to serve the needs of a group or person they support  They can be judgemental regarding selfishness in themselves or others  Oh Il nam embraces the gluttony  becoming self interested and pleasure seeking at the extreme  just like a self preservation  He also have sx   characteristics  but they are t strong as the sp   ones ,enfj
ENFPs  dont step on me pls  but step next to me and i ll follow,enfj
How can ISFP be one of the least voted on this thread   https   www idrlabs com ISFP php Just rolling this page without paying too much attention  I saw two sex symbols  Marilyn Monroe and Brad Pitt ,enfj
They are what comes to mind when I hear the word  though of course all types have their qualities,enfj
why be attractive when you can be a dumbass,enfj
i match everything here  that i know of     anyway also voting for myself,enfj
ISTP and ENxP s are the most attractive persons to me         but if we vote on a general statement  tbfh  ESxP and ExxJ s are said to be most attractive,enfj
I m curious  Are we voting what we find most attractive or what we suspect the general public would find most attractive   I assumed the latter  though I also tend to find ESFJs attractive  ,enfj
I put myself just cause  but i find INFPs and INTJs so attractive  INTJs cuz I understand them a lot  and INFPs are really cute  but I like INTJs more  ISTJs are also cute   I like them a lot  but they get on my nerves sometimes ,enfj
ISTJ women can step all over me   ,enfj
ive got a thing for them tbh,enfj
me  take it or leave it    ,enfj
im wishing to be like my father one day but    yeah ,enfj
 s please teach me how to be happy  Sincerely   w ,enfj
ok  they ARE SO COOL,enfj
I do not need to say anything else,enfj
them  just them ,enfj
OMG THATS ME,enfj
I don t even need to say you guys are so awesome,enfj
people that are true to themselves are so hot to me omg,enfj
Is there a way to vote for every type O,enfj
Can someone explain Fe to me outside of her desire for union  That has much more to do with her being  w   It s a goal  not a cognitive process ,enfj
honestly i don t see type   at all  i think she s probably a  w  or maybe a  ,enfj
i m almost done season one and i m having a hard time seeing ni aux  i may of misread the conversation but didn t light hope straight up say she needs to focus more on the big picture  so far it seems like her storyline is to help tap into lower ni more than aux  again i m only on season one ,enfj
she s not an ENTJ  she s not just  helping people  she made her entire purpose in her life being a tool for the greater good  her fe is so obvious when she easily forgave catra ,enfj
People really don t even consider Te dom for her  huh  There is this stereotype that Te users are uber confident and don t feel insecurities  just like the stereotype that only introverts can feel social anxiety ,enfj
As I think about it  why does people think she has strong fe than se or ti  Her failure of understanding catra feelings  her lack of ability to handle emotional situations and her awkwardness with them  her inability to understand social implications of her actions such as in frosta ball  Infact if you compare her fe to bow  you will realize how bad she is  Yeah she is a people pleaser but I think it is more se fe rather fe se,enfj
I think she s an ESTP  not an ENFJ  She seems to seriously lack Ni and have stronger Se than Fe imo  her Fe s very strong  I just think it pales in comparison to her Se multiple times throughout the series      Trying to sneak into Shadowweaver s room and repeatedly getting caught by Glimmer and Bow  Se over Ni    Blindly trusting and getting betrayed by Huntara  big Se  strong enough Fe to socialize but not strong enough to read the signs  no Ni    Impulsively asking a tavern of killers in the Crimson Waste for help  Huge Se  some Fe considering she was polite enough not to get whacked    Making a mess of the Princess Ball when calling Frosta a kid   going buckwild while chasing Catra  Se over both Ni and Fe    Her general approach to chasing down Catra is all action  no planning and she states this openly  Se over Ni  Ti for the analysis of the princesses  attack patterns    Blind to being manipulated by the Horde  Lack of Fe Ni    Horrible interrogation of Shadowweaver lmao Miss  In order to catch the spy  we need you to admit that you re the spy   Lack of Fe Ni   Se for impulsivity   Edit  Here s another   Blindly trusting the Horde in episode   and only realizing they were evil after seeing the bots  damage for herself  Se with no Ni  Se accepts what it comes across in its immediate environment whereas Ni looks for deeper meaning  ,enfj
i m sorry i m new to socionics  but i don t understand how she s ESI over EII     aren t ESI s openly expressive of anger and negative emotions  socio Se is aggressive  that doesn t seem like her at all   shes most certainly socio Fi  but Se polar  or however you say it  seems a lot more likely    if i m wrong please feel free to correct me   also she doesnt have a sexual   bone in her body ,enfj
She is so stuck on achieving her goal that it takes an Fi aux to make her realize she has no idea what her personal feelings are  I seriously dare anyone to give me a better example of inf  Fi in media than that ,enfj
Where s the auxiliary intuition  He shows more Si IMO  Unlike endeavour  he cares more about  doing the right thing    Intuition  especially NI  is more about  creating the right thing   He isn t reformist and his training of deku in the early seasons showed lack of intuition    ESFJs tend to be matter of fact and practical  conventional  copiously and factually conversational  In a      study by Harold Grant  ESFJs were the one type that chose  an opportunity to be of service to others  as the most important feature of an ideal job ,enfj
Why isn t he a type    Wasn t he always concerned with what was best for humanity thus he faked the whole symbol of peace for the sake of others  he appeared that way to put people at ease ,enfj
Tamaki Suoh from Ouran High School Host Club is an ENFJ  w  so sx  He gets upset at others for not giving him the consideration and affection he feels he deserves  He says things like   Why doesn t my precious Haruhi pay any attention to me    All Might is an ENFJ  w  so sx  He gets upset at himself for not performing to his own standards  He says things like   You re right  As his teacher I should have reprimanded him for coming here  I ve failed  which is why I have to make it up to him  ,enfj
He may seem like an ESTP but i agree  ENFJ  He puts on a good face to enable his Fe to save others as often as he can  He really cares deep down about helping others before himself  which just screams ENFJ ,enfj
Looked over the comments and couldn t find a good argument for Ni at all  Not sure why everyone thinks All Might is an intuitive   https   www personalitycafe com threads social nines according to beatrice chestnut           Social Nines express the passion of psychological laziness  or sloth  through merging with the group  working hard in support of group interests  and prioritizing the group s needs above their own  Social Nines are congenial characters with a need to feel like they re a part of things    a need that expresses an underlying feeling of being different or not fitting in with the group or community  This person is a light hearted  sociable  fun loving character who expresses a driving need to be involved in the group     Social Nines have a passion for doing what is necessary to pay the ticket for group admission  for being one with that group    but it takes a lot of effort  Social Nines can be workaholics  they feel a need to work hard and give a lot  But it s not just work they energetically demonstrate friendliness and sociability  they don t show their pain  they don t burden others  and they don t show people how much energy it takes to devote so much effort to the community  These are people who are generous and unselfish  mindful of the group  and gifted in meeting the needs of others to the point where they sacrifice themselves to satisfy the responsibility others want to put on them     In contrast to the other two Nine Subtypes  who tend to be more subdued characters  Social Nines are very outgoing and energetic    this is what makes this the counter type Nine  Social Nines have a special brand of strength because they feel motivated to fight for the needs of the group  Social Nines are extroverted  expressive  and forceful  and so they go against the inertia typical of Type Nine in some ways    but on the inside they still have a sense of laziness about their own needs and wants     Social Nines make very good leaders  the best kind of leaders  in fact  in the sense that they are good  unselfish people who strive to satisfy the responsibility given them  They can be especially gifted mediators  they naturally want to translate differing opinions so that everyone is heard and conflict in the group is avoided  They put a lot of energy into their work as a leader  They have an ability to bear a lot  sometimes to the extent that they become a  human punching bag   These Nines give of themselves unconditionally as a response to a deeper  sometimes unconscious  fear of abandonment  conflict  separation  and the potential loss of peace and harmony        Because they work so hard for the group  they may have no time left for themselves  They tend to have very full lives    full of everything but themselves  And while Social Nines get their identity and their sense of reality form belonging  they often doubt their own existence  their own sense of self     The outward expression of this subtype is more happy than sad  but theirs may ultimately be a kind of partial participation  underneath their cheerful exterior  their sense of not belonging persists and creates a kind of sadness that isn t communicated to others  They don t feel their suffering very much    but they don t feel extreme  euphoric highs  either  They are more in the middle emotionally  neither hot nor cold  and they may be somewhat detached from their emotions and sensations     Social Nines can look like Type Threes because they work very hard and accomplish a lot without showing the stress of it  But they differ from Threes in that they are much more reluctant to be in the spotlight and they don t support the group to create an image or to win admiration from others  They may also be mistaken for Twos because they are active in meeting the needs of others  but they have much less need for approval and appreciation than Twos  and are generally more emotionally steady    All Might obviously isn t very reluctant to be in the spotlight  but his need for an image didn t stem from deception  it was to ensure that the peace was maintained and that people wouldn t lose hope  nor that villains wouldn t see it as an opportunity to act  It was practical  and trying to predict exactly what is happening right now in the manga  not because he wanted a good image specifically    He s also not a    The helper of the Enneagram isn t    it s    Claudio Naranjo has explicitly pointed out this misconception    Since my statement in the early   s that E  people were  Jewish mothers   it has become widespread opinion that they are  most characteristically   helpers   This is misleading  for the role of helper is even more characteristic of E   In this highly emotional and romantic E  character   help  translates as  emotional support   and on the whole  the personality is better evoked through  lover  than  helper     Transformation Through Insight        by Claudio Naranjo,enfj
it s kinda funny to me the existence of   core voters  i feel like every possible argument to All Might   core can be easily explainable by Heart core issues  in general    being very goal oriented    like Threes  All Might is very image conscious and indeed likes to appear the best  the  top   Hero  is a place of worship to him  he told Deku to make himself  present  in the Tournament Arc  even if he had to leave others behind  like Todoroki s problems  this whole arc made it seem like All Might was a    i agree  but overall that s not true   let s make it clear that All Might s demeanor in this particular case aligned to    even though the motivation was still Type   leaning  he didn t want Deku to succeed in the tournament because success would be the only thing that would make him  complete   realize that the reason was still for Deku to comfort the audience s heart by stating   you have a new Symbol of Peace growing up  everything will be fine   now going for Enneatypes Passions    Type    Pride  Pride consists of an inability or unwillingness to acknowledge one s own suffering  While seeking to  help  others   Type Two denies many of his own needs  This passion could also be described as  vainglory    pride in one s prowess   i mean  notice how almost all problems that All Might faces during the anime are thanks to him seeking to protect everyone at the cost of his own body and well being   him not wanting his frail body to be exposed is also    as an image type  All Might is very aware of what the public s  and the villains   response would be if it were discovered that he s no longer what he once was  and as a    his goal is to preserve positive emotions  to see a smile on every citizen s face  the reason All Might almost failed to defeat Nomu in S  was because he was neglectful of his own needs and ended up spending more of his energy saving civilians in overtime   this scene has an extreme symbolic value  he didn t spare himself to win the battle even for a single stuck hostage  he once again denied his own needs for others  it s widely recognized in modern psychology that we often get angry at others when we see in them something we hate about ourselves  by projection  what made All Might most angry at Midoriya during the anime was his neglect on his body and needs  he thought Midoriya wouldn t be able to succeed in the tournament because of this  take a look at this scene   take note Gran Torino often refers to Midoriya as Toshinori      and Midoriya s also   heart   applying the same notion i mentioned above  something that made him angry towards All For One was that he s manipulative and toys with people  well  not saying All Might is manipulative  although he is  in some ways   but notice how what we re inclined to perceive equals what we also struggle with  Type   is the most manipulative type of the whole Enneagram  i d have a hard time seeing All Might s passion being  illusion   his whole journey is purely Type     Mo daijoubu  Naze tte  Watashi ga kita   his classic quote and  s obsession over positive emotions ,enfj
I think Toshinori and All Might have different personalities  but I might just be paranoid ,enfj
Tbh some dude in the comment section really did make a point all might does not fear being unloved but I also like to make an argument he doesn t really have the core desire or fear of a three either which begs the question what is his core fear or motivation to me his motivation is to uphold an ideal which is to become the symbol of peace but not for the sake of getting approval or fame but for the sake of protecting and reassuring people,enfj
Lol oh man i hate going against the majority but i just don t see Ti inferior  but rather Se inferior and even Te PoLR in just the first episode alone  Gonna have to go with INFJ for now ,enfj
The so   Ambassador  ambition   Self esteem is earned by getting social approval in the group  being recognized as special  being indispensable to the right people  Public image is what counts  but often content to be the power behind the scenes  Welcome compliments  find it very hard to tolerate feeling they are being taken for granted   The so    Politician  prestige   High profile public image   social status brings recognition   the sense of  being somebody   Like to play a public role  take the lead in social groups  look the part they re playing  Want to be the leader  not help the leader  unlike  s   Dislike being upstaged  are secretly hurt by it but don t let on   I think he s more of a   than a   in this case  in terms of what he aims for in his career  and his struggles after his retirement  and even between him and Sir Nighteye earlier   He needs to be needed by others  and there are moments that will be animated where this sort of mindset gets reconciled    Some mild manga reveals   For example  when Deku came back from his internship and shows his skills  All Might thinks as Deku charges forward with his back to him   You don t look back at me anymore    And his chat with Aizawa about his choice to live on seems to be hinging on this too   And a major manga reveal recently   All Might looking out for Deku while they re on the hunt for AFO  and making lunches for him  and when Deku eventually decides to reject his help and assistance  and the lunch   it absolutely destroys him broken from that fear of not being needed anymore   From  On The Nature of the Enneagram Subtypes  by Susan Rhodes ,enfj

joy has always struck me as an ESFP  sure  there are instances of her planning but she seems to lean toward the p side,enfj
ESE  I don t think she s one bit of the alpha group that treats people as they come and has an established intimacy relationship  To me it is clearly BETA or rather an EIE that observes a group and group priority relationship versus that  It does not have the constructive emotionality of the ESE  it has the potential to observe the lack of LES   I also think she is much more negative  always focused on lack and comparison  When I excluded the sadness because in her view  there is no room for the sadness  because unconsciously it was a way for her to lose her power   I don t see her as sx sx either  she is much more sx s potential and intense that she seeks a path as more important and stronger than she is  A   would only easily hear and make room for the others  as it shares your gluttony  In the case of Alegria  gluttony was enhanced as a source of what she considered gluttony  it was beautiful to see all the channels and everything working  When she got close she saw how different it really was from the  sx she dreamed of  I don t see her as a real villain  but she would be an anti hero,enfj
Nah I don t see the    social  s get mistyped as  s all the time anyway   This countertype acts against the gluttony that characterises the Seven  tending to mistype with Enneagram    They are generous and have a strong desire to be of service  to create a better world  They will sacrifice their own needs to serve the needs of a group or person they support  They can be judgemental regarding selfishness in themselves or others and they hope to be appreciated for their sacrifice ,enfj
This debate is really interesting tbh  I haven t watched the movie for so long but I ll analyse some quotes I found and see what I can make of the functions    Anger  unload the daydreams  I ve ordered extra incase things get slow in class   Looks more Ni to me  Preparing for a possible future unwravelling      Do you ever look at someone and wonder  what is going on inside their head   This is more of a stereotype for me but I see ENFJs as more curious about how other people s psychology works than an ESFJ would  Also  ESFJs are Ni blind and I struggle to see many ESFJs really dive into this kind of thing  Ni typically likes to solve this kind of problem more often      You remember how she used to stick her tongue out when she was colouring  I could listen to her stories  all day  I just wanted Riley to be happy     OK this sounds like more of an Si thing  whereas ENFJs are blind with Si and recalling memories  though of course not all ENFJS are inherently bad at memory recall  However  I see ENFJs  or people with bad memory in general  like me lol  would be more likely to remember past memories that they really vibed with  and ENFJs tend to love other people recalling stories  This is why ENFJs and INFPs are said to be such a good match  Also  Riley sticking her tongue out suggests she was really enjoying herself and being happy  which is what any Fe dom desires the most  Finally  this might not be a valid argument but Joy doesn t recall small details of the memory  but then again she might not have felt the need to  Honestly this quote could work for either argument  but it s not a clear ESFJ win     Oh  it s that time in the twisty tree  remember  The hockey team showed up and Mom and Dad were there cheering  Look at her  having fun and laughing  It s my favorite    Same arguments for the last memory recall quote I just analysed  Again  it s not too focused on the details      Dad    Trying to feed Riley broccoli  Here we go  All right  open   Joy   Hmm    this looks new    So we know Si tends to be less comfortable with change  I d have to actually watch this scene to look at her tone of voice and body language etc but this doesn t show she s too stressed out by it so I lean more towards ENFJ for this one      Hey  look  The Golden Gate Bridge  Isn t that great  It s not made out of solid gold like we thought  which is kind of a disappointment  but still    Possible Se child again  She also shows disappointment of her idea of it being made of gold as Ni  but she remains optimistic about it  and also once again shows she s better at handling change than an Si user probably would  Also  ENFJs tend to expect or see things quite literally  but I m not sure how that would compare to the ESFJ perspective      Joy and Bing Bong have fallen into the Memory Dump and are stuck down there  doomed to be forgotten forever  Joy tried fruitlessly to climb up the piles of old memories to get out    This could be a more weaker argument for a weak Ne and just attempting a single obvious solution  using Se  The rest of the scene sounds like Joy is going a bit into her INFP shadow  remeniscing of the good moments of the past  It s what an ENFJ would do when they struggle to use several of their usual conscious functions  I d say an ESFJ with child Ne would be able to come up with other ideas of getting out  It s really interesting to read this quote in particular because I see myself getting kinda addicted to sad memories when I am sad sometimes  I m not sure why that happens lol       Joy makes Riley laugh for the first time    Joy    voiceover  It was amazing  Just Riley and me  forever    Riley suddenly starts crying    Joy    voiceover  Um  for thirty three seconds    This could be an argument for Si actually  Not sure how else she would remember the exact number of seconds      Joy begins the new day by waking up all the emotions with an accordion    Super stereotyping but this sounds like an argument against Si  loosely speaking     Joy   Okay  first day of school  Very  very exciting  I was up late last night figuring out a new plan  Here it is    Fear walks by writing on a notepad    Joy   Fear  I need a list of all the possible negative outcomes on the first day at a new school   Again  she s excited by new  I think Si would be a lot more cautious or nervous about it  Also  she s future planning which is another Ni argument  She s asking someone else  Fear  to basically use his Ne  icr where his Ne is tho  because her Ne isn t as strong      Disgust   Hey  guys  What s pub er ty   Joy   I don t know  It s probably not important    Not sure what this could be an argument for  All I know is I myself sometimes dismiss something as probably not important  Could be an inferior Ti thing and go either way for both types    More quotes in comments   ,enfj
ngl I think Joy was the real villain of Inside Out  She meant well  but she was so focused on making Riley happy again she didn t think care about anyone or anything else  I mean she would ve fricking left Sadness if she hadn t fall in the pit of lost memories or something ,enfj
How can she be Si  blind when she s focused on things staying the way they are at first  She changed in that after she saw that it is for the best and it being a part of growing up  but at first she wanted to go back on how the things where  Fe Si  Also some where people are where confusing her with ENFP because she got some Ne  in her  curiosity  looking for diffrent options  ways and possibilties to   It makes her a really happy character  my fav of the emotions ,enfj
When it comes to her being resistant to change  it is because she is resistant to change she hasn t planned for in her mind    Also kind of wishing people would explain why they would hate her instead of saying so without elaboration  Joy  and Sadness  needs to be in the control room for Riley to be on her best path  and it makes sense why Joy is so persistent to be there  Edit  Fe has been explained  Si could be her concerning wanting for her to keep the status quo of dominance  but so does Ni  and she wants to tell others of how she wants the day to be controlled ,enfj
people  her being ordered and resistant to change does not make her ESFJ  she is totally future oriented  she s always worried about what s coming  what s going to happen and what she s going to do  she makes plans and thinks about everything  if that s not Ni I don t know what it is,enfj
anyone wanna tell me where she exhibits wing   traits over wing   traits  i can t recall her ever doing anything for others out of the need to be praised or to have a good reputation  kaede helps people because she believes its right to do so  thats just where her morals align   w s basic desire is to solve problems and accomplish goals to better the lives of others  while  w s desire is to be loved by everyone as a result of their kind actions  soooo     w  arguments ,enfj
in no capacity is she a      she is absolutely a social   and all of you need to figure out what the enneagram means before you vote lmfao,enfj
I finished the first trial and her dominant fe is painfully obvious since all her decisions were for the sake of others and never herself I loved her character and chapter one has me emotional,enfj
I understand why she is Fe dom  but why Ni Se  it s not like i doubted more i want to know  and also why w  ,enfj
i just finished trial one and honestly im too sad to even capitalize letters  her fe is just so strong  her entire motive was to end the killing game and save everyone  she never truly cared for her own safety at any time  it was all for her classmates she saw as friends  she was the first to unite everyone when nobody else would  god dammit im         crying buckets  especially when she appeared next to shuichi it just broke me  pls i need a hug,enfj
She s so Fe dom  the most Fe dom character I ve ever seen in my life She cares A LOT about others and doesn t even care about herself  the plan to try to get the mastermind was literally to save everyone  she was so focused on saving everyone  she did everything to save everyone to the point of sacrificing herself for others  she died trying to protect everyone    She went so far just to save everyone  to make it even easier  her motivation for playing the piano is to see everyone smile  she wants to see people happy and smiling  she wanted to end this game of death to save everyone  she literally sacrificed herself  is there anyone more Fe dom than her   ,enfj
  major spoilers    why wing    she never shows signs of needing praise or admiration from others  if anything  she matches wing   much better    biggest example   she refused to reap the benefits of the First Blood Perk because she didn t believe it was right  she didn t want to escape by herself and leave behind the message that she was abandoning the friends she promised to save  instead  by her own moral compass  she decided she wanted to sacrifice herself so she could fulfill her initial intentions  kaede s very loyal to her morals  even losing her own life to it  with the combination of wanting to be helpful to her friends of course  hence  w    type   is described as  morally heroic   and i feel like that wing fits kaede perfectly ,enfj
It is sooooo satisfying to see a perfectly typed character   Except I can t help but wonder  could somebody explain the Sanguine Choleric votes ,enfj
Seriously tell me this    what other type would she be ,enfj
please don t kill me  but have we considered ENTP with high Fe  i just don t see the ni,enfj
what i don t understand is how did people get mad at him for wearing a dress when brad pitt wore a dress for rolling stone around the same time fight club was released,enfj
He s not a Fe dom  Fe doms would more likely stick to the usual norm  which isn t the case for my harry ,enfj
Looking at the contrast between Harry  and Vin Diesel and Taylor Swift  Even without this contrast  Its clear as crystal to me he seems more Fi dom than Fe  So my vote is ISFP  since ISFP is the Fi version of the ENFJ  Both have a Se Ni axis ,enfj
I went to his concert recently and oh my god I love him so much,enfj
He s def a ENFJ  as a harry stan  you just have to see his kind of humor  how he acts in interviews and specially in concerts  Fe dom for sure  Se makes no sense,enfj
I think it s important to note that it s not always accurate to analyze an artist s lyrics when determining their MBTI type  Most pop songs are written by a team  and sometimes the artists don t even write all the lyrics to their songs  Additionally  pop lyrics usually take on whatever persona the multiple song writers think are best for the commercial success of the song album  so they are never a guarantee of authentic self expression ,enfj
I just went to his concert he s most ENFJ ever confirmed,enfj
only a sp   man can pull of wearing a dress,enfj
 He s always putting other s feelings before his  that is not inherently Fe  Fi is very prone to do that if its inner moral code is tied to helping other people and feeling that is the right thing to do  and also i ve seen so many Se and Fe arguments but please where the hell do y all see Ni   edit  also have u seen his effing castle  he is clearly Si inferior and that s also why he doesn t really take care of himself and why he s so reckless   he puts Si aside because it is his inferior function aka his worst one  He dislikes change but also hates routine  very Si inferior to me,enfj
 w  and     hm seems kinda wrong,enfj
wait can t we just stop the argument by seeing what his inferior tertiary functions manifest as weaknesses by  i assume si and ti inferior look wildly different hmmm  apologize if not helping  i ll add more once i rewatch but it s better than people going  sooo enfx  without elaborating ,enfj
I saw the movie for the first time yesterday  and I have   questions    Why Fe over Fi    Why Ne over Se   I would have vibetyped him as an ISFP but you may convince me ,enfj
howl is the most ENFP character in the history of media  my proof   mans  calls upon the dark powers  only   times    when a girl dumped him   his hair was ugly   classic ENFP drama queen  he literally said  what s the point of living if you aren t beautiful    he fell in love with the first ESFJ he interacted with  typical ENFP behavior  he trusted a random old woman to be his cleaning lady   that amount of courage combined with stupidity and chaotic energy is only found in Ne doms  immaculate fashion sense and very eccentric  he s like the green ENFP woman but as an anime boy  the only thing messier than his room is his thought process  he is the LAZIEST mfer on the entire planet but only seems to put effort in things he s passionate about  clearly very passion driven  he crated   whole personas just to avoid fighting in a war  as an ENFP i d do it for far less tbh   idk when he turned into a bird that was very ENFP of him don t even ask why it s just something ENFPs would do    if we had the chance  very commited to his ideals and isn t afraid to die for them  ENFJ men annoy me and Howl would never treat me like that  jk he s a man child and so self centered  like every ENFP man i ve ever met   seriously i can t get over the bathroom scene how   how do you not see the clear truth   who does that    who has a breakdown over black hair if not an ENFP  i won t let you gaslight me as an ENFP Howl truther  thank you very much,enfj
i think a common thing i see with the ENFJ arguments is that people are typing howl by what he strives to become rather than typing him by his natural strengths and weaknesses  we should type him by the person he has always been on the inside ,enfj
he is a very apparent ENFJ  first  his fe   literally the whole movie is him putting others feelings and safety before his own  i saw so many comments about him being selfish or not doing anything for other people  have y all even watched the movie  just because he might be whiney at times or got upset when sophie messed with his bathroom  who s to say fe doms can t have breakdowns sometimes  it was literally a couple minute scene in a two hour film and y all run with it  literally the whole movie he fights a war on his own while simultaneously hiding those he loves in his castle and keeping them safe and looking out for their wall being  he is always welcoming to strangers in his home  even when sophie bullied calcifer he invited her to breakfast  he didn t say anything about the witch of the waste who literally tried to steal his heart staying at his home but welcomed her into their family  he clearly cares for social harmony the most  fe doms can also be very insecure and seek validation which is howls case in the beginning of the film  he was an unhealthy fe user in the beginning but towards the end used it for good  his se is also very strong throughout the film hence why se would he perfect as his third function  his ni helps him predict his enemies next move  he is also very imaginative   next  he is a  w  i don t know why it was changed to a  w  when he s an an obvious type    y all  he s not a type   just cause that one time he had a breakdown and he s not a type   just cause he s stylish and lives inside a cool castle  type  s like howl get validation and approval from the outside while type  s get it from the inside which howl does not  when howl freaked out when sophie messed with his bathroom  he was upset not because she messed with his self expression  type    but because she messed with who he is supposed to be   wants to be  type     he was not  how dare you mess up my individuality  he was more  how dare you now i can t pretend to be an ideal image of how i should be   he cares so much about image  yes  he tries to push a beauty oriented persona but that all comes crumbling down because he wasn t being authentic to himself  he wasn t trying to be the most authentic and himself that he can be which type  s treasure  he was more concerned with his image and how he can change his appearance so others can like him  he literally said  what s the point in living if you can t be beautiful   he was an unhealthy and insecure type   in the beginning but towards the end becomes more of  the helper  side of type  s  throughout the film with sophie s help  he finally started to come out of his insecurity and into someone that wants to protect the ones he love   description for self preservation      Like other Twos  Self Preservation Twos focus on meeting others  needs as a way of gaining love  but they also feel a strong opposing pull to hide or withdraw in light of the threat of disapproval and rejection inherent in interacting with others   this is him to the T  he begged sophie to go talk to madame suliman for him and pretend to his whole mom because he didn t want to face her  he has the habit of pushing others and his problems away in the fear of rejection  description for sexual      The Sexual Two is a seducer of particular individuals  Classical seduction is the main approach of this Two  who expresses a driving need to seduce other people as a way of getting their needs met  This seduction   a way of gaining allegiance or inflaming the desire of the other   occurs through the cultivation of an attractive presentation and the expression of feeling   he uses his charm many times throughout the movie in order to have his needs met  i think we see this a lot in him  he s meant to be a handsome and charming wizard after all   conclusion   he is an ENFJ  w  sp sx,enfj
No es un usuario de  Sentimiento Extrovertido  Fe    Howl no buscaba estar bien en el entorno que lo rodeaba  tampoco cumplir con las  obligaciones  que le hab an impuesto y mucho menos participar en el bien com n  Y un ejemplo muy claro de esto que menciono es la guerra que se avecinaba   l no quer a involucrarse en la guerra  de hecho estaba huyendo de  sta y de las  obligaciones  que ten a que hacer en el reino   y de qu  manera lo hac a  Pues viajando en su castillo ambulante y cambiando aleatoriamente de  mundos   olvid ndose forzosamente de lo que realmente estaba pasando  probablemente una persona con sentimiento extrovertido se hubiera involucrado por el bien colectivo  pero Howl no lo hizo porque para  l era m s importante la libertad que otra cosa  Adem s  cuando particip  en la guerra  fue m s que nada porque ya ten a un sentimiento por Sophie  y quer a proteger a las personas que se encontraban con  l en ese momento  De la misma manera se puede notar su  Sentimiento Introvertido  Fi   cuando hace menci n de sus emociones  pensamientos y dem s sin problema alguno  Un ejemplo es su apariencia  cuando su cabello pasa de rubio a naranja  a Howl realmente no le importaba lo que los dem s pensaran o dijeran de su apariencia  sino lo que  l sent a con respecto a  sta  El drama que hizo fue m s que nada porque  l ya no se sent a atractivo  no porque los dem s ya no lo encontrar n as   Otro ejemplo es cuando se deprime porque lo est n buscando en el reino  y menciona que  nicamente quiere ser libre y por eso ha estado huyendo  demostrando estar conectado con sus emociones al grado hasta de derretirse  lo cual es una forma grafica de demostrar como se sent a Howl por dentro   Por  ltimo  y esto no tiene que ver nada con el mbti  pero Howl ten a baja autoestima y la mayor a del tiempo basaba todo en superficialidad  hasta que conoce a Sophie y empieza a desarrollar sentimientos reales por ella  Me encanta Howl  siento que es un personaje incomprendido que hu a de lo que no le hac a feliz  pero a lo  ltimo tuvo que enfrentarse y romper la pared para as  poder tener una vida de verdad ,enfj
I would like my kid to be like me but better in every way possible  I ll prob raise them to be an ENTP  w  ,enfj
Similarity is key ,enfj
I want a child who is what I wasn t  I can t literally do what I want  but he ll have more freedom than me  I want him to make all the difference   And then we will dominate the world,enfj
honestly  i want a kid that ll make everyone around happy and laugh,enfj
I wish for my kids to be happy and experience as much love as possible  Their type is already prewritten before they enter this world and it does not matter which future favourite type you are idealising  every of the    results must be equally loved as parent   Every single type has unique Potential  the inner desire to produce something for the afterlife  there is no better or worse one  You must grind their raw diamond core into a loving spirit  with your spouse or alone  Leading them into the right direction of life  until they have figured out which road they will walk on their own for their ideal to come true  Guide them through coming storms that will imprint cracks on the asphalt  but also let them stumble when the time is right  in order for them to know that the universe is constantly testing them  Their inner and independent will to stand up and continue walking is important  Receiving help is a gift to not take for granted  this is meant to be tought  As long as they grow into decent  friendly  openminded and empathetic individuals  nothing else matters  If your child grows up as the opposite  their model of cognition will mean nothing in comparison to their deeper sphere of personality  Yes  Typology itself is quite meaningful in the context of personal growth  but the foundation is a fateful aid  an extension of better understanding someone else and oneself  but their Persona is so much more than only these measurements  What kind of people they will become is much deeper than what their type is  There are multilayered factors for each type to become the person you want them to be  But you have to let them be as they are meant to be too   The code is already branded into the depths of their heart  so love Se Parent as much as Te Inferior  Every function is so beautiful  the roots of each cognition tree are precious  No matter what your child is going to be  it will be much more than   letters  You will love them so much  that your mind will be nowhere else  but on your family anymore  The ultimate intimate connection you have to build with your child and family in the grand scheme  is highly significant  The only significance is their beautiful soul   ,enfj
I want my kid to be an INFP like me  I feel we would have a much better bond and understanding of one another ,enfj
i think ISFJ s  ESTJ s or ENFP s are likely to be pretty happy people  i hope that if i have kids they ll be happy   ,enfj
ISTP or INTJ,enfj
Not a Fi dom,enfj
Nah I want them to be EXTJs,enfj
makoto isnt a   but a    a so      NINES  Ego Ideal | The peaceful person | Always easygoing and accepting  never pushy or ambitious  NINES  Fixation | Indolence | Mentally diffusing attention so that you forget what is important and refrain from stating opinions and positions  thereby minimizing tension and conflict within yourself and with others  NINES  Passion | Laziness | A lethargy in paying attention to your own feeling  thoughts  and needs  thus disabling desired action  Narcotization examples A Nine has an urgent and complex work assignment that needs to be completed today  but instead of focusing on this priority assignment  the Nine cleans up the office  files old expense reports  makes non urgent phone calls  and works on some lower priority work that is unrelated to the project at hand  and has no looming deadline     Makoto has no reedeming qualities for the killing game except his perserverence  He doesn t avoid his tasks he gave himself or that others do ,enfj
Why sanguine first  He seems more pleghmatic than sanguine,enfj
My favorite protagonist  I know I m basic  don t ask me why  I just find him perfect for protagonist,enfj
I like him so much  Sweet cinamon roll ,enfj
Damn I just realized he s the only survivor  of the first game  with fe ti   like you got te dom togami  te aux kirigiri  te tert asahina and hagakure  te inf touko  and then there s just   fe dom naegi,enfj
our typology is so similar wow,enfj
this guy s fe and ni are both equally so strong  but fe dom slightly makes more sense than ni dom  Also  the se is pretty strong to be inf  His ti is decent and kinda hard to see it as inf  but maybe he is ti inf  because he mainly uses ti for critical situations and he uses in a way of trying to develop it  A very likable and healthy ENFJ btw    w  makes so much sense  btw     over      I mean ofc anyone could be anxious in a killing school  Asahina is a clear  w  but she was so anxious in the killing school  Also the rsn why     bcs triple positive makes more sense ,enfj
Stan Makoto Naegi   ,enfj
Me and this dude will have the exact same typology once his tritype changes to      I see in the comments it is about to change  is this a good thing or a bad thing  Idk who he is,enfj
Weird conspiracy  but I think the protagonists have antennas  because they are receiving wireless senses from us  so we can see the killing game from their eyes  Why else would they have giant antennas for anything else  but that ,enfj
YESSS FINALLY SHE IS ENFJ     I m glad that they released Suki Alone and it also contributes to the avatar universe,enfj
YAY   ENFJ    that s progress  I m so excited   ,enfj
Finally she s ENFJ now  Let s change her enneagram,enfj
Awesome almost there  Let s make her  w   then she s all fixed   Well done everybody  And thank you to the authors of Suki Alone  clearing her type aside  it was above all a really good read ,enfj
i ve come to break the tie  clear fe se smh,enfj
her fe se is the clearest thing in her personality  it can be hard to type her right away because she didn t appear a lot in the show but if you do some analyzing you can see suki is an ENFJ  especially if you take a look at the comics   edit  typos,enfj
ESTP    WHAT    HOW    UFYFKBGEGHFBK,enfj
I thought something seemed off about the ISFJ consensus   I think ENFJ makes way more sense  I can see Fe Se use more than Si dom  She seems to take in sensory details exactly as they are in the present moment  rather than relying on past sensory experiences,enfj
 Suki  Alone  is basically  Fe   the comic   Her being a Fe dom is without question  I can see an argument being made for ESFJ  but I don t really see ANY Ne in her  Even if it was just her third option  it should be visible SOMEWHERE  On the other hand a Ni Se axis makes WAY more sense ,enfj
THIS BOY HAS MY HEART     ,enfj
the ENFP votes make me want to cry  how do you mess up that badly,enfj
Man I was like  This dude reminds me of Oikawa  and then I decided to look up his personality type and ofc hes the same personality type as Oikawa LMAO,enfj
He is not a manipulative mastermind antagonist so he can t be an ENFJ  j,enfj
he seems like either an sx   or an so   core to me  can someone explain the so   votes ,enfj
Anyone ever notice how balanced Ni Se can look like Ne  This guy is a prime example of that ,enfj
Continuing my explanation on his socionics  considering I only explained Fe base last time   The reason I m more certain of EIE over ESE is because of the placement of socio Se  as EIEs are Se valuing  Notice how some of Tamaki s behaviour revolves around his position in the Host Club as a leader or as Host Club King  That s because EIEs are concerned with their position of power within their environment and how to achieve it  ESEs on the other hand are less likely to put on a show or fakery  because of their unvalued Se  They wouldn t be as concerned about their position in a certain group since they re less interested in power dynamics and hierarchy   For his Ni creative  Tamaki is concerned with the evolution and future of his Host Club  he has a strong sense of purpose and rejects the idea of living without a meaning  not only for himself  but also with the people around him  He s usually the first to offer advice and solve problems every time he s witnessed other characters struggling to make women happy or find themselves  ESEs can also be the first to offer advice  but the difference is they focus more on experiences directly in front of them without the reason to explore its purpose and meaning the way Tamaki does   To summarize  he s more symbolic with how he views the world and his place within it  he hated seeing other people waste their potential  which may have played a role as to why he and Kyoya created their Host Club in the first place ,enfj
He s so different from Howl which is truly an ENFJ  w  So Sx  This guy is an ESFJ with an out of control tert Ne and I m sure y all will see it someday,enfj
       My goal today is to try to hopefully persuade you to consider Tamaki as an Ne dom ENFP rather than an Fe dom ENFJ  So here goes   ENFP  Ne Fi Te Si ENFJ  Fe Ni Se Ti  As you can see above  ENFPs and ENFJs share no functions in their primary stack  Which is why this particular vote feels so unfortunate to me  To illustrate Tamaki s functions  I d like to use the following compilation video of Tamaki as reference    Let s start with the judging functions first  Fe Fi Te Ti   Judging functions essentially make a judgement and determine if something is either right or wrong good or bad  Fe and Fi  or valid or invalid true or false  Te and Ti    Fi vs Fe   Fe   determines whether something is good or bad right or wrong based on social values your external group or community has agreed on  Fe doms are hyper aware of group dynamics  social values  and rules of their culture group and will judge whether something is right or wrong primarily based on whether the decision aligns with those values  Think etiquette  being willing to be hyper aware of how others in the room feel and making decisions based on that  etc   Fi   determines whether something is good or bad  or right or wrong  based on your own personal set of values  These values are developed over time based on your observations and experiences   Here are several instances in the compilation video alone that show Tamaki s Fi   Fe  with some additional context to those clips     While Tamaki is a nice and charismatic guy  he rarely shows Fe in his interactions with Haruhi  In the very first scene  he is not paying attention to her reactions at all and continuously rubs her the wrong way by referring to her coffee as a  commoner   Not that he means any harm by it  but he is more focused on his own curiosity  Ne  of how the coffee taste s than Haruhi s or anyone else s reactions or thoughts on the matter  It should be particularly noted that everyone else from Tamaki s social status is hesitant to try it as it s looked down upon  yet he doesn t care and chooses to fufill his own curiosity    Scene at        Tamaki is in the middle of a cafe in public  ripping up trash  pretending it s a pile for a hamster  Ne   because his feelings were hurt  An Fe dom is pretty unlikely to do this  Additionally  the reason his feelings were hurt was because of the exact words he told Haruhi as seen in the previous scene  He couldn t pick up on this underlying relationship  a lack of Ni  of what he told Haruhi and Haruhi s words of  a senpai I just know     When visiting Haruhi         he is completely oblivious to the crowd and how this attention might bother Haruhi  a lack of Fe  Ni  and Se   While he does tell the others to not say things that would hurt Haruhi  he says it loudly enough people far away could hear without realizing  causing Haruhi to overhear and get angry  again  a lack of Fe  Ni  and Se   I would also argue that him telling the others not to say those things is because he personally thinks it s wrong to say personally thinks they would hurt Haruhi and his brainstorming of different words situations that could hurt her shows Ne Fi    When in Haruhi s home         being completely unsure of what could tick Haruhi of because there s  too many possibilities   this isn t directly stated but heavily implied by the scene  shows Ne Fi  rather than go with the flow and feel things out  Tamaki  ENFP   Karou  INFP   and Hikaru  ESTP with tertiary Fe  all struggle with this  while Honey senpai  who I believe is the true Fe dom  ExFJ   leaning towards ENFJ  and Mori  who I believe is an aux Fe user  ISFJ   proceed to interact with Haruhi with ease    Same scene  the trio ask if it s lunch time yet  with the implication that they re going to be served  without any regards to the fact that they are guests in someone s house  Again  I find it hard to believe a dom Fe user would do this without any type of appeal to the person they are asking  It should be noted while Honey senpai joins in this  he works up his  cuteness  charm so it will no be seen with ill intent    Determining to help the newspaper club         Tamaki is ignoring the obvious signs that his host members do not want to help the newspaper club  Instead of trying to figuring out why or trying to smooth out any issues they might have with them  he immediately tries to share his own reasoning of why HE thinks it s important to help them   Do you guys have no feelings at all  Seeing these people when their club is going to be dissolved  you don t feel sorry for them   This is a family being broken up here   This scene alone is Ne Fi Te in a nutshell  Tamaki is oblivious or doesn t care about the newspapers clubs bad rumors  HE sees the family  even tho newspaper club doesn t feel that way themselves  so his Fi   core is saying he must he must help ,enfj
Just finished the anime  wow well looks like I m supposed to read the manga afterwards  Is it possible that we can get a season    I ve read somewhere online that they ve supposedly confirmed it s on the making but I m not sure  ,enfj
Stop voting ENFJ just to say  being nice doesn t equal ESFJ  pls at least try to explain why you think ni si,enfj
for the people who think he s an ENFJ because of yoimiya s line about thoma   He s quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says  Sometimes  it might seem like there s no connection  but as he goes on  everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose   using only this line as an arguement for ENFJ is invalid because it s about both Ni and Ne    it might seem like there s no connection  represents Ne as it takes different patterns that have no relation to each other    everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose  represents Ni as it narrows things down to one outcome ,enfj
I used to have him voted as ENFJ but after reading the ESFJ arguments I m convinced he s ESFJ  His Fe   Si Ne axis is consistent in his character and I think the reason that people say ESFJ voters are arguing based on  stereotypes  is because Thoma is quite literally the healthiest ESFJ  stereotype   I highly recommend reading the ESFJ arguments below me ,enfj
can someone change the   upcoming character   from his profile ,enfj
Aside from ESFJ  I totally think he is            I can t see any need for fun or experience but I definitely see the value of loyalty and security more typical from   fix   And what would make any of you think he is  F     ,enfj
I know that he s a sociable guy  and a lot of people watch things like Frank James and dear kristin and take that at face value  but do we really think Thoma uses Ni and Se  Seems far more plausible that he has tert Ne and secondary Si  considering his partiality to familiarity  stability and routine  An ENFJ would likely become bored by the menial tasks and chores that Thoma does daily  but he in reality finds comfort in them  he tells you as much in his hangout quest    This particular description stuck out to me a lot  from the source on ESFJ s      ESFJs are motivated to help other people in real and practical ways through direct action and cooperation  They are responsible  friendly  and sympathetic  Because ESFJs place such importance on their relationships with other people  they tend to be popular  gracious  eager to please  and talkative  They need harmonious relationships with others and work hard to achieve and maintain them    They attend to and remember important facts and details and like others to be sure of their facts as well  They base their planning and opinions on their own personal experience or that of someone else they trust  They are aware of and involved with their physical environment and like to be active and productive  Because ESFJs are conscientious and traditional  they are bound by their sense of duty and commitments   I m not going to go on very long  but I would highly suggest reading some of these articles and deciding for yourself  if you re still on the fence about it   ENFJ Function Stack and Summary   ESFJ Function Stack and Summary   ENFJ v s  ESFJ Comparisons Differences   Also ,enfj
Finishing Thoma s dates and still don t see Ni Se clearly     He values so much the sensorial information  it s weird when for Noelle  talking about how much she values the housework is a clear Si trait but for Thoma is just  intuitives can also do housework  or when people say that Kazuha uses Si because values past experiences even when he uses Se so much but for Thoma talking about Mondstadt and his homesickness  how much he values his father s teachings which is the reason why he values so much the loyalty with Kamisatos and getting excited for the windwheel aster that we gives to him and talking about the omamori he gives to us are just    not enough because  intuitives can also be nostalgic and think about the past   It s true  nobody is saying that these are Si exclusive  but if we put everything together it tells us more that Thoma s perception is probably closer to Si than Ni  because there is no clear indication that he is someone who solves problems by seeing patterns and making connections instead of using past patterns and finding creative ideas that it s like Si Ne can also work  He is more hardworking  detail oriented  meticulous than conceptual   a well known  fixer  in Inazuma  Even the way he fix problems is just collecting and storing information  knowing about vendors who have quality materials  prices  etc  it is basically an encyclopedia of how Inazuma things and people work and use them to maintain contacts he can trust    not because  he takes care of people in the shadows  has to be intuitive    or that he can see the steps to follow to achieve something that do not seem related  it has to be Ni and not Ne  because he says it  we will come up with something   which speaks a little more about not focusing on a way of doing things  but manages to see the possibilities and is open to seeing different solutions  Idk  it just seems most people just jump to the intuitive bias without considering all the info we have  I m not saying that ENFJ is wrong because some should have good reasons  but the balance of votes is very tilted towards ENFJ without sufficient reasons  Sensors can bargain too  btw      Thoma   It s no big deal  I ve dealt with plenty of situations like this in the past  ,enfj
Thoma is ESFJ  probably  Looking at Thoma s voice lines  his Si Ne axis is more apparent than his Ni Se axis  It seems like people attribute pulling ideas together solely as Ni  where it can just be Si Ne  His Ne presents itself throughout his story quest and the way Yoimiya talks about him   He s quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says  Sometimes  it might seem like there s no connection  but as he goes on  everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose   He easily generates new ideas and seemingly goes off tangent  Ne is a multi dimensional function  seeing not only the pure fact of something  but what relates to it  This seems to be confused with Ni when Thoma is easily able to source back to the root of something  which really is just his Si auxiliary  Si helps pinpoint a more specific insight from Ne s broad  sweeping connections  His thinking process is more Si Ne than Ni Se  Instead of picking out a specific detail and delving deeply into its essence  Ni Se   he diverges from a topic and explores on a broader scope of connections  Si Ne    Let s analyze some of his voice lines as well  all which demonstrate perfect Fe Si    It was never Ayaka or Ayato s intention to make me the housekeeper  I volunteered  I like this kind of work  Putting everything in order gives me a great sense of achievement  and based on everyone s reactions    Yeah  I think I do a pretty good job     For me  housework is about keeping a space clean and tidy  so that everyone who lives there has a smile on their face  And now    it looks like I m responsible for another smile  I ll do my best to deliver    His Fe wants to make other people happy  He constantly acknowledges his accomplishments  only when they relate to how it made others happy  His Si likes to put everything in order   he arranges his physical environment to fulfill his need for congruence and structure  leading him to serve others with his skill for management  Perfect example of Si serving healthy Fe   Lastly  his Concern voice line points heavily to Si Ne axis   I feel like there s something I forgot to do    hmm  I tidied the courtyard  put the tea on    Eh  it s probably just my mind playing tricks on me    We can see that Thoma likes to work on a schedule  He lists the things he s done  but his Ne voice nitpicks at him with what ifs   I feel like there s something I forgot   it s just my mind playing tricks on me   Great example of Ne functioning at the behest of his Si ,enfj
can someone tell me why do u think he has ni aux  i can t see it  gen,enfj
i dont have all thomas voiceline open at the moment but ESFJ seems plausible for him too  I dont understand why people use yoims voiceline as a way to show he has Ni  Sometimes  it might seem like theres no connection  but as he goes on  everything will eventually dovetail nicely torwards a single purpose  isnt this more Ne with it going everywhere and then using Si to sort out the connections between ideas   I made an arguement with him using Ni Se awhile ago but now im starting to doubt it with his new voicelines  He seem to have a comfortable time caring about little things and day to day problems than the bigger picture  not saying an xNxx cant do that but its kind of unusual for him to often overlook big pictures for a lot of little things  saying it s because of his tert feels weird too  because even if people can comfortably use their tert functions  they tend to use their aux  Then get comfy with using the tert   An analogy is  Se is looking at a flower near a river and sees it as only another flower  but Si thinks that its different from other flowers   objective vs subjective view  im a bit leaning torwards Si rn though because of how opinionated and subjective he is torwards things in his physical world ,enfj
Contrasting Love s Fe Se  ENFJ  with Beck s Fe Ne  ESFJ    Love s Fe Se makes her more physically present when communicating with others  and she uses sensuality and physical sensations  cooking  food  sex  to connect with others  But when she uses her Se in an unhealthy way  she becomes impulsive  and too caught up in the present moment to consider the consequences of her actions     Whereas Beck s Fe Ne makes her see the potential and possibilities of others in the future when communicating with them  She is more open ended and uses more abstract  intuitive ways to connect with them  poetry  sharing stories of her past   However  when used immaturely and unhealthily  she becomes wishy washy  unfocused  and too caught up on reminiscing and imagining to actually take action ,enfj
THIS is a sexual    All of these fit Love to a T      The Sexual Two can be direct and even dramatic in the execution of a classical seduction  the capturing of another person s affection and devotion involves an intense  targeted  and passionate effort on the part of the naturally sexy Sexual Two  And this Two aims to secure a relationship through this seduction in which they express devotion and generosity in exchange for whatever it is they want  Because the underlying motive of the aggressively seductive strategy is to get needs met   to basically get a blank check   it can be hard for these Twos to accept limits or take  no  for an answer        Sexual Twos justify their actions  words  madness  wildness  invasiveness  and selfishness in the name of love  as if love were the only emotion  the center of life  the experience that justifies everything  For people with this subtype  love may be conflated with liking or with being desired  For them   love  is about enchanting  seducing and attracting   about maneuvering themselves into a position in which they occupy a special place  Inspiring passion in someone else is their way to fix everything in life  In line with this  they may have a self image of the  ideal lover       The energy of this Two can be seen as  double Two  in that this person moves toward others with the combined force of both the Two  up and out  energy and the Sexual  fusion oriented  instinctual energy  which amplifies their momentum  In relationships  this Two may communicate both a sense of excitement and the intent of a hunter closing in on its prey  Passionate  seductive  and generous  Sexual Twos typically put a great deal of energy into making relationships happen  and can have a very difficult time letting go if a relationship doesn t work out  ,enfj
Such an obvious ENFJ  Comparing her to Beck  you can really see her Fe Se opposed to Beck s Fe Ne  Love has also always mirrored Joe in her Ni usage  Glad to see the consensus is in agreement here  I can see an   fix more than a   fix  especially if you consider it to manifest like social    with a focus on protecting those close to them through any means necessary ,enfj
her ni aux is pretty strong ngl  she always knew joe was a killer and when we re in her point of view her thinking process is highly strategic,enfj
It s from a lot of time that I don t watch the second season  but she is a clearly e fj  She always puts others need other her  her relationship with her brother was an example  etics  values of the society all are for her and in the third season she does everything for integrate herself  also be pleased herself and convince that it s right to hang out people that she despises   Ni   she intuit Joe s thought and she always does connections observing people attitude   SPOILER   In the third season she was in a clearly Fe Se cycle  very impulsive behavior  not thinking about the consequences with all the murders who has committed  Sometimes stressed   Inferior Ti she doesn t focused herself to analyze things in a logical  detached and coherent,enfj
Totally impulsive  Season   shows us she is an ENFP,enfj
Omg Love is on the trending page  just here to say that if you type her on cognitive functions or on letters u still get ENFJ and i have to say i love that  my girl being a very well written character     Can she develop Ti by not gripping every   seconds PLEASE   ,enfj
Do y all not see       fixes like I do   Also she s an FeSe NiTi  ESFJ so technically we should be voting ESFJ but whatever ,enfj
So  look  I KNOW that she s a YOU character and therefore I KNOW I ll regret liking her so much later on  but an ENFJ seductress such as she can whisk me into the sunset any day   Thank you for coming to my TedTalk ,enfj
Best girl Love is trending as she should be    It s crazy how we have the same additional psyches  are both ENFJs  have the same tritype   in the same order at that    and are both type  s  Maybe that s why I can see some of myself in her    EDIT  I don t know who changed her cute season   pfp or why  but I hope your pillow is SCORCHING tonight ,enfj
ela   literalmente a defini  o de  w  pelo amor de deus meus amores,enfj
She s THE  w  what are you guys talking about,enfj
biggest ENFJ i ve ever seen  What you think of as aux fi is idealistic nature of being  w    I want to make world a better place  not just fi also  w  quotes  i agree with ne but ENFJs  th function is ne so they can use it actively  also fe   fi  for example  when they first met Nick she says that she can ignore health violation committed by ice cream seller if they sell ice cream to Nick  If she was an FI user  she wouldnt have done such a thing considering that it was not a principled behavior because she was a police officer  But she did it because she felt strong connection with Nicks friends feelings and dreams so ignored it    also this is a definition of nemesis fi   and i think trickster si makes more sense than trickster ti   i cant understand AP and socionic vote btw  i think she isnt alfa  more like gamma  and  V description doesnt fit her ,enfj
Why is she  w   I think she is stereotypical social  w  ,enfj
I advise you to read the entire thread before agreeing with me                                                                                         I just find this post in my favorite mbti group and decide to share it with you guys  i think its sounds reasoned   Sorry  English is not my native language  so there may be a lot of mistakes  but i guess you will understand what i mean  Judy Hops   ENTJ  w  I decided to give this character a separate post due to the fact that she is typed everywhere as ENFJ  w   And I wanted to discuss this more carefully  I will release a post with other characters  a little later  Firstly  the reasons why she is Fe dom    She helps people   Wants to change the world for the better All this is NOT Fe  This may be the motivation of the Fe user  but it is not an exclusive trait for them  Fe is emotional objectivity  They understand the emotional environment well and read the atmosphere perfectly  Therefore  it is an EXTROVERTED sensitivity  It is directed to collecting emotional information from the environment  Fe understand someone else s moral structure and can adopt it  Is this present in Judy  I think not  Judy does not focus on objective emotionality  and rarely understands the emotional atmosphere  One of the points of the moral system of the society in which Judy lives is that animals cannot be equal  And especially in childhood  it is clearly shown that Judy does not understand this moral conviction  When her parents talk to her after the scene  Judy does not understand where the conversation is leading  They contact the fact that  rabbits can t be cops  after that  Judy is surprised and disappointed  It is clearly stated that Judy did not understand how others felt   this is not a very possible position for ENFJ  After all  they are focused on objective morality and its understanding  Of course  you can say that Judy was little and all children are like that   but it s not true  As a child  we often prefer the dominant function  when the rest come a little later  Therefore  ENFJ in childhood would understand the emotional atmosphere much better than other children  because they almost always use only the dominant function for decisions  When Judy s parents call her to ask how she is doing in her new place and as a policeman  Judy is visibly nervous  she thinks that her parents will be disappointed in the fact that she just gives out fines  Because SHE thinks so  Fi users often believe that their vision is objective  as well as Ni  Ti  etc    even if it is not  They think that what they feel is felt by everyone  The only way to understand the rest well is to feel it for yourself  She doesn  t understand Nick   as she understands herself   At the same time  Nick whose tertiary function is Fe   easily reads it  Easily disassembles her  assuming about her motivations  biography and character   A naive rural bunny with good grades dreams   Now  guys  I will move to Zootopia  where everyone lives in harmony as one friendly family   But he comes  and opanki   friendship does not smell  And her plans to become a cool cop   again opanki  Write out the fines  And opanki number three   no one cares about her and her dreams  Soon they will crash into reality and the poor thing will fall into a deep depression  sleeping under the bridge in a box  There is no other choice but to pack your clothes  and with your tail between your legs  go back to your wonderful  Small Minks  you said where the carrot farm is waiting  This is your destiny  ,enfj
Wait why not social    Ever since she was a little kid  her whole character seemed to revolve around being anti hierarchal power dynamics and social justice    They are helpful Eights people who are nurturing  protective  and concerned with the injustices that happen to people yet they also display an antisocial aspect with regard to the rules of society   She always never cared for what society expected her  as a Bunny  to be  but ignored it     Social Eights are very sensitive to detecting situations in which people are being persecuted or exploited by others that hold more power  When they detect this kind of thing  they tend to act to protect those who are less powerful   She quickly jumped into action to save the other small children who were getting picked on by larger bullies    They are very active  and they may lose themselves through constantly being in action  They may display a disproportionate lust for projects     Judy expressed her lust for her  project  or goal of being a cop and making society a better place quite well    Male Social Eights can look like Type Nines  and female Social Eights may resemble Type Twos  However  these Eights can be distinguished from Nine and Twos because they act in more direct  powerful ways  engage more readily in conflict  and express more power and control in seeking to protect and support other people   It makes sense that a female social   got typed as a    but I don t see much social   in Judy at all compared to social    It s honestly quite disappointing that there s not a single social   vote   And why Sanguine and not Sanguine Choleric  She s very goal oriented  leader like in her way of taking initiative  and easy to push others to work and to their goals  too  And I think a double extroverted temperament would make a lot of sense for her  Not to mention the moment she sees a goal or is given an assignment  she feels the need to go up and beyond  and works so hard towards doing so   And can anyone explain why  V  She doesn t seem very lenient with her goals as  V would be ,enfj
who in the world voted for ESTJ and INFJ where is the introversion,enfj
Ok I don t even watch this movie but it s so clear that s she s a   just based on what you learn about her alone  she s more driven towards  justice  and  duty  than she is about  being loved ,enfj
Thoughts on Judy possible being ENTJ  Saw a comment section on tiktok full of people who think ENTJ ,enfj
make  w  judy hopps happen y all,enfj
how do you guys see her as an extrovert  she tends to be very shy  even with her friends  genuine question  not criticism or anything ,enfj
That can explain why barbruh is so good,enfj
just saying this bow cuz its on my mind especially with the ppl saying INFJ n stuff  if you dont understand cognitive functions  how mbti actually works dont vote on these  its not just about are you an inrovert or extrovert  intuitive or sensing and so on  thanks   ,enfj
If people don t mind giving spoilers to a noob  what happens in Barbara s hangout quest  I could google it but I also want to know more about why she s an ENFJ  because I want to know more about Ni ,enfj
gosh im never gonna get over that specific ending of the hangout where traveler beats the treasure hoarder and he leaves without getting treated by barbara so she just leaves  saying it s getting late   THATS SUCH ENFJ BEHAVIOR OF HER LIKE getting frustrated and sad over not being able to help  while not  showing it  and finding excuses so she wouldn t get traveler worried   we just love ENFJ in that kind of situations    ,enfj
The Barbie of Genshin Impact kinda  now i am saving her page bcs i love barbie and even i like genshin barbie   D  Also i am not sure if shes ESFJ or ENFJ  Btw  w  makes most sense  her desire is to be loved by others  fe dom is obvious  she loves social harmony the most  I really dont know if shes si ne or ni se        edit  also obvious   core  And her   disintegration really showed out bcs of the fandom lol barbruh slapping people by her attack and her Elemental burst and healing scary version lol   even in hangout quest and voicelines  she screamed  w  ,enfj
She must be the real villain  therefore  ENFJ ,enfj
ENFJ   i swear she was an ESFJ like a month ago   she s on my team and i didn t even know her type this is despicable,enfj
definitely an introvert if you play her hang out quest,enfj
pretty much agree on all other typings but why     and why Sanguine dominant  her   wing comes out often and is very obvious in her infriority complex  with Jean  i dont know how she would be a   even though she is optimistic she has lots of worries herself  she is not very focused on avoiding negative emotions  she is always worrying herself  she is also much more fitting with the sanguine phlegmatic blend than pure sanguine   The Sanguine Phlegmatic is driven by two temperament needs  The primary need is to be accepted socially  The secondary need is to accommodate others  Either need may dominate their behavior depending on the requirements of the situation   When the Sanguine and the Phlegmatic natural tendencies are combined  it produces a people person who is accommodating to the needs of others  They are more relationship oriented and consistent than the other Sanguine combinations  This combination naturally relates well to others and they maintain lasting relationships  ,enfj
You can be Si PoLR and have aptitude for fashion  lol  Rarity is dramatic and prone to bouts of fantasy  Pinkie is an ESE  the emotions she creates are very grounded and presently focused  Rarity draws on inward creativity to make unique designs  She portrays the Ni ego romance style in the early seasons with fantasizing about being swept away at the Gala by a  knight in shining armor  type character  Rarity doesn t satisfy the comforts of others nearly as frequently as either of the Si ego main characters  Si also includes the ability to maintain mental composure  and this is a character that famously breaks down  swooning onto couches  Frankly  she s one of the more clearly defined EIE s I ve seen in fiction  Lots of emotional energy  flights of fantasy  and need for stability from others   An episode in the later seasons even sees her Se hidden agenda  and Ni creative  in action  when she obtains a book that allows her to bring to reality anything she imagines  a power she quickly takes beyond what is reasonable   Not to mention  Alpha is a democratic quadra  Beta is aristocratic  Rarity displays a pretty clear preference on that regard  She s also more of a negativist when juxtaposed against the actual ESE main character on the show   Also  for a real life example of an EIE with unusual fashion choices  look at popular singer Lady Gaga  Sensors are not the exclusive claimants of aesthetics  I just don t see that  Creative works of any kind can be intuitively based as well as sensory  and clothing can evoke many aspects of the Socion  If you were to try and define Se based and Si based styles of dress  you would not have a hard time seeing the differences ,enfj
ESFJ   She s prissy and cares a lot about details  She s Si when she talks about this  that  the proper way and makes references to the past  Where is the Ni  She knows how to take care of people but not to lead the world toward a philosophical uprising as she hates change like with her dresses  This site is so inaccurate ,enfj
HOW IS SHE EIE   JUST BCS SHES KINDA BOSSY AND KINDA MEAN and MOST OF YOU DISLIKE EIE s  ALSO TBH NOT ALL EIE S ARE BOSSY AND MEAN AND STUFF    Btw there is NO WAY SHES SI POLR  she cares wayyyyy too much about aesthetics  comfort  appearance  health etc  Btw also fe si base makes sense  and her socio se seems rather demonstrating than  d  Also ni polr makes more sense  Also imo she is more of an  w  than and  w   Also so sx makes more sense  sx   s are very more focused on being charming and and attractive and concentrate more on relationships  so   s want to be charming and attractive too but they are more assertive and confident than sx   s  Also sx   s are very shy and very         or   enneagram like ,enfj
Why I think  w     w    w   Maintaining a favourable image  deceit    Tries to be indispensable   pride  Wants to be admired upfront  Their identity is based on being their culture s ideal  Their self worth depends on their desirability  They try to hide their deep seated neediness    w   Maintaining a favourable image  deceit    Longing for something that is missing in themselves or their lives   envy  Wants to be admired from afar  Their identity is based on their craft  Their self worth depends on their success  They try to hide their deep seated sorrow     w  is more outgoing  charming  they are more about making connections to get people to value them    Rarity does this constantly  she is motivated towards making connections with high class ponies like fancy pants in canterlot   She is always about what s popular with her fashion designs  She s always talking about whats in season  whats popular right now  etc  Her entire career is about being based on her culture s ideal   A four wing would be more about crafting an identity that stands out and focusing on personal goals  this is Rainbow Dash  not Rarity    s want to be different  twos want social approval  Individuality   collectivism  This is never Rarity   I do not think Rarity s melodramaticness points to a   wing  certainly not being type    She has never been shown to believe her emotions and suffering makes her unique  She is just a dramatic type   ,enfj
I was surprised to see only two ESE votes  Why EIE  Si PolR Rarity   Rarity s ALL about aesthetics and she s so in tune with these details  I personally think Si creative fits her perfectly  According to Stratiyevskaya   The ESFJ is typically confident in his aesthetic tastes and opinions  He knows this about himself and considers this to be his strong quality  For each person  he could choose a complimentary clothing set  make up  and hair style  which would correspond to his appearance and his character  Even some of the other sensing types  not to mention intuitives  should take ESE s suggestions into consideration  Some representatives of this type make for excellent stylists and designers     Rarity in a nutshell  I don t want to copy paste the whole thing  but scroll to Si as a creative function  it fits Rarity so well    Si creative is characterized by the ability to be creative with changing the qualities of their surroundings and recreate aesthetic sensations  They re  naturally good at organizing activities and recreation  and  attuned to people s tastes and personal preferences   Compare to Si PolR descriptions        manifested in a relative lack of awareness of the immediate surroundings  as in noticing where objects may be if you don t have to deal with them particularly  and of your own physical sensations   They typically lack attention to aesthetics and details  but Rarity has no problem taking care of herself and being fussy about the smaller details  Alpha suits her more than Beta  Sure  she can be pushy  but that s just Se demonstrative  but she seems much more focused on potential and ideas  socio Ne  based on these different Si aspects  I haven t watched a lot of the series  but she seems clearly ESE to me ,enfj
I have so many thoughts on her enneagram type honestly  She s so heart triad that each type within it looks possible to me    I can see her as a  w  due to her healthy   integration  at her best being in touch with herself and her inner creative desires  If she were a    I think she d be So Sx  she does a great job at putting on an image of success  as well as sweet talking in order to get her needs met  My argument falls somewhat flat when it comes to that   stress  it s hard to notice  as under stress she seems to become more complacent  much like a   or       In Season   episode     she doesn t find joy in success if she can t be her authentic  creative self  This leans more to    or maybe even    Her stress during this episode represents a   stressing into a    as she becomes complacent  sewing dress over dress    The reason I lean away from   is that I don t see her feelings of inferiority to other ponies  however  this could be the self preservation    She does tend to work hard to achieve those  far off things   much like that variant of    However  to my knowledge  the series doesn t seem to touch on any kind of feeling of inferiority    Leaning to  w  for her might be my bias  as I m a    and a kinnie lol   but at the end of the day I m incredibly torn on what to vote for her  so I m interested to hear how anyone else interprets her type ,enfj
seeing her not typed as  F genuinely shocked me  i can understand the  E votes but i think  F suits her much better  is there any reason people think  E    F  i would copy and paste a description of  F here to really emphasise how similar to  F she is but i ll just do that when someone responds cause i can t really be bothered atm  ,enfj
 Reposting my reply about why Rarity is not Sx So   I added few things   Sexual   is not only about attractiveness  it s also focused on being best in relationships  Focused on being best romantic partner  friend  sister  brother  son  daughter  Being best in whatever role they have in relationships  However as I remember Rarity s conflict with her sister was because she didn t spend time with and generally was annoyed with her  When her friends was helping to her with her dresses   she started to be extremely bossy  because she worries about her work a lot  It doesn t look like she cares about being successful in terms of relationships  There are many conflicts that are centred around her prioritizing admiration work over relationships  Rarity is generally kind and generous towards those who mean a lot to her  but they are not her main focus   Sexual  s are also not really focused on achieving success through work or skills  capable of  but not interested in it   They think that their relationships determine their success  Which is absolutely opposite of Rarity  she prefers hard work and wants to earn respect through her creativity and artistic abilities  And even her passion for attractiveness is centred around her career path  When she is failing at her job   she doesn t care how she looks and how attractive she is  And sx  s are also more shy and reserved than other  s ,enfj
She is the definition of  F wdymmm,enfj
Rarity is proof ENFJs are charasmatic cult leaders  j,enfj
I m not seeing much Fi in Moana  This girl is repeatedly making decision based on what other people think  Her wanting to leave the island is not an indicator for Fi  since everyone can have personal desires  especially considering her enneagram   What Fi is  is valuing these desires more than people s opinion on them  which is not what Moana does    She literally lies to herself and denies her desire in the song Where You Are  People with Fi don t confuse what they want with what the community want like this  this is Fe  She leaves the island to search for Maui because her grandmother tells her  She gives up on her journey because Maui tells her she is not good enough  She continues her journey because her grandmother tells her to believe in herself  Changing her opinion about herself this quickly and based entirely on outside feedback is Fe  not Fi    Her  Fi  comes entirely from her grandmother  It is her grandmother that tells her to follow her heart and makes her reflect about who she is  Even the phrase that constantly says  I m Moana of Motunui     is something that her grandmother taught her to say  Being adventurous and not obediently doing everything her parents tell her does not mean she has to be and ESFP or rules out ENFJ ,enfj
I know that someone probably already said this  but all her   I wish I could be the perfect daughter  but I come back to the water  no matter how hard I try   and   The ocean chose me for a reason   sounded a lot like Se Fi to me    ofc it has been a looong time since I don t watch the movie but even if she was just an ENFJ with a well developed Se  I wonder where would be her Fe  because I don t really remember her using it once  Moana s very impulsive and an adventure seeker  wanting to explore the ocean even when others said she mustn t go because it s dangerous  which could be some of the traits of Se  but not exclusively Se  I guess   It could also be her    but I don t think that her impulsiveness comes only from her    I also don t see Ne on her  neither inferior Si  so I can t actually understand the ENFP votes  but it s ok ,enfj
the function stack lmao  ,enfj
does anyone have an argument for her sociotype  I don t think ESE fits her much though im not sure what else to type her as  I was thinking SEE  but again im not sure ,enfj
this page is a mess lmao but i agree w ESFP votes  se is so prevalent on moana too strong to be tert imo,enfj
Don t under estimate any personality type s Tert function  ENFJ s Se can be strong  You may find ENFJ open to adventures  from ski to diving  from dancing to adapting new products  Height  Sharks  But the fun looks no brainer  so why not   She was a mission driven  dedicated action taker without being distracted until mission accomplished  And the mission was to save her island  Which is her Fe Ni thing    The purpose of her story is not adventure but being brave to take on the journey for her island  Purpose matters for Dom function     Don t downvote me just because I m using her photo   ,enfj
ENFJ  You guys are kidding  I dont see Fe  she is impulsive and adventure seeker  Wanna go to the sea out of island Eep s wanna go the outside of cave  Both are ESFPs with Si father ,enfj
Se Fe Idk where you see de dominate    Sorry for my Bad english ,enfj
SJ voters   explain Si  I d genuinely like to know ,enfj
Moana is definitely a Se dom  She wants to go out and explore and experience the ocean and have new  exciting experiences outside of her island  She s very action oriented and strikes me as less of an ideas person daydreamer  Ne dom  and is much more interested in  doing     I m not sure what her Enneagram is  but I am a bit confused about the reasoning for her being a  w  ,enfj
I don t get it  Si vs  Se is really simple at heart   Si  Sensations are a form of data  They can be enjoyed  but are meant to be memorized and catalogued for future use   Se  Sensations are experiences  They can be useful  but are meant to be enjoyed in the moment   What makes people think Tanjiro just enjoys experiences for the moment  He s the killjoy of the party more often than not  He sticks to a regimented course   He s not like Inosuke  He doesn t just run off headlong into battles for the thrill of adventure   Tanjiro is a planner  who meticulously observes and compares the details of his surroundings and his opponents moves  He doesn t look for patterns  he s looking for an opening ,enfj
I only saw the first episode and I can already tell that this man is a Fe dom ,enfj
Isn t his enneagram supposed to be  w  because of dominant Fe ,enfj
Ele combina muito mais com  w  e o Rengoku com  w ,enfj
the healthiest ENFJ i have ever seen his fe    ,enfj
Can someone explain why  w     w   ,enfj
The most ENFJ character i have ever seen omg  I want to say he must be protected at all costs but he would do that himself for others please,enfj
Hi  this is off topic with Tanjiro but could someone tell me how to find out your big    I don t really know how it works but i want to learn  I have tried some tests but i dont know how to read the results  So if someone could tell me how to know my big   or give me a good test please  Thanks,enfj
His Fe is sooooo clear  especially with how he empathizes with the demons despite not knowing a lot about them,enfj
very high Fe clearly visible basically from the beginning already probably the only XNFJ main character i like in anime,enfj
I think he has too strong Se fi  but like  why ENFJ  Where is the ni ,enfj
Is he fi or fe im so confused        On some parts  he seems driven by fi  and on others he doesnt  Manga spoilers  I remember this scene with mitsuba in picture perfect arc  he tries to jump after mitsuba s talk about how kou couldn t possibly understand him cuz he s a human  despite the fact that he came to talk to him with the prior agenda of getting him out of there And personally speaking  this seemed like an impulse decision by his fe  and also inf ti  because he didn t think about how the others would feel if he died  and i believe mitsuba mentioned that ,enfj
He s so hard to type    I m so confuse between ENFJ and ESFP  ,enfj
imo he s ESFP  he looks like an fe dom bc he s a   on the enneagram  its the same w nene  can we let fi users who are nice and put themselves before others exist  manga spoilers him vowing to save nene even though supernatural beings and a literal ghost told him it s not possible  he s dead bent on getting mitsuba s memories back  jumps in front of hanako to protect him from his brother  this man holds the strongest moral values ever and does not quit until he himself wants to quit  seems very Fi to me  he s never made decisions to appeal to the emotions of others  unless he s just doing something kind for his friends  or trying to get someone to like him  which are   tendencies  voting him as Fe dom simply bc he does these things seems very shallow  i also think kou immediately deciding to save nene w o even thinking about how to save nene in the first place is the peak example of Se overriding Ni   he even overuses his Se to the point where he s unable to acknowledge that he might not be able to save nene at all ,enfj
I believe that he is a high Fe and Se user but why Ni   Can someone explain pls  ,enfj
can someone explain how he s a sexual two   i do not see it  maybe im missing something idk,enfj
WOAH REALLY   This shocking me  I m not sure his type so I don t vote it but I think ENFJ is little bit too far maybe  ,enfj
Where are the ESFP votes even coming from  I d understand if this was a ENFJ vs ESTP debate  but when does this man display Fi Te,enfj
is there an ENFJ argument that isn t him being in an Fe Se loop  gen couldn t find any and I don t want to have to scroll like    pages   but loops and grips are uh kinda iffy I honestly have a lot of difficult seeing him as an Fe user at all though  especially compared with his brother  Teru  someone who is VERY VERY much an INFJ doesn t focus on his own personal values at all  for him it s just  I m expected to exorcise supernaturals so I will  and he s very not empathetic towards Kou when Kou starts doubting this  For Kou though what he thinks is right and wrong is clearly a lot more important  I mean I m not trying to do Fi is when morals  I m not very good at explaining so im kinda worried it might come off like that  since Teru clearly has strong values as well but for Kou it really seems to come a lot more from within  I mean I don t want to be bad faith here but im lowkey getting the impression he s only voted ENFJ because people mistake Fe for kindness    and why inferior Ti he seems to better fit inferior Ni  he is a very impulsive and straight forward person and I don t see much of a struggle with him to make decisions by his personal logic ALSO PLEASE READ THE MANGA BEFORE VOTING the anime is only    episodes so it can t develop the characters anywhere near as well as the manga does and for Kou specifically cuts out very important characterization for him  mainly the chapter where he decides not to exorcise Hanako  a chapter where his Fi is made really clear ,enfj
I love the fact that no one argues about whether Oikawa is an ENFJ  It is extremely obvious which his personality type is ,enfj
Why  w  instead  w   I see more wing   than wing    Yes  he does everything to help his team and   type users can be selfish too  but he helps the team because it s the only way to reach his own archives,enfj
hey why SLOAI  im new with the big five so if someone could explain it to me thx,enfj
As my friend   OfficerBacon  remarked  if he were wing    the motive would be  success through the helping of others to warrant recognition back  They can still be prideful  but more in a  look what i ve done for you  regard rather than the more self absorbed w   who desires recognition for how specifically talented they are     I would have to agree with this assessment  he helps others because the team sport requires that  and in his mind his personal sense of excellences is demonstrated by how good he is at it his role  In reality  he doesn t have a tendency towards the  look what I ve done for you  mindset from   s pride  Rather  the team s success is a reflection of the team s strength  and indirectly brings him satisfaction as the  control tower  of it  a role where the excellence he has in it is uniquely his  along with the collective satisfaction of the team too  he is a Fe dom after all   And  his character arc also grapples with the   struggles of the fear of insignificance and inferiority    As for Fe dom  he prefers to work by adapting himself to his teammates  needs  creating a sense of communal rapport and unity  Fe   rather than preferring to deal with the mechanical metrics  Te  and letting those social dynamics sort themselves out as a byproduct of this logical entity to govern the team    The aim is to make sure everyone is accommodated for rather than to create an impersonal formula to move people around with  treating them as consisting of logical  abiotic  entities  And if he were Fi inferior  there would be a far more depersonalized take to this  with tendencies to trample upon the individual natures of people in favor of the formula  which is never a problem for Oikawa ,enfj
idk how u guys r seeing type   over   he does stuff for his personal validation   him being a bubbly popular dude does not equate to  w  LMAO he tries to seek his own worth thru individual progress   feats  which is why he overworked himself in the first place    not for others   ,enfj
I feel like some people have simply checked out the enneagram tritypes on this page and just copied   pasted the whole personalities into the characters  In my opinion he s a  w   it s just the way I perceive him to be honest  I feel like some of his  behaviors  throughout the series would suggest a   wing,enfj
Why w  over w   Oikawa literally didn t come to shiratorizawa because he wanted to individually show how good he can be and that he can beat others himself  He is also prone to envy others and their natural talents  His main thing is that out of envy he worked so hard to be the best and this is also I think the reason he got knee injury ,enfj
ngl he has more of a wing   than a wing    He s def a Fe dom and I think people are confusing that with a wing    Whilst his drive to be more  special  and his hatred for being inferior or just being like the average volleyball player makes him spiral unhealthily  He also presents the typical  envious  demeanor of a    though I guess you could argue for    pride  as well   and I just think he exhibits much more self reflection and ambition that relates better to a  w  rather than a  w   which is more social  I think that s pretty much covered by his Fe,enfj
I don t understand  why   fix ,enfj
very very obvious ENFJ you can see her fe dom in the whole manga anime unlike the rest of the crew she is the easiest to type based on mbti followed up by that ni aux that makes her goal oriented and helping her find out the patterns between things and making plans to only reach one objectibve and a surprisingly well developed se  her mbti is out of question and there is no chance for anything except for ENFJ  but her enneagram and tritype is quite odd  the only reason people are saying   is because of her kindness and her caring for others and there are solid reasons on both case so could someone reply telling me their opinion  thanks ,enfj
I get shes helpful and all  but that does not necessarily mean she s a type    ,enfj
Fi wut  ,enfj
Why is she being voted as a    She doesn t fear not being loved at all    A helpful person isn t automatically mean they re an enneagram two   ,enfj
maybe i m being controversial with the enneagram here  but beatrice chestnut s descriptions of the instinctual variants are really helpful and point pretty clearly to an sp sx    i highly recommend reading beatrice chestnut s descriptions  i also don t think she s a social type because she isn t really working for status and structure  but rather for material security  protection  of herself and others   and supporting her loved ones  she is also quite hard on herself  which fits with the motives of a   over a    maybe i m totally off the mark here  i haven t seen the second season  but i still think that my point of view is worth at least considering  again  BEATRICE CHESTNUT   ,enfj
can someone provide a good argument as to why she s a     i don t see   core motivations nor fears for her at all  she seems much more concerned with keeping the peace than being loved  and fears losing her family more than being rejected by them   manga spoilers below  on top of that she literally convinced herself that she agreed with norman s plan bc the rest of her family agreed with it  and it took pressure from ray to actually address the conflict     Social Nines can be workaholics  they feel a need to work hard and give a lot  But it s not just work they energetically demonstrate friendliness and sociability  they don t show their pain  they don t burden others  and they don t show people how much energy it takes to devote so much effort to the community  These are people who are generous and unselfish  mindful of the group  and gifted in meeting the needs of others to the point where they sacrifice themselves to satisfy the responsibility others want to put on them         literally tell me that this is not emma  she literally made a promise with a mf demon lord  agreed to lose every memory of her family just so they would be safe  emma  who also bottled up literally every ounce of negativity she felt as to avoid burdening the group    i also see her disintegrating into   at several points in the manga  ex  after yuugo died and she found out the secret abt the house    We can still fight if it s the worst situation  We can still win if it s the worst situation  But how    I need to think    What different measures can I take       Emma before she fought Leuvis  Two were already killed  I absolutely cannot let anybody else die  But with    of us  we ll have no mobility  If an enemy attacked in the middle of the night  we would be okay because Yuugo and Lucas are so strong  but if the enemy still has any ambushes  we wouldn t be able to handle it  There s a possibility that they ll attack through our escape route  so what should I do to keep everybody safe     Emma panicking after the loss of Yuugo   Lucas  every time she was in a confrontation she tried to find a way to avoid it and find compromise     Don t you have a choice not to fight  Do we have to kill each other     Emma again  before she fought Leuvis  We don t intend to kill you  We came here to talk to you     Emma to Peter Ratri   Social Nines make very good leaders the best kind of leaders  in fact in the sense that they are good  unselfish people who strive to satisfy the responsibility given them  They can be especially gifted mediators  they naturally want to translate differing opinions so that everyone is heard and conflict in the group is avoided  They put a lot of energy into their work as a leader  They have an ability to bear a lot  sometimes to the extent that they become a  human punching bag   These Nines give of themselves unconditionally as a response to a deeper  sometimes unconscious  fear of abandonment  conflict  separation  and the potential loss of peace and harmony    flashback to gilda and ray lecturing emma because she was carrying so much on her shoulders  even when faced by peter ratri and an army of moms with guns  she was able to empathize with them and encouraged him to join them and take the high road instead of just killing him  she was able to put herself in the demon s shoes w o any difficulty as well when the rest of her family suffered doing the same thing    But I don t want to resolve this by killing you  Hating  resenting  fearing    I don t want to do that anymore  All those feelings    are things that I don t want anymore     Emma  also i can already hear the  emma is too outgoing and fierce to be a nine  so here u go      In contrast to the other two Nine Subtypes  who tend to be more subdued characters  Social Nines are very outgoing and energetic this is what makes this the counter type Nine  Social Nines have a special brand of strength because they feel motivated to fight for the needs of the group  Social Nines are extroverted  expressive  and forceful  and so they go against the inertia typical of Type Nine in some ways but on the inside they still have a sense of laziness about their own needs and wants     yall need to remember high fe doesn t always equal   and vice versa  i can see why u could see her as a   in the first season of the anime  but definitely not in the manga ,enfj
ENFJs are such beautiful people  They are so caring and generous  I want ENFJs to know that they are loved and special  They deserve it more than they know  ,enfj
Relate to her even though I m not the same MBTI type ,enfj
I m still looking for a good enneagram   argument    she seems just like a social   to me,enfj
can someone explain Ni  like  when he uses it  and are we sure he isn t an Fi user who is benevolent enough to look like an Fe dom  I dont understand Se tert either  not saying he isn t an XNFJ but just very skeptical,enfj
Why so many INFJ votes  He s more driven for greater purpose of people than the deeper meaning of things Fe   Ni  He lives way too much in the moment  and too appreciative of sensory pleasure for Se inferior  not saying an INFJ can t but that tends to be their struggle  And I don t see Ti tert   Btw nice   to   integration when he got JACKED   ,enfj
I honestly still think that Iroh is INFP  I mean  he can very easily state what ideal metrics would be most preferable for him  and can go on and on about it for hours  and he very much has an intrigue for new tastes  How many times have we heard Iroh say something like  all I want is  followed by some long monolologue of what tea shop he would like  where he would like it to be and the ideal insignia for his tea shop  I feel as if people may vote him as Fe due to his helpful and understanding nature of others  but I persinally see very little detachment from his subjective judgement  Casually Iroh is pretty disagreeable in regards to external metrics  One scene I think of immediately is when he and Zuko were escaping as fugitives and he started criticizing the way tea was being made  talking about the way it should be in alignment to his values    I think the biggest strength that Iroh shows in the show is self knowledge  which is highly correlative with Fi usage  Because even when he talks and listens to other people  his resolution seems to center around him pushing the individual to find what they value  and helping them figure that out  rather than forsaking subjective judgement just to understand people  He has rather strong opinions about how people should live their life  its just his strong opinions happen to carry alot of wisdom    From my perspective he is one of the strongest examples of knowing yourself to know others  because in very casual settings Iroh is strongly led by subjective needs for external metrics  He pushes for individual tastes while also being open and considerate of new ideas   I think his enneagram is likely  w  sx so or So sx  He quite easily puts away his agenda for the group and for individuals  but he seems more individually focused  and I think that may be mistaken for Fe  as I dont notice a detachment from subjectivity in his casual interactions ,enfj
hear me out  hear me out  INFJ ,enfj
For him I only see two possible types ENFJ which is very likely or an enlightened ESTP  Its a bit hard because he is firstly old and secondly had rather exceptional life experiences  When portrayed in the flashback of Zuko for example writing about nearly conquering Ba Sing Se and joyfully joking about that I think se and fe were always shown quite well also when the story starts and he is mostly just a side character who constantly wants to cheer Zuko up and wants him to enjoy life a bit more or rather focus on what is truely his right destiny instead on merely being a tool of his father  The deeper side of the character gets only slowly added like at the end of Book   when Zhao kills the fish and Iroh suddenly becomes very serious and shows that there is sth  more to him than he lets on but I also would advise not to take the spiritual and wise characteristics as ni perse as the way he got into them or interacts with them is quite sensoric in my view  So yeah I think ultimately ENFJ is prob  correct but only because his function axes are ti fe ni se in some combination and I think people thoughts process are more smart old mentor type must be xnfj  Well ENFJ could be but he is nearer to lets say a se dom ESTP than a ni dom INFJ when we try to realistacally take his whole character with all his background from forceful and somewhat brashful general who gets humbled by his sons death and then grows into a more spiritual wise and understanding person beyond of what he once thought was his immediate purpose or calling as his perception suddenly expanded beyond what was immediate ,enfj
I thought he was so       How is he sx,enfj
It s impressive how he managed to cure the Fi Ni loop Zuko was going through  I can tell you it s really hard when you have a strong vision fueled by your personal values  It feels like you deny your own persona when you try to change that vision  Iroh managed to do that and make Zuko change sides and acknowledge who his real self is ,enfj
Can you explain me why he is sx so ,enfj
Hear me out y all  I think Iroh is an Fi user  not an Fe user   Of course Iroh loves to help people  not to mention he has a   fix  which makes him look like an Fe user  but he has chosen helping people and making peace as his life goal BECAUSE IT FEELS RIGHT TO HIM  It is in line with his internal morals  which don t depend on the groundwork others have laid in place beforehand  This is Fi  Iroh was on the Fire Nation s side of the war  but dissociated himself with their goals only after the war affected him personally  and impacted his own internal emotional world  Fi  An Fe user would have either stayed with the Fire Nation and adopted their morals as his own  or seen the negative affects of the war on everyone and left due to a sense of duty to the world  Iroh left when the war felt wrong to him personally  This is also evident in his discussions with Zuko  Zuko needs to do what feels right TO HIM  not fulfill a responsibility to society  Fi  I also see Ne over Ni  Iroh is all about looking at things from new perspectives  and he loves to explore and take in new information  He s open to new interpretations  even thrives on them  An Ni user would have a much more fixed vision of the future  and be stubborn about achieving it   I also think  w  over  w  because he s quite assertive  and a little less rigid and more playful than a  w  would be  I also see sp so because he is very invested in creature comforts and routines  sp   and likes to be part of a group  so   I don t see much of sx   s desire to  merge  with others  as Iroh is quite independent   Anyway there s my long rant  If you made it this far  thanks for reading  ,enfj

sloai    A wild imagination  idealist heart  and strong intellect make the Perfectionist a popular and engaging person  However  your sensitivity and self scrutiny can work against you  and your commitment to perfection can give you unrealistic expectations   doesn t this sound like monika a lot  in the game  she s known to be very popular  she was known to be very very considerate and kind  always caring about others   now about scoai vs sloai here s how people with high neuroticism act     Or you may have done something morally wrong  so you feel guilty  However  not everyone has the same reaction to a given situation  High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear  anger  sadness  and the like  Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on   how does monika show this   she underwent an epiphany which made her discover that she was in a game and also granted her the ability to edit the game s variables  changing her attitude towards the other girls because she knew they were not  real   She begins taking drastic measures when the other girls prevented the player from being able to spend time with her during the scene in Act   where the player has to choose a girl to help for the festival  In desperation  Monika begins trying to make the other girls unlikable by altering their traits  as she only had the ability to edit variables in the game and did not want to delete kill the other girls right away because of her lingering attachment to them  From Act   onward  she becomes even more manipulative  As the time goes by  she resents more and more having no romantic role in the game  as that meant there was no happy ending coded for her      another thng  in ddlc plus  she s shown to be overly perfectionistic  more then in the original game  and doing thngd like     This has been shown through a scene where Monika couldn t even write anything on a piece of paper due to the fact that she was too focused on starting the writing perfectly  She was only left with a black spot of ink that she smeared on the top of the page while writing underneath that this was the result of her being a perfectionist     i mean    doesn t this sound like sloai   correct me if i m wrong bc i m still new to big  ,enfj
  If you re anything like me  I know you re scared to not accomplish much in life     her reply when you tell her you feel inadequate | after story mod  peak  w  core  looking as her relations to people and connecting to another as one of her  achievements  rather than a goal to a perfect life,enfj
how is she calm   limbic lol  her actions scream sloai to me ,enfj
I m not great with reasoning at all  however here s my take on this  I ve heard good arguments for both ENFJ and INFJ but I feel like the true colors of Monika show when she becomes self aware and does everything to be with MC  and it clearly shows Fe dom  Sure  in the side stories she could be an INFJ  but that s most likely just what she s programmed to be before she became self aware  But for now I m not gonna vote any four letter type because I m still open for arguments and corrections  Correct me please if i m wrong thanks   ,enfj
 reposting my comment in a thread because i think it s useful to people understand better her ENFJ    hello again    ENFJ still has Ni Ti to start with   but what you said about a supposed argument about her being INFJ can be features also predicted in an ENFJ  because nothing that you said of hers confirms that she uses ni as dominant or ti as tertiary  let s get this straight    if Monika had Ni as her main  the whole architecture of her manipulation would be different  if her Ni were main  she  through pattern perceptions  would be open to create a concrete plan to get rid of that situation  and to communicate with the player directly  her strategy would be directly related to her ability to recognize information  Ni  and not to the emotion of how she feels about it  Fe    the dominant Fe of monika is extremely obvious when she starts from the extroverted feeling moment  she wants to be chosen  she wants to feel human as well as the player  she wants at the same time to ensure that the club is something special for the other girls  she wants the result satisfying for her  reaching a level of extreme game manipulation to achieve that  Monika is extremely smart  but I disagree with you when you say she acted logically  she saw logic in that  and even based her lower Ti on many times during the game  but her main action and her main objective was driven by emotion   the main comment said something very smart about Fe Se loop     They become obsessed with these friendships and connections    In some cases the ENFJ can even become rather manipulative in this loop  wanting to control their environment and maintain connections by any means possible     They will constantly seek validation from those around them  and from the outside world     by    can you look me in the eye and tell me this isn t the entire plot of Monika s act   and act      many in this comment section said that the character had an ENFJ mask       when it was nothing more than a high number of Se she used along the game  she was so obsessed with the player s validation and this connection with him that she made all her other friends look worse for her to be kinder in his eyes  how is that not put into consideration    monika s Ni is evident  especially towards the end of the game  but that doesn t mean it s her dominant one  and it s even unfair to assume that she would be INFJ in the final moment while throughout ALL the game she constantly demonstrates her extremely unhealthy Fe   Ni is introverted intuition  recognizing patterns and looking for meaning  but that doesn t mean being philosophical  anyone and everyone would also have a meaning to the game when it comes out that you are locked there  this is not a dominant Ni trait  so much so that when Sayori became aware of the game  she also became obsessive and followed the same path as Monika    plus you say she has Ni Ti looped  which doesn t make sense  because if she did  it would be characterized by a lack of concern for others  procrastination  isolation  and what makes the least sense  disconnect from reality      what matters most to her is reality  so much so that she gets caught up in that idea    Ni Ti loop on Monika would confirm that she would become a more critical human being with others  saying exactly what is right and what is wrong  which is just a lie    Monika is seen during situations of conflict extremely uncomfortable and wanting to resolve the situation  she does not try to use her Ti to say who is right and who is wrong and end  on the contrary  she assumes a vulnerable role by entering this environment  seeing the thing that matters most to her is weakening    i have a lot more to contradict the Ni Ti loop idea  because that s just separating   pieces of information from an entire game and ignoring the major details  using the argument that in the stories outside the main game and act three shows dominant Ni is just      because she does use Ni a lot at those times  but it doesn t take away the fact that Fe from her is still dominant  the problem in the comment section is that people are not realizing that ENFJ can relay in their Ni especially when your Fe dom is just so unhealthy and be philosophical  thinking about how meaningless is life is not a Ni trait  again   Monika is an ENFJ  with an unhealthy Fe  very early Ni developed  Se several times in loop situations linked to her malaise  and a lower Ti taking a key place in her situational stress and game manipulation ,enfj
Monika s Fe Se is her driving force in her original game         SPOILER ALERT        Monika realizes she lives in a video game and obsesses over the player because she wants to experience something real  something outside of her reality  Also  you can see Se in the quote   Sometimes  when you re writing a poem   or a story   your brain gets fixated on a specific point  If you try so hard to make it perfect  then you ll never make any progress  Just force yourself to get something down on the paper  and tidy it up later  Another way to think about it is this  if you keep your pen in the same spot for too long  you ll get a big dark puddle of ink  So move your hand  and go with the flow   INFJ Monika is a compelling idea  but I haven t seen any concrete arguments  Yes  she uses a lot of Ni  of course  she does  If Monica were an INFJ  I think she would be better at following through with her plan to kill the other girls  She constantly gives herself away because she wants to spend time with you  It doesn t make sense to me that she would force you to spend time with her decorating if her goal was to kill off the other girls  so you d have no other choice   Also  her actually realizing she s part of a videogame has nothing to do with her personality  so stop that   bonk ,enfj
Monika is not an INFJ  Being shy does not mean you are introverted  Being reflective does not mean you are introverted  Anyone can do both the actions of extroverts or introverts  It is just a preference to one way or the other  The system is a scale not black or white  ENFJs are not even known for being  hyper  extroverted   Monika s preference is towards the external world  Her friends  the player  the club   she s vastly different when compared to a true introvert  Yuri     She can be mistyped as an INFJ because she is unhealthy  Extroverts are known to lean towards introversion under stress or negative circumstances  It does not mean her natural preference has changed which is relevant in her motivations and actions   We may see different parts of her and we as humans have different aspects of our personality   but it doesn t change who we are at our core ,enfj
Why     and not      And why Sanguine  Dominant  Sanguine Choleric  She was incredibly ambitious  willful  and goal oriented  And calm limbic  ,enfj
monika is literally the most unhealthy ENFJ of all times  i m really confused why people are voting for INFJ    she has such a strong unhealthy Fe dom  that i could see all along the game  For example  in the end  when she said that she was able to sacrifice her own ending for the happiness of the player and the harmony in the club    i m shocked about how people are ignoring the plot of the whole game  monika knew the darkest secrets of everyone in literature club  by Fe  and used this ability to recognize what was fragile about the girls and manipulate them into doing what she using the information she got with Fe  For example when she talked with sayori about her depression   I thought Fe Ni was very clear  that s why i m so confused with the recent comments  Just because she is shy doesn t mean she s an introverted ,enfj
INFJ because of Mo Ni Ka  you may say that the Ni is aux bc the Ni is after Mo but there s no Mo function  therefore Nimoka bc of NI in NiFe ,enfj
This Comment section is again turning into a war of Fe dom slander and Ni supremacists     Please explain precisely WHY her Se is higher in her stack than Ti,enfj
yes  we get it  she uses Fe  she uses Ni  so can someone please give an explanation for Se that isn t just refuting INFJ  say what you want about eric s typing  but he gave a great explanation of what Ti is and he actually pointed it out in her interviews  even without his typing  i don t see much Se  and before anyone says it  no i don t think she uses Ti just bc she s smart  no i don t think social introversion   cognitive introversion  no i m not voting INFJ bc of  golden pairs   y all can read what i have to say about that below   and no i m not just voting INFJ because eric told me to  unfortunately  this page has been receiving a lot of weak arguments as of recently  but  not to sound arrogant  i promise you  i understand my functions  so i much rather have a civilized conversation about functions rather than some immature insult contest  alright  let s do this ,enfj
Obvious INFJ She s too introverted to be an ENFJ,enfj
I hear you all but her Ni Ti is superficial  For as annoyingly preachy as INFJs have a tendency to get  they do typically have a lot more substance going on in their preaching to be fair  a lot more structured thinking and concepts   ENFJs  on the other hand  have more trouble making very nuanced fundamental sense of concepts and explaining concepts in a very logical sense  Ni aux to Ti inferior   hence so many of them are great public speakers because of their charisma and not because they made up a very fancy elaborate way of saying a message while trying to understand it on    different levels  ENFJs basically go  live love laugh  with passion a lot of the times behind their driven causes   Zendaya is lovely but let s not pretend that she didn t rise so quickly because of her charisma and present awareness rather than anything very deep rooted like mentioned  You don t have to go further than actress Rooney Mara  popular INFJ example I think  to notice how much more dominant the Ni is in contemplating  theorizing and explaining concepts  especially noticeable during conversation with others and in interviews  Whereas an ENFJ is more presently focused due to Se tert and remain more on the surface of things which clearly works for other reasons  And then the obvious  the righteous social image obsession you only see in Fe doms   This is not to say she doesn t say smart things every now and then and what not  Any type can be smart and come off more introverted extroverted  so it just doesn t really speak much to type but rather her intellect and preferences within type   So yeah if she s an INFJ  then I m mf Gandhi  Hello  ,enfj
she wouldn t be se inferior   someone who s literally a fashion icon would have to have some se and care about appearances like that on some way  also def an fe dom imo,enfj

Instead of trying to keep or break the ties  we should probably try and focus on what she actually is  I think some people genuinely want to know  and typology related arguments get hard to find when there is so much unrelated commentary  We all pretty much agree that she uses Fe  Ni  Se  and Ti  so we could try and see if her Se or Ti is weaker as a start    GUYS I M SORRY I DIDN T SORT THE COMMENTS PROPERLY   ,enfj
I hate to be a buzzkill  but everyone who s playing this game of  breaking the tie   would please stop that  Like somebody else said in the comments  this site is made for typing  not for games and jokes  People come here to look and discuss about her personality  not to see comments like  I just voted to fix the tie eheheh    And even if  never take a joke too far  Cut it out ,enfj

Marinette is the most intense  expressive and clumsy character i ve ever meet  She cares intensely about people  but her insecurities and immaturities make her impulsive at times  When she is angry  sad  scared  and mostly happy  we can clearly see it  She is one of the people who most allows herself to feel  despite the lack of self esteem and the lack of excessive self confidence at times that make her hide that authenticity  When her feelings are out of balance  she can be very envious and do something that  if she were conscious  she would never do  What amazes me most about her is the sacrifice of her own personal life to save and help others often  she doesn t know how to say  no   and when she does  she feels bad about it  She also often makes others feel strong feelings  whether it is anger  sadness  confusion or love  that s because she sometimes doesn t notice her immersion in her own feelings  and with that she can say something that would easily affect someone without her noticing  She doesn t realize how good she is to people  how much she makes them laugh at her disasters or smile at her kindness  Deep down  she wants others to feel good despite everything  She is obsessed with defending morality  and doesn t think twice about defending a friend for an observed injustice  Your inner mind is creative  and that s why it s so easy to create something or define a plan that in our reality it would simply be almost impossible for anyone to think about it  because it s too comical and improbable  In her daily life  she is uncertain because of her feelings for Adrien  she has no confidence in herself  But when it comes to giving someone a hand  she totally step out of the chain and do what they can  without even realizing it  Her Fe is strong  and blending with Ni Ti subtly makes it look like she uses Te  Te uses others for her own benefit  and Marinette s air of confidence as a Ladybug mixed with her intelligence and need to stand up for what s  right  makes her look like a Te user  For her  there is a need to expose her own logic to Cat Noir because she needs to have a thinking mind to work out solutions and make her partnership work while her goal is to save others  Looking at the cognitive functions  i d say Marinette has Fe dom  for focusing too much on morality and how others are feeling  Well  she has her immaturity  insecurities and concerns like anyone else  and she has a lot to develop and understand   ,enfj
Ughh  I m sick of her character and I m so tired to hope for her character development because the show literally make her worst than ever  In s  she s such a massive stalker and then in s   she s a massive hypocrite    Dang  where on earth her character development go      I appreciate that she s not stalking Adrien that much but when she become a guardian  she becomes a hypocrite instead especially in Ephemeral when she said to Su han that she s a good guardian and all his decision was based on his fear and he didn t see their actions like whuttt     Her actions was also based on her fearss      My goodness please someone give me a sign that marinette will change    Anyway  she s  w  I believe ,enfj
want to beat this       up fr fr,enfj
I seriously hope one day her ennegram is changed to a  w  just because she wants adrien to love her doesn t make her a two have y all consider she could have a  w  in her tritype,enfj
Maybe she could be an ENTP  I see high Ne and Fe,enfj
I can see why people type her as a feeler  but just because she expresses feelings  does not necessary make her on  She follows her head and not her heart most of the time  even she said in one of the episodes  She wanted to show who she is to Chat Noir  but since it is dangerous  she doesn t  It is True that she makes plans based on her feelings of Adrien  but in a lot of situations  she needs to choose whether to follow her heart or head she alwyas choose the second  Everybody can be in love and obssessed  no matter their mbti type  I also say why I think she is intuitive  since a lot of people tend to vote her sensor  She thinks of possibilities and future plans  not only for Adrien  but in general  Just because she can make strange tools and stuffs efficent and useful  does not make her S,enfj
yall love to say  if she was a man yall wouldnt be defending her  but that s simply not true  joe goldberg has committed multiple crimes against women and ppl still think he s hot  nagito and kokichi have diehard stans even though they re borderline murderers  and creepypasta serial killers have their own fanbase  felix has stans even after what he tried to do to mari  there s a subculture of teen girls who are obsessed w   yandere  men  if she was a man yall would be saying  i wish he was that obsessed w me      but god forbid a teen girl who broke into her crush s house using superpowers has ppl defending her      yeah i don t support her behavior  i don t like what the writers have done with her character  and i am in no way coming for any stans of the characters i mentioned above  but the  if she was a man though     excuse is misogynistic and utter bs  men will ALWAYS be given more grace than women  especially women of color   anyways she s a  w ,enfj

Ok so since many people are debating whether she s     vs      I have decided to read both tritype descriptions and I must say she fits the     description a bit more than     in my opinion                                Enneagram tritype     archetype is a visionary who has a  critical eye  that sees what is lacking  what is original  and what has to change in any subject  arts  and activities that they re interested in  in order to produce something that is different  powerful  and meaningful to the world around them       archetype is compliant  withdrawn  and assertive in hornevian groups  Competent  reactive  and positive outlook in harmonic groups  Contrary to popular belief      archetype is balance and not as prone to moodiness similar to     archetype  This archetype is most common to INFPs and other Ne users however it is not unheard of that unusual MBTI and enneagram mix formed from this tritype along in     and     archetypes  All of these three tritype archetypes are  balanced  and relatable    sounds a lot more like her rather than this               Description  If you are the      you are intuitive  innovative and straight forward  You want to be original  inspirational and self possessed  A cutting edge tracker of both your internal and external worlds  you are an unconventional  passionate master of solutions  Outwardly  you are confident but inwardly you are emotionally vulnerable  Life Mission  Your life mission is to find truth and communicate your findings  A true messenger  you are happiest when you use your creativity to find compassionate ways to understand yourself and empower others  Blind Spot  You can be so focused on your opinions  insights and what is new and profound that your freedom seeking nature can come across as arrogant  resistant  and or uncooperative    like honestly she fits both ngl    but I see her more as a visionary person rather than a freedom seeking person,enfp
Being reckless is a   trait it has nothing to do with wing why is that even considered a valid argument  Also having w  w  doesn t mean you have the fears motive desire of   or   it literally doesn t work like that  You re gonna mistype everyone by voting this way bc it s virtually impossible to find a   that s concerned for their safety in   ways bc that s a   at that point ,enfp
 w  voters I get it that she s reckless and all but don t forget that  w  s are more grounded and realistic Hu Tao is not really grounded or realistic she s a pretty dreamy person can you at least show me voice lines of her being realistic or grounded     Instead of just voting her as a  w  just because she s reckless ,enfp
nefi user hu tao       WHERE are u guys seeing that  all i m seeing is how it stems from how much she sticks to her sense of judging right and wrong when it s been clearly stated that her take on how life and death are come from the things she was taught  that s not to say that all about her is clear indoctrination but it can be clearly sensed  here s where her healthy ti comes   instead of interpreting death as something necessarily bad  or limiting  or whatever negative adjective you can think of through subjective lens  she weights the cons and pros of death fairly  which is what makes her a fantastic funeral parlor director   here s mbti notes  take on healthy ti use with ne dom   Healthy Ti should serve to compensate for inferior Si by helping Ne to understand why it is important to think about possible consequences before taking action  rather than pursuing new possibilities haphazardly  When Ne can understand the benefits of taking time to accumulate accurate and precise knowledge  ENTPs will have more substantial self confidence because of possessing enough understanding to responsibly learn from any outcome or possibility  Ne should realize that making reflective decisions actually enhances the chances of discovering worthwhile ideas by imbuing them with more personal significance and interest  rather than assuming that careful reflection is restrictive or limiting in some way    and then some of her quotes to show you what i mean   Balance must be maintained  and yet destinies remain variable  Death has its own rules  and yet is still hard to predict  Remember   no matter where  no matter when  no matter what the reason   one should never poke fun at death  Only once you know and respect death can you truly understand the value of life    If I reach my full physical potential  then the next test is of the heart  It s largely thanks to you that I ve been able to step foot into this uncharted territory  It is here that heart and soul are as one like clouds  Death is a constant for all among the multitudes that sit beneath the heavens    shows her nonexistent fi  here comes the ti   The funeral tradition is like science  It cannot be performed based on impressions and personal habits    Apart from that  Hu Tao always instructs her undertakers to respect their clients  wishes and not insist on any particular form of funeral    Some clients want nothing more than a peaceful ceremony  some opt for a more lively style of event  There are also wealthier clients who would request a funeral arrangement of the most pompous kind  The services we provide have to be tailor made according to the clients  needs    shows more of a fe   besides  fe is her teritary function  which means she might not use it all that well but when she does  it s likely to be most apparent in her work  which clearly shows when you look at other characters  lines about her and how they can never seem to get along  yet she always gets compliments for how she does her job  you have to look deeply into her character  rather than just taking things at a surface level and calling it a day  also   w  because of how much of a jokester she is   Hu as in  Who put me in this coffin   and Tao as in  I can t geT OUt   Hehe    No  not funny    The Yuheng  Keqing    she s quite hard to talk to  She s so uptight  hehe    Really makes me wanna mess with her  She wouldn t knock me in the head with her sword though  right  Or would she       Xiangling s a riot  Only a little  boo  and she jumps  she s so easy to scare  Being in the industry that I am  I just love these kinds of people the most  Gotta keep it in check though  in case Guoba ends up toasting me instead    as well as her looking for looking even into the simplest joys  rationalizing away her negative feelings and striving to be happy in her own terms  too  that s what people must be mistaking for fi as well lol  that s about it lads let s get it,enfp
I would argue against her   fix because she is pretty into   ideals of structure   in her case  the  natural order  of life and death  She is stated to dislike characters who prolong their lifespan  Though she is a little afraid of death  she accepts it as an inevitability  An   fix  particularly one who is sp blind  would instead seek to grow powerful enough to  escape  death altogether  Childe being a good example of this  death only excites him and motivates him to grow stronger    She also uses violence as a means to an end  and doesn t take much enjoyment in it for the sake of it   w  or  w   but I m inclined to say she is     purely because of how seriously she takes certain traditions and structures within the funeral parlour     At last she came to the conclusion  her grandfather s absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he d arrived  to the place where he was bound  He had been open and honest in life  leaving behind no regrets  so was it right for his departure to be framed in regretful terms     She immediately consults her value system and finds peace in maintaining it  attaining her Vision not long after  Pretty Fi ish  but as Fi does not always concern ideas of good and bad  I think this is more a solid case of    which seeks to be just and fair   While Hu Tao is definitely an individualist  I wouldn t say she is grounded nor power hungry  She just    has a lot of fun being weird  Very   core  she is my wife thank you,enfp
i believe he s an ENFP im just here to say that when he shows the INFP results  the people who doesn t know about cognitive functions were soooo cringy with the  omg im INFP like taehyung     like my bias  and when you argument that mbti it s about cognitive functions  they say that actually they know that but it was clearly that not    i know that anyone borns knowing about a specif topic  but those things were incredible annoying,enfp

Hi  I read all     comments and there is no explanation to why he s sx      A lot of commenters argued for so    and then changed their mind cos now they have a vote for sx    I sometimes use BTS s profiles as guidelines as they have more comments and analysis  I think it d be nice if someone can bring to the table examples for sx    V profile is kinda set  imo  I think it ll be a good contribution  especially cos  s are not the easiest Enneagram to type    kinda off topic  but your help is very appreciated  in addition  I m trying to create an Enneagram index  meaning every subtype will have a kpop idol s  as reference  with a brief description of that subtype  You can write on my page if you have any ideas  it d be cool if you can tell me profiles which already have an explanation of the core type including IV ,enfp

From what I ve seen  many ne doms mistype themselves as introverts because they tend to fit the  rich inner world  introvert stereotype more than other extroverted types  se dom  ni si aux   Yeah  Taehyung has become more quiet and introspective lately  but he s still very much ne dom  Social extroversion isn t the same as extroverted functions  which is why you ll see a lot of ne doms with a few close friends rather than a large circle of acquaintances  wouldn t say that s necessarily the case with Taehyung  but my point still stands    His fi s just gotten a lot more prominent because of a  Auxiliary function development and b  Being in situations where he uses Fi more  I m pretty sure I ve seen people say this before  but you can see him get more and more  introverted  after BTS  popularity skyrocketed globally  around           I would say   which led to some speculation about him being depressed  Of course I m not going to speak for that because it s not my place to  and dxing idols as a fan is messed up on so many levels but I won t go into that   but I would argue that this has more to do with his Fi being put under stress  idk if that s the right phrasing    given the increased increasing amount of pressure for BTS to maintain public image  brand deals  remember the weverse Samsung post lmao   etc  I d think that the push against Fi authenticity with their current fame  NO HATE pls don t come at me I m not saying anything about the boys  just about the industry and        American reporters  kinda causes Taehyung to internalize his fi ideals rather than expressing them through his ne  He also has Fe critical parent  as compared to fe blind yoongi and fe opposing jungkook  the other four have fe in their stack   which is worth pointing out ,enfp
Honestly  I always viewed him as an INFP  Ever since he s grown out of his teen years I ve been seeing a lot of Fi and I think aux Ne sounds a lot like him ,enfp
hmm  i see that     and sluai is getting an uprise in votes because of the fact that taehyung is very kind and seems very mellow and laidback  however  i feel like he has an   fix rather than   and while he does seem to be in the middle with egocentric and agreeableness  he slightly leans towards the former    i understand that he s not a very intense person and his typology would make him seem intimidating and aggressive  i personally think sx so but ive read some rlly good arguments  but he doesn t have the willingness to preserve group harmony and what others feel rather than what he feels during certain situations      fix  he doesn t like it when things doesn t go his way or he feels like he s being controlled  he frequently calls out against sasaengs  shippers  and just weird delulu people  he also doesn t like it when he s forced to do things he doesn t want to  such as participating in interviews or stuff he doesn t like  and he makes it pretty evident  i remember during his birthday vlive  his staff didn t want him to leak his mixtape songs but he just looked into their eyes  laughed  and played a snippet  as a   core  i don t see his compliancy to keep the group harmony and listen to what others have to say  him being egocentric  obviously he s not an extreme case because if he is  then he would be very toxic  but he tends to have things go his way and not listen to what others say  i posted his personal motto from an army membership kit   i don t care who you are  i m doing things my way   which hints he s more egocentric   accommodating  i also remember when he wanted to cuddle with namjoon but namjoon didn t want to and he kept insisting until namjoon gave in  a person who s more accommodating would ve backed off but he s the type of person to persist until he gets what he wants  sometimes in a cute way     im not typing this way just to paint him as a very intimidating or dominant person  a person who has an   fix and is egocentric can be very kind  it s just that they say what s on their minds and care for themselves a bit more  take a look at chuu  an ENFP who has an   fix yet she is extremely kind  him having   in his tritype and being egocentric doesn t change the fact that he can be a sweetheart and very chill,enfp
ENFP     sx so  a person that has these types would be pretty cocky  arrogant  and kinda bratty or childish while om the inside feeling emotionally vulnerable  anyone care to explain  he seems like a very easy going and laidback person,enfp
this girl and his ex give major marianne  considering she is also an obvious ENFP  and willoughby vibes  just wanted to say,enfp
Yes she uses Se at times  but she uses Ne far more  All her impulsive decisions have to do with projecting her fantasies and imagination onto situations  instead of being grounded in the reality of what s happening   Just look at the lyrics from her song    I can t wait to meet everyone  What if I meet the one  Tonight imagine me gown and all Fetchingly draped against the wall The picture of sophisticated grace I suddenly see him standing there A beautiful stranger  tall and fair I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face But then we laugh and talk all evening Which is totally bizarre Nothing like the life I ve led so far For the first time in forever There ll be magic  there ll be fun For the first time in forever I could be noticed by someone And I know it is totally crazy To dream I d find romance But for the first time in forever At least I ve got a chance   She s imagining so many possibilities and getting overly excited by that  Her brain is a never ending  what if  and she almost has more fun imagining what will happen  She s so caught up in her ideas and fantasies that she is eventually able to get manipulated by Hans   A lot of ESFP voters seem to think that in order for someone to be an ENFP they have to be extremelyyy intuitive in a bubble of their own ideas and not be in the real world at all  But ENFPs can still engage in the real world and do sensory things  Anna clearly just uses high Ne   Like taking action  and doing things in the real world doesn t mean they are dom Se  Intuitives can go on quests to save their sister too  And her impulsivity with getting married was all from Ne Fi fantasization  not just Se   A lot of people get Ne and Se confused because they ultimately have the same goal  to experience things  It s just in different ways  Ne can want to experience the real world for the sake of fueling ideas but miss details and get caught up in fantasies  Se will want to experience the real world actually for the sake of it and exploring different sensations and activities  experimenting with their surroundings and fun stuff they can do ,enfp

You guys just need to compare her to Olaf and see the difference,enfp
why w  over w     w  makes more sense to me,enfp
Is it even legal to type Anna as ESFP ,enfp
I think the  w  votes are due to how energetic  bubbly  enthusiastic and optimistic she can be  which are definitely traits that correspond to Type  s    However  I d say she s a  w  fix over  w  core     w  should be heavily clear  Anna is the type that really wants to be needed and helpful towards other  and in the  st movie  she seemed like she had a big desire of wanting to be loved by others      Btw  why a   fix and not an   fix    Tbh  I always saw her Tritype Extension as     w     w     w    I can be convinced about the   fix  however ,enfp
i ve been trying to decide whether she s an ENFP or ESFP and i think i just realized something in the first movie  she uses a ton of ne  as seen in basically all of  for the first time in forever   but in the second movie  she uses more se than ne  which i think was especially apparent in the scene where she and olaf were on the ice canoe and she had to quickly assess her surroundings and stop them from getting killed lol so its possible that that s where some of the confusion on her type is coming from  that s just my opinion though  im not good at forming arguments so feel free to disagree with me   ,enfp
can y all explain to me why you think she uses Fi instead of Fe ,enfp
Enserio la est is votando ESFP   Decirme una sola canci n  escena o lo que sea en la que no est  usando Ne xd,enfp
doja is literally ESFP just wake up guys,enfp
People that wanna type Doja as a Ne dom are all stereotyping and have no proof of Ne  like when has she EVER been abstract   Like literally her focus is on the real and the physical  and theres nothing wrong with that  Ne doms are focused on concepts and ideas rather than the possibilities of the world around them  she is focused on the possibilities connected to reality ,enfp
I m not entirely sure about ENFP but so many of the ESFP arguments is that she dances  is visual with her music  sexual  etc   But that s her job and literal stage persona  On this site I ve noticed a trend where every ENFP is hit with ESFP votes because they do certain sensory stuff    Based on this website  ENFPs don t actually exist lol    Her thought process and actual personality seems way more Ne Fi to me ,enfp
Idk  ENFP made sense for me but i cant help but think that people are mostly voting her as Se dom just cause she is VERY sexual lmao   I vote her as a Se dom for her actions and reactions  she has a strong Fi also but i see more Se by the way she talks in interviews and even how she reacts when people insult or get negative about her or her work  EHEM  what happened with Fantano bye example   Her reactions are very Se focused on how fast she acts and responds without giving it too many spins  a Ne dom probably would be less impulsive or overreacting as she is and as a Fi Se user i can tell our reactions are a bit more aggresive  her being spontaneous isn t something Ne exclusive by watching her interviews and some situations she s been she seems more oriented to action than just talking ideas or keeping them for herself ,enfp
Screw it  starting up a new field of debate just to keep the hamster wheel that this page is turning at maximum speed  This would be almost troll like behviour on my part  but what if she was Non curious  her big rant on IG live about being burnt out seemed like stress caused by low openness  Also  she doesn t direct her own videos and performances  all the symbolic visual elements are someone else s idea  Oooor did that not occur to the cult following that praises any artist that diverges from the norm for being  creative  ,enfp
Another really tell tale sign that Doja Cat doesn t have Ne is the fact that she doesn t show any signs of Inferior Si  There s a certain dynamic between Se Ni and Ne Si that shows through no matter the case and I d like to highlight it here    ENFP Inferior Si usually entails them having unstable trains of thoughts  Not being able to reign in their Extroverted Intuition from pulling in so many ideas  Not being able to emulate the steadiness and consistency that Si users are known for  This also manifests as a disgust for conventionalism  which is a certified ENFP characteristic      Examples of ENFP Inferior Si   Oscar Wilde   Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative     Aldous Huxley   Consistency is contrary to nature  contrary to life      Hunter S Thompson   I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine to five hours     Osho   Ordinary society is like a paperweight on you  It won t allow you to fly     Salvador Dali   I think that the sweetest freedom for a man on earth consists in being able to live  if he likes  without having the need to work     Jennifer Aniston   It gets so boring to do the same thing over and over    Now here I posit that Doja shows more signs of Inferior Ni  Courtesy of Dominant Se  this usually means they are often unconcerned with matters that don t concern the physical realm  It s either to do something  or you don t  You enjoy the present  or you don t  There s nothing metaphysical to concern yourself with unless you want to suck the joy out of your life  This sort of thinking most definitely reflects Doja s thought process  It s all a matter of a factly and does not show any resemblance to an ENFPs cognition       Examples of ESFP Inferior Ni and Dominant Se    Mark Cuban    I want to  help you to reach your goals and have more fun in your life      Recurring theme of  fun  for ESFP     Tony Robbins   Live with passion      Katy Perty   I never want to be boring  so therefore I aspire to always be interesting  experimental and entertaining      Justin Bieber   I want my world to be fun  No parents  no rules  no nothing     Mel Gibson   You can drown in a mire of worry     but it doesn t pay  because tomorrow always takes care of itself     Inferior Ni  ESFP tendency to keep everything simplistic  even speech  carries through with Doja as well  Mads Mikkelson exemplifies this sort of thinking    I try to eliminate words as much as possible  There is a tendency to underestimate the power of what we can do without words  Sometimes you can make  things  more powerful and precise without dialogue       DOJA S QUOTES      I mean its cool that people appreciate fun stuff     ESFP s  straight forward demeanor   as coined by IDRLabs      I just like to do the fun stuff  If I m not having fun with it  I m not going to do it for the rest of my life     Very reminiscent of an ESFP s tendency to seize the day  and live life to the fullest      That s a small portion of my career  taking a moment to do something stupid     Inferior Ni      I am whatever you want me to be and I can t control that  My experience is my experience       Inferior Ni      At this point  I just do whatever    I want  to my detriment         Inferior Ni  Quoting from IDRLabs  again       ESFPs  are keenly aware of their surroundings and are able to quickly identify and advantageously react to novel stimuli      They are often able to sense and respond to people s emotions in the moment  even if nothing was ever said or done to express such emotions    Now compare with Doja    I really pull from everyone  I m absorbent    I ve tried but there is little to no evidence that she s Ne Dominant  I haven t seen anything that could compare to how blatantly Se her quotes are ,enfp
The simple fact that her artistical name is doja cat   doja   a different name for w  d    cat bc she likes cats  is enough explanation on why she is a Ne dom    Guess what  Ne doms can also be s xual if they whant to  Doja is definitely a Ne dom and i will die on this,enfp
https   youtu be Zl CSkh mbw t     Single observer  she engages with what she has at the moment  She just does things  not knowing what to do with what she can do which is an Se Ni kind of thing  Suppression of personal direction  inferior Ni    https   youtu be Z    GXXefU t     it takes her   hours to get the GENERAL idea of the song  Because she is an Ni user  regardless if it is Inferior  it still in her four stacks of preference   She would synthesize her thoughts onto one theme      She created the song moo because of the random sensory that she bumped into  chaos function  gathering function     She said she has no affinity to cows whatsoever  So Si shadow   Ti Fe axis very concerned with the audiences however with her Ti auxiliary she still shared her what worked for her      its messy  she does this things because its reasonable enough  She knows how to create music  Despite not making it very effective  Te shadow  because  people liked what I was doing  which is Fe tertiary she does what she does    no Ne on this girl ,enfp

Just by using common sense it should be clear that social is impossible to be her leading instinct  She was disconnected from society for too long   She is Seen to develop her social instinct  And even by the subtype descriptions she simply can t be a social    Social   maybe but Social   absolutely not,enfp
TOTAL Ne dom  can t see any Se at all  or well maybe something slightly more Se is the way she approaches her goal  just kinda running into it  But other than that  the Ne is too obvious  She s just like Ariel   I have a lot right now  but I want something else    She also shows Fi aux through her journey  She like has a switch that turns off and on  Like her singing when she s about to touch grass  Should I  No    Here I go   And afterwards she s literally having the best time of her life swaying around in trees  but then seen crying and caves  then running around again  then crying on the grass  such a mood honestly  as an Fi aux  But she also has so many different kind of solutions for getting out of bad situations  and when one solution isn t obvious  she ll look somewhere else to find that solution  There you go  Rapunzel is an ENFP ,enfp
saw her typed as an ESFJ somewhere and was relieved the consensus isn t that  ,enfp
I hope they don t change Rapunzel to ESFP as they are doing with other ENFP S   ,enfp
creo que es evidente que Rapunzel es una ENFP en todo su esplendor  adem s de ser una  w   los argumentos de  un   saldr a de la torre  son un poco escuetos  Bro  yo soy ENFP  w  igual que ella y  aunque est  encerrada porque mis padres son estrictos  no me hace querer romper todo y salir  aunque a veces sue o        sobre viajar e irme y explorar  No tiene nada que ver si est  o no en la torre para definir si es un   o no lo es ,enfp
I think Rapunzel is definitely an Se dom   ESFP for that matter  more than ne dom  And tbh yes I can see why people might think she is an ENFP  Even I used to type myself as ne dom before I actually came to conclusion I m an se dom  This two cognitive functions might actually seem a lot more similar than some people realise  Especially if you point out the fact that there are different types of ne doms and different types of se doms  Ne dom is fully capable of being more down to earth and there is a possibility of se dom being a dreamer  So argument like    no se dom would ever waste so much time dreaming of things   are just plain stereotyping  Every cognitive function can dream  and do it as much as they can  Especially if you look at Rapunzel  s life where she was isolated  locked in a tower and manipulated by someone who she thought was her mother  It s only natural for her after spending so much time in the tower alone  to develop some kind of escape in a mental stimulation   However the things that do take this types apart are the way they make decisions  view the world   Ne doms tend to make descions by making connections and engaging in external world with their minds  They are the types of people that see a lot of possibilities  can play with different unrelated patterns and make descions based on that  Se doms make descions based on engaging themselves in the external world  Often making decisions in a spite of the moment  They rather go with the flow and don t think too much of different possibilities   Ne doms tend to view the world as boundless possibility of exploring nes ideas  And they often tend to get energized by generating new concepts and ideas   While se doms tend to look at life as an amusement park  with different things they can experience in the outside world    And I think both of the descriptions of se dom suit Rapunzel much better  For example she wants to see the latterns  but what for  To experience new stuff  to make herself see  touch  smell  taste something different  She doesn t care about stimulation of her    mental world     but is much more focused on just being able to fully enjoy the present moment  Rapunzel aswell tends to make descions much more like a se dom  She is quick to do something by analysing the external world  and going with the flow  She doesn t focus too much on what might be or tyring to connect all the new sensory experience that are happening to her  she just takes it in ,enfp
i don t see any   in rapunzel at all btw  she definitely seems like a   fix       fix  and i don t see double withdrawn in her   ,enfp

I haven t played the game in years  but how s she a social two  when some of their traits are being ambitious and more introverted than other twos  she s probably a nine  but even if she is a two  she s probably an selfpreservation two,enfp
okay she s      a social    but she has   and   in her  tritype   i just don t know whether she s a     or    ,enfp
Always knew there was something off about her being a two  her main sin isn t pride at all  Instead  it s sloth in her case     I ve had really bad depression my whole life  Did you know that  Why do you think I m late to school every day  Because most days  I can t even find a reason to get out of bed  What reason is there to do anything when I fully now how worthless I am  Why go to school  Why eat  Why make friends  Why make other people put their energy and caring to waste by having them spend it on me  That s what it feels like  And that s why I just want to make everyone happy    Without anyone worrying about me       Yeah   Anyways I relate to her sm as a fellow social   it hurts  ,enfp
melancholic doesn t mean depressed  when was she logical  perfectionistic  or organized ,enfp
I m glad more ppl are voting her as a   now  she s such a social   it hurts,enfp
The most   character I ve seen,enfp
 s often like to think of themselves as helpful  in Sayoris case she doesn t think she deserves to be loved but wants to be loved  if that s not a   then nothing is  she isn t exactly carefree since her depression and everything she says about that makes it easier to notice ,enfp
I have a feeling she s a social   instead of a social   I m probably biased because I really relate to her but I told myself I wasn t going to be biased so I m going to trust myself and say she s a social   instead  Someone please correct me if I m wrong  ,enfp
she is most def a social    not a social    even if she is a    she would be an sp   not a so   yall need to stop typing all the outgoing helpful girls who put others needs before their own as so w s   it s getting old and typing every helpful person as an so w  is very shallow ,enfp
sayori is such a social      Social Nines express the passion of psychological laziness  or sloth  through merging with the group  working hard in support of group interests  and prioritizing the group s needs above their own  Social Nines are congenial characters with a need to feel like they re a part of things a need that expresses an underlying feeling of being different or not fitting in with the group or community  This person is a light hearted  sociable  fun loving character who expresses a driving need to be involved in the group     They energetically demonstrate friendliness and sociability  they don t show their pain  they don t burden others  and they don t show people how much energy it takes to devote so much effort to the community  These are people who are generous and unselfish  mindful of the group  and gifted in meeting the needs of others to the point where they sacrifice themselves to satisfy the responsibility others want to put on them     Social Nines are extroverted  expressive  and forceful  and so they go against the inertia typical of Type Nine in some ways but on the inside they still have a sense of laziness about their own needs and wants    here s the complete description of the so  subtype     you can also check this on comment ,enfp

changing my vote to social seven and sexual two   so  w    sx  w    so  w     the social subtype itself fits better  michael thinks as a group and values his community above all else     this fits him perfectly   social seven counter acts their gluttony by sharing with others  the things they desire  mistypes as a two often  which a lot of ppl are doing     sx  w  can look like a three  seeks praise and approval  seeks intense bonds and love  fixated on individuals    social nine  countertype  social  leader like  they search for where they stand in groups  and really push to get involved and fight slothfulness  they have the most desire to fit in  compared to the two other nine subtypes ,enfp
i totally get why socionics Ni doesn t fit him but his Si is also atrocious  he probably isn t logical either so there s only one option    He is IEE   Ne is probably Michael s highest value   one of Michael s biggest strengths as a manager is the ability to keep his clients interested in the new directions  high Ne  and close to him  High Fi   he does have strong Fe but it s not valued as Michael prefers his views on bonds to exceed group interests  notice how often his view on  friendship  causes others to disagree with his logic causing everyone to feel he doesn t understand the group  valued creative Fi destroying Ti   his Ti is polr  not suggestive   He s not ESE because he has no Si  very little  He rarely cares about the comfort of his environment and has very odd preferences for his own comfort that has been built through his past experiences  low valued Si   also I find it hard to justify such a clear  F with high Si  especially for a type like ESE that s always sharing the physical world with others,enfp

I can definitely see why Michael has been voted as a    but in my opinion his traits resembling   are just too prominent and obvious to be ignored  Even his personality traits listed on Dunderpedia are exemplars of his prideful nature as a       Michael s constant desire to be the center of attention often manifests itself in selfish behavior  For example  when he burns his foot in  The Injury   he expects Pam and Ryan to tend to his needs  despite Dwight s much more serious concussion  When invited to Phyllis  Wedding  he assumes his participation will be the high point of the ceremony  He pouts when he is upstaged by Phyllis  elderly father  eventually giving an insulting and overly familiar toast that gets him banned from the reception altogether  His desire to be liked often leads him to make unwise decisions or unfeasible promises without considering the consequences  only to back out when they result in an undesirable comeuppance  Michael appears to emphasize moments of sympathy or civility directed at him by his coworkers  mostly Jim  and inflates their importance in order to compensate for his loneliness     Apart from his masterful salesmanship  Michael is lacking in almost any other skills  management or otherwise  Jim Halpert once made a color graph of how Michael spends his time      distracting others      procrastination  and    critical thinking  Jim added that he inflated the  critical thinking  percentage so people could actually see it on the graph  His laid back approach more often results in lower than expected workplace productivity  particularly when Michael places personal interests as a priority over work  such as his birthday  someone else s birthday  or his various seminars   To avoid being disciplined for his foolish actions  Michael often resorts to scapegoating employees to cover himself  Although his actions often lead to more problems for his employees  Michael believes that Scranton is  the cool  fun branch    like Animal House   He is genuinely upset when the top salesman from the Utica office trashes Scranton in a phone call by saying it s  worse than Camden     All of that came from Dunderpedia  and this acts as a great example of certain aspects of type    which are summarised by Naranjo as follows    Ennea type II  in this Fourth Way characterology is one that I have characterized through the paradox of an egocentric generosity and corresponds to the histrionic personality of DSM III  Representative individuals are usually hedonistic  lighthearted and rebellious in the face of anything rigid or restrictions on their freedom  Early in the life of my first group in Berkeley a student  Dr  Larry Efron  summarized the characters in a collage of caricatures from William Steig  which he gave me on occasion of a birthday party  In the collage of Steig s caricatures  type II is represented by a clownish figure that contrasts with the struggling mountain climber that represents the hardworking and obsessional type I    Trait structure     Pride   Love Need   Hedonism   Seductiveness   Assertiveness   Nurturance and False Abundance   Histrionism   Impressionable Emotionality  Most of the traits listed above can be seen in the aforementioned description of Michael s character  His love need can be seen in his motivation for being a salesman to make loads of friends  and his need to continue trying to make friends while in a leadership position  His pride and assertiveness is observed in the numerous accounts of Michael trying to make himself the centre of attention  such as when he wanted his burnt foot attended to over Dwight s concussion  His hedonism can be seen in his anger towards any figure who holds authority above him  most notably Toby  who he sees as being restrictive upon his freedom and making the office boring    I could keep going  but you get the point  Michael Scott is a very obvious example of a    His need for constant attention and love  his hate towards authority and restriction on freedom  and his clownish behaviour within the office make him an exemplar of the prideful and vain personality on point   ,enfp
      Pleasant  takes things lightly  Considerate  Easy going  Comforting  soft  but there s still a high emphasis on achievements  Avoids stirring up drama and instead constantly looks at the positives  sometimes going out of their way to avoid acknowledging the negatives  People person even though they can seem pretty quiet  Thoughtful  watches from behind the scenes and in this way  learns how to gain recognition as well  ,enfp
this guy has more Ne than the definition of Ne,enfp
 Correct me if you want  I am open to learning more about typology    ENNEAGRAM VARIANT  The important thing to note in  The Office  is how we explore the challenges of a tormented boss who seeks to be recognized  because of traumas he has had  and in a quest more than sure  we will realize what that dynamic is like with employees who just want to do their jobs  In short  the description that we can assimilate to the series is  the search of a boss for happiness and recognition that he hardly had or will have  Just knowing this  we can judge that Michael Scott is on an unhealthy mood   on his enneagram  We then realize that Michael is someone who is very concerned about participating in occasions where he can dissipate his energy and talent  leaving his anxiety only to prove himself in some way to his employees  leaving him in shameful and destructive scenarios  Also  because of his lack of prudence and judgment  he gets into dangerous relationships just to be able to provide pleasure and recognition for himself somehow  leaving him to get involved with harsh and restrictive people  And if you haven t noticed yet  all of the above is the perfect description of an unhealthy so sx  He is absurdly patronizing  always wanting to highlight his good deeds to prove how generous he is   which generates the most hilarious moments  especially with Stanley and Oscar s homosexuality  However  he is not so nice that he will cover up the wrongdoing of those on his side for the sake of power   if that were the case  he would not have made Dwight urinate in a pot in a drug test in Drug Testing so that they would not find out that Michael himself smoked pot  Likewise  he inherits characteristics of an unhealthy  sx  he prowls around the object of his passion excessively and makes nasty comments to make them  comfortable  with him or acts obsessively on them to get their attention   just like he does with Holly and AJ  However  he does not demand overprotection of himself for his companions or cling to grotesque interrogations compulsively  Anyway  I see in Michael the predominant characteristics of a very unhealthy  so even more than of a  sx  albeit a very strong one  We see little of his romances   there s only really any depth in Holly s   and the series is more concerned with telling about the daily life at Dunder Mifflin and how Michael deals with the social void ,enfp

His interactions are motivated by the desire to get attention validation and be accepted by others  Unhealthy    His ENFP vide makes him seem like a    but   is not his core motivation,enfp

There are so many misconceptions about the Functions on here  so I thought it would be best if I shed some light  Jung says that the psychological functions orient themselves in the field of what he calls Ectopsyche  The ectopsyche is a system of relationships between the conscious contents of our psyche and information from the world around us  facts and data that stream into us through the functions of Sensation  The first irrational function  Sensation  tells us that a thing is  it does not tell us what it is and it does not say anything else about the object in question  it just conveys to us that something is  that this object exists  Thinking tells us what a thing is  and feeling tells us what that thing is worth  Whilst the other irrational function  Intuition  is not concerned with the thing as it is in the present at all  only its transformation through time  If something exists  then Intuition sees it transforming into something else   The Irrational Types are primarily influenced by their perceptions  In the case of the Intuitive Type  they gleam over the object ignoring the details and perceive an image of the whole which does not exist and seems to have been projected from the future and into their consciousness  They strive towards changing the reality of the object  transforming it into their perception of the possibilities inherent in it  Consequently  if they succeed  then they lose interest in the object  because the possibility has been fulfilled and has now become reality  Intuition does not care for reality  On the other hand  types dominated by Sensation are obsessed with reality and are quite content with exploring the details of the object to their fullest extent  For them  a thing is True once it is real  To illustrate  If we imagine a field  then the Intuitive type is the one who plows the field and moves on to the next field before the harvest is even finished  Whilst the Sensation Type wants to stay in the realm of reality and admires the field   it is completely immersed in the reality of the object  The Sensation type becomes sick if they re not within the four walls of reality  whilst the Intuitive views the walls as a prison and wants to explore the possibilities    So if we assume that Naruto is an Irrational Type  we could quickly distinguish whether he s influenced by Intuition or Sensation  This should not be very difficult because they re polar opposites and repress one another  so one would be very underdeveloped and quite primitive  All we have to ask ourselves is  Does he constantly seek change or is he content with any situation at hand  Does he aim to finish  or is he moving from one unfinished product to the next  I personally think that the answer is quite obvious   Note  I m not mentioning the attitudes  just giving the general description of the Functions and Irrational Types so that we can quickly recognize the dominating and inferior functions ,enfp
Reposting replies I made about Naruto being ESFP    In his general behavior Naruto uses Se not Ne  Except in battle  Naruto never thinks he doesn t like to think   Naruto in his free time   trains  eats  makes pranks  asks dates to Sakura  Even more  during his training   https   xfs     mpcdn net       images  b b   bb  cdeec  b f db  c  b  c     e f                      jpg acc KLxUzlQOaE VhUXLorgFcA exp             Typical Se dom  Naruto learns things from physical sensations ,enfp
I see both Ne and Se in naruto  and im kinda split on him  You can make a good argument for both Dom Se and Dom Ne  as both fit for naruto as a character  However there is one issue I have with ESFP  and that s the fact that I see naruto developing his Si as the series goes on  ENFPs often times directly oppose their Si  as it often times goes against their Ne  However  if an ENFP develops their Si and becomes healthy  they can learn to use their Si to support their other functions  which is what I see naruto doing throughout the series   Naruto throughout Part   and early shippuden was actively rejecting the past  He wanted to actively move on and go towards the future  which you could argue is inferior Ni  However  naruto throughout late Shippuden and boruto actively take and learn from the past  One line in particular  really emphasized on this  and this also shows the contrast between Sasuke and naruto  as Sasuke was constantly trying to abandon and cut off the past using Ni  as he believed that the past only made mistakes  and that the past need to be abandoned  and cut off  Which is what convinced me on Sasuke being INTJ  But naruto here  says something that kinda made me think that he has Si   Itachi    is now in my past  I will sunder all past mistakes and doubts here  and bring about reform    Beginning with cutting you down  Yours will be the last blood i shed    In the memory of my late brother    Sasuke INTJ    I won t let you   I learned everything I know from the people of the past  Especially about how to figure out what to do after making a mistake    Naruto This comes off as Developed Si  and I don t really see Ni  I m not going to vote naruto ENFP yet  but I do ask ESFP voters for inferior Ni  I can see inferior Ni  however I m leaning towards ENFP as of now  Of course  I m not set in stone with naruto  so if you have any inferior Ni arguments  I would like to know ,enfp
At first I thought he was also a Se dom  but now I think he s actually an Ne dom and here s why   Se and Ne have a lot in common in that they are both easily distracted and go from one experience idea to the next  The Se s decision to reverse direction is self evident  They ve had their fill of a real life encounter  But  as we can see from Naruto s Ninjitsu training  the Ne is picky  Ne is more interested in possibilities and ideals than in reality  ENPs like Naruto become tired with a concept before putting it into action  They go on to the next activity before anyone realizes how they may feel bored without accomplishing anything  It s why learning Ninjitsu has been so difficult for him as he s gotten older  Physicality isn t something that comes naturally to him since his mind travels with Ne  Before putting the first lesson into practice  he goes on to something more engaging   Some of you guys are saying that he is an Ni user just because he as a vision of being a hokage  but that isn t how it quite works  Inferior Ni aids the ESP in seeing that their own experiences may be viewed in a variety of ways and aren t compatible with everyone  It aids the Se dom in comprehending different ideas that are at odds with the Se dom s unique experiences and way of life  Other opinions and interpretations are seen as a threat to the Ni s sense of self generated by their experiences if the Ni is underdeveloped   As for the inferior function  it s hard to describe inferior functions in a lot of characters from Naruto since almost everyone is weirdly good with their inferior function    Ttake Sasuke  an INTJ  for example  You expect him to be clumsy or any other low se stereotype but it s like he s naturally good at using Se  except when he is constantly destroying himself and can get unreasonably impulsive or aggressive  tunnel visioning through things without a second thought when stressed or have no other choice    Naruto is oblivious to the need of adhering to older ideals shaped by prior experiences  He considers outdated rules to be stifling  This is the Ne Si struggle throughout his life  If something doesn t work  you go on to something else  according to his Ne  He overlooks the importance of recognizing and honoring particular needs and principles in all settings  It s why he doesn t understand a lot of the Ninja world s difficulties  Naruto isn t very interested in the meaning and views derived from personal experience and rooted in history  Simply changing and adapting is his style  Naruto s journey is driven by his coming to grips with the old and the new  He won t be able to recognize himself as Hokage until the issue is settled   Plus Naruto be coming up with the most unconventional methods of fighting  He may be a ninja but he certainly doesn t fight like one ,enfp
I see Ne dom  but Se is understandable  This is like Mellos page  when a Ne dom is Se dom in socionics  that will produce great confusion  That s a very rare and narely combo  Your essentially using abstract   creative ideas and possibilities MBTI Ne  while simultaneously being driven by force  willpower and action Socionics Se     ENFP in MBTI and ESFP in socionics is my take    Also could someone explain   fix   Sanguine dom  I agree he wants peace  but he seems to reactive and comfortable expressing anger for a   and a sang dom  he s a little too results driven    He seemed more       Sanguine Choleric  but willing to have my mind changed,enfp
i think people vote for ENFP and ESFP forgot that ENFP has SE as weakest function   th  and ESFP has NE as weakest function and NI inferior  really naruto looks very FE NI with tertiary SE and inferior TI impossible he being ESFP or ENFP makes much more ENFJ sense to me,enfp
To be honest  I feel as though young Naruto back in part   seemed to be more of an ESFP based on his initial characterization  but as the story went on  he began to show more idealistic traits and came to resemble an ENFP  I personally feel his enneagram would be  w  rather than  w  however due to his altruistic nature and motivation to gain love and acceptance  although he does show a lot of traits of enneagram   as well in his drive for success and achievement  I think this became most evident through the boruto series  Naruto has a definite   fix for sure in his fun loving and optimistic nature and shows this side to his personality in the way he confronts setbacks  As for his wife Hinata  she seemed INFP ish back in Part    but ironically became more of an ISFJ from shippuden onward  which can probably be attributed to poor writing ,enfp
Honestly its pretty hard for me to decide  He shows a lot of Ne but also alot of Se,enfp
In the series  Naruto is clearly displayed as an ENFP  This is represented in situations when he is either fighting or being talked to    First  when Naruto is pinned to the ground by Pain  he is angered because Pain says that it justifies the means of torture and terrorizing villages when the ends prove an everlasting peace   What I want is to create peace and bring about justice   Pain says  However  Naruto soon calm downs and actually becomes sad when Pain describes how the other villages destroyed his   What about my family  My friends   My village  They suffer the same fate as this village at the hands of you Hidden Leaf ninja  How is it fair to let only you people preach about peace and justice  Once the land of fire and the Hidden Leaf had grown too big  To protect their national interests  They forced feudal clans to wage war against each other  And profited from it  Otherwise the people of the villages would have starved  As it happened  Our little nation and its villages became the battlefield where the great nations waged their war   Pain says  After which  Naruto displays his Fe when he actually seems to have remorse for Pain instead of not caring simply because he s the enemy  This is absolutely indicative of Naruto being an ENFP  E  He would always rather talk than listen throughout the series  N  He focuses on how things might affect people in the future rather than doing things immediately without thinking about the future  F  He feels for Pain s situation rather than not caring simply because he s the enemy who destroyed the entire village  P  He never stuck to his word  He made a promise and let down the person because something presented itself that was suddenly so important that he stopped caring  Now  if you still think he is anything other than an ENFP  you are either mentally ill or you are genuinely too used to listening to dogma that makes absolutely no sense ,enfp
It s possible to think that in his child version he is an ENFP and in his adult one he is an ESFP    He became much more focused on direct methods for solving conflicts  when as a child he used lateral thinking to come up with innovative forms of doing things  him using his clones to do the rasengan for the first time  for example ,enfp
It s been ages since I watched Naruto  but I remember he used Si to learn Rasengan  Si is subjective sensorial impressions and detail oriented ,enfp
I m pretty confused whether or not Naruto is an ESFP or ENFP  due to both convincing ENFP and ESFP comments   But here is my analysis    ESFP voters often use evidence before he became Hokage from his teenage years  Some forget immature ENFPs tend to act like ESFPs  impatient  reckless     Majority of evidence that Naruto is an Se dom comes battles  which requires most people to have fast reflexes and make quick decisions  What about his everyday life decision making  Is there any Se in that   I m just trying to point out places where Se dom evidence is vague  but ESFP is still a huge possibility ,enfp
can someone explain why Fi ,enfp
                                                                                                                                       ,enfp
                   ESFP                                                          INTJ            ESFP            ,enfp
ESFP ppl give me a better explanation  i m really leaning towards ENFP right now,enfp
We must stop idealizing all the protagonists or  happy  characters as ESFP  Naruto is a legitimate ENFP if we see his cognitive functions well  he fits perfectly as ENFP and that s it,enfp
The bias omg  I m sorry but I can t see this as anything as bias  Whether it s because of shipping or because people want Naruto to be a special different shonen protagonist idk   ESFP can be as unpredictable as ENFP  and also idealist  Every shonen protagonist are idealist and sometimes unpredictable ex  Luffy  but they re still ESFP    Naruto hates thinking  his  ideas  or craziness are always based on physical things  Naruto is never overflowed with thoughts or ideas  He s simple minded and like things simple  Having a dream doesn t make him a daydreamer like ENFP usually are because they have too much ideas   on the contrary his dream is very Ni inf and Se dom  He has a single idea and use his Se thought training to make it happens without thinking about anything else ,enfp
I think it looks like Se because Ne is a very  very fast decision making progress  Kind of seeing everything weave together in an instant and reaching a fast conclusion  That is why Ne doms can also immediatly and intuitively react  which can look like Se  Ne is just really fast too  Also he understands abstract matters  and that also really fast  intuitively   He sees himself in a bright future  everything is possible to Ne  too  Idk how he could be Se tbh haha,enfp
I think at this point tha he use his Ne and his Se very well,enfp
You know what naruto will say seeing all you guys fight over his type    Listen guys  Y all can do what I did  Y all can be a hokage too  Just give your best shot at everything  Dattebayo   Now lets have some Ichiraku Ramen  together  shall we   ,enfp
I think ENFP suits him well honestly  He s a visionary  Ne  who dreamt about being hokage and making sure the shinobi world is at  peace   He s an achiever but he s achievement are mostly focused on helping people   w  ,enfp
Im rewatching the series right now and I can actually see why some people vote Naruto as an Ne dom due to his prankster  crafty and idealistic nature  On the other hand in shippuuden he is using much more Se than in his OG version  It is a well known fact that a personality type cant change but this is a fictional character we are talking about  I guess in some cases the personality of a fictional character might seem inconsistent due to author wanting to show some other sides of a character   So I would type the kid Naruto as an ENFP and the adult Naruto as an ESFP  Im open to debate ,enfp
One of the most obvious ESFPs in fiction IMO  You don t have to be an NF to be idealistic ,enfp
Oh yeah  the character that screams   I WANT TO BE HOKAGE  HOKAGE  HOKAGE    since episode one and never envisions himself as anything else must be a Ne dom and not a clear Ni inf    Naruto is so grounded in the present and apart from abstract concepts that all he does is spam rasengans and base his strategies on the perception of his surroundings during the entire show ,enfp
He reminds me of Asta  Black Clover  and Luffy  One Piece   They have big dreams  and they are action oriented  Listen  when I watched Naruto  I ve always annoyed because he s not logical and doesn t like to think twice  as opposed to myself  a  w    His apparent function is Fi  of course  However  regarding Se and Ne  I m not sure he s Ne dom  because he s very in tune with his surroundings  If you ve ever watched the first Naruto movie  which is set in the Snow Village   you ll remember that Naruto liked the movies he watched because the actress was beautiful and brave  with more attention to visuals   but in reality she was arrogant  And if you ve watched the time he met Jiraiya  it s obvious that he didn t catch Jiraiya s intention at first about learning the rasengan  This was how he started to develop his inferior Ni and figure it out for himself  However  most of his behavior in imitating the teachings of his teacher is Se Te  not Ne Te  Heck  even all the speeches that are given to the enemy  talk no jutsu  are also how one must escape from his past and live a new life today  Doesn t that show that his Se is very high  If he is an ENFP  he will talk a lot about potential  But Naruto didn t  he focused on the current state and encouraged his enemies to do the same  He believed that his enemy could change as shown by his Fi  just as he believed that Sasuke would return  Oh yeah  if Naruto was an ENFP  he would definitely relate to Shikamaru as a fellow Ne user  because Shikamaru planned a lot  Naruto  No  He just jumped into action without thinking  Usually he thinks about it at the end after the action is less successful or while doing something ,enfp
To test out my theories  since I claimed Naruto as an Ne dom in my previous comment thread where I ve given many specific examples  I decided to reread the manga  and for the most part in battle Naruto displays very linear thought processes  even handicaps make him more excited for battle   Naruto takes action before he thinks of consequences  however he s also shown out of the box perception which makes him come up with strange solutions and applications  This makes him both extremely predictable and unpredictable at the same time  His Ne tends to jump out when faced with novelty  often getting him excited about cool possibilities and becomes extremely inquisitive  Also there are times in battle he uses it when trying to perceive an enemy attack   genjutsu  ninjutsu  which is it  or  if we do this  then this   weighing possibilities while Sasuke easily comes up with a conclusion  Naruto s actions seem linear but his perception  when written down in dialogue  is completely scattered  A big part of his fighting style also seems to be the use of diversions and trickery when blasting through doesn t work   Also people keep saying Naruto s willpower is his Se  however kakashi said during Sakura vs ino that  Naruto and Sakura are the same in their innability to accept defeat  and Sakura is an ESFJ  Fe Si user   Also during the kiba vs Naruto fight  Naruto uses a lot of that trickster creativity commonly associated with Ne to subvert expectations  Kakashi says  the creativity of a former prankster  to describe what he sees  But Naruto also lacks the skepticism or doubt that might come with Ne  and he is extremely gullible and takes things at face value   People here tend to attribute Ne to the theoretical  and while that is somewhat true  I think people shouldn t underestimate Ti blind spots  In science for example  the best theorists have Ti working with Ne  think Einstein with relativity   scientists with Ni Te work towards absolutist thought process  think Newton s laws of motion or absolute space and time   Naruto s Ti is his weakest function out of all  and his Te tends to make him results oriented  The Ti Ne users of the show  namely Shikamaru and Kakashi  are able to see and deconstruct events and strategies  which is why they are often used to convey info to the readers   Inferior Si makes a lot of sense to me rather than it being a demon function  while memories connecting to his Fi come up a lot  he has poor memory database for detail and overlooks certain events  However in times of stress  memories seem to seep into his conscious and give him new motivation to stand up again  Si grip seems to be defined more of an unhealthy hyper fixation on details or past events   When their perception becomes distorted and fuzzy  they can feel paralysed and are unable to speak clearly  They can feel exhausted  powerless  unable to figure out their goals  and rigid   The best example of this in Naruto I could see was when Neji died and Obito was basically mocking him    Jiraiya has to ask Naruto about any times he felt kurama s chakra  and it was only after he asked that Naruto was able to remember  In order for Naruto to explain it properly he used an analogy of color  that  his normal chakra feels yellow and the other one feels red   The best analogies for Naruto seem to correlate with sensory information  especially sight  which could be better attributed to Se but I m not sure     As you read the original manga  kishimoto inserts some stories about his childhood  and he does seem to be an ISFP  Much of his thinking towards himself is  Sure I am stupid but things will work out  Life isn t easy for anyone but I ll never give up  It s best not to think too deeply about things   So with that lens  you could say the entirety of the story lends itself to his Se and Fi  With that in mind all characters will superficially express Se  which is why Sasuke sometimes looks like an ISFP  interestingly one of kishimoto s favorite characters   kakashi might look like an ISTP  etc  Even Jiraiya at first seems more ESFP    Based on that frame Naruto could equally use Se and Ne  albeit an extremely oblivious Se user or a less brainstorming Ne user   Basically my point is the possibility of some self insertion on the author s part  making the main character similar to himself  And the possibility of Naruto being an ESFP with very good Ne is something I m definitely considering  Then again the best evidence would be Ni grip  which I haven t exactly seen in Naruto but I m looking for  Ni grip could be defined better as a paranoia of the future  defeatist mindset with only one bad outcome  and anxiety over failure that leads to inaction ,enfp
A ride or die friend  What a king     Ne     idealistic in impractical ways  im going to bring peace to the ninja world    always focused on becoming hokage  future focus   refuses to believe sasuke is evil because he  knows the real him  an se user would look at sasuke s actions and call it how they see it     looks at the potential in people   understands the big picture but isn t bound to a philosophy  he d much rather change other people s philosophies    Si    relates present experiences to past experiences    finds significance meaning in physical items or actions like when he stabs himself to declare he won t need anyone to save him again    unconcerned with comfort  eating ramen all the time or drinking rotten milk     people always tell me I don t know when to quit   does not put much importance on past experiences ,enfp
I see Naruto more as an ESFP because of how he charges full force towards any goals or obstacles he has  mostly without thinking about potential consequences  for example  Aang  who I feel like is an obvious ENFP  is aware of the responsibilities he has as the Avatar  but pushes them aside in favor of having fun and even wishes he wasn t the Avatar at all while Naruto goes for his goal of becoming Hokage with vigor and enthusiasm  not allowing anything to get in the way of his pursuit  Naruto acts without hesitation while Aang has doubts in his own abilities  I m basically saying that Naruto is more like Korra than Aang lol,enfp
Naruto is the definition of a Ne dom  His craftiness lent itself to his tricks and pranks as a boy as well as the idea that someone like him could possibly be a Hokage  This persisted through his teenager years with him coming up with interesting solutions to invent apply ninjutsu and defeat enemies  this is the same guy who literally used the sexy jutsu on Kaguya just to see if it could work  the epitome of subverting expectations   Not only that but his Ne in tandem with his Fi worked to even see the possibility of redemption in the most horrible people and to be able to put himself in their shoes and imagine the possibility that he could ve been exactly like them if it weren t for the people around him  ESFPs are similar to ENFPs but ultimately more realistic and somewhat more competent due to Se Te  which Naruto hardly was  instead preferring to see possibilities and remain future oriented   His unchanging optimism and belief in the face of trials is not a realists way of thinking   Also idk how anyone doesn t see his inferior Si  Rather than adhere to boundaries  routines  and obstacles he prefers to rely on Ne to cross them  His lack of attention to detail both in studying and on the battlefield is apparent  tobirama  an Si user  realizes he s an idiot for it  also instead of figuring out that his mother was appearing before him just by taking a closer look at her he instead jumps to an abstract idea of her being the   tails true form   Also I think he was in Si grip after Jiraiya died  notice how he became extremely withdrawn and reclusive  hyper focusing on the past and buying the same ice cream he and Jiraiya would share   Of course this may be a common reaction to death  ,enfp
The No    Most Unpredictable Ninja    Warning  this text is huge  be patient    I believe many here are used to a stereotyped idea of Ne  like an uncontrolled pulse for ideas and brainstorming   Naruto expresses Ne the way ENFPs often do  a passionate curiosity to embrace variety with empathy   Both Se and Ne are concentrated on the surrounding objects  The difference is in nature  while Se focuses on the objects themselves  on their real  material  and momentary nature  Ne focuses on what is beyond the objects  on their potential  imaginary and future nature   What moves Naruto is exactly the second       Change and Possibility  Rather than chasing one sensation after another and living full realism with energy  Se   Naruto is always chasing change and embracing diversity with excitement  Ne    Naruto was always the boy who hated traditions  norms and pre established things  Ne repressing Si    Not only he didn t accept that something was imposed on him  such as a fate  confrontation with Neji   He rejected and struggled with such things  always aiming to change them  like telling Neji he would change the Hyuuga       If you don t like your destiny  don t accept it  Instead have the courage to change it the way you want it to be    He easily bets all of his chips on an unfinished idea or remote possibility  without a tiny foot on the ground      I don t know how to get there    but someday I ll break the curse    and I will find it    And he easily criticizes superficialities and embraces the idea that there is always a choice      It s not the face    it s the choices they make with their lives        Unpredictability and Reinvention  Naruto s reputation is for being unpredictable  always reinventing himself and dealing with the most diverse situations in the most diverse ways  always surprising everyone around   This ranges from a written exam to a fight  I don t even need to mention Naruto vs Kaguya  right       Associations  I can also notice Ne in more routine cases   It s not uncommon for you to see a scene where he sees something or goes through a situation where he quickly makes associations and comparisons with similar ones  Ne Si    Many of his jutsus were learned by doing mental reimaginings of their real forms  like Rasengan or Sage Mode        Fi mixed with Ne  Naruto is remarkably a dreamy type idealist  NFP   Ne Fi    Even in Classic  he already showed a deep interest in human nature and its individual difficulties when dealing with the most diverse individuals  and this matured even more in Shippudden  which even leads many here to think of him as ENFJ INFJ   Talk no Jutsu is the greatest expression of his Ne   Fi   Naruto is highly open to the different  especially when it comes to the variety of people  Ne   Fi    His focus on understanding personal differences  putting himself in the eyes of others  and understanding their deepest perspectives and feelings with empathy is the greatest demonstration of the combined nature of Ne and Fi   He easily peers into the individual depths of others  Fi  and assesses them from various angles  Ne   as just different ways of thinking   Thanks to this  he easily gains empathy even from enemies  and manages to dampen their stubbornness  causing them to change sides   Rather than infecting people with his energy  actions and achievements  just like an ESFP   he inspires people with his ideas  causes and speeches  just like an ENFP        Lower function maturing at the end of the series  The Inferior Function is like a child  which shows a need for maturity  and exposes a weakness of the dominant function   When you cannot rely on innovation alone  Ne   it is necessary to return to traditions  Si    One of the greatest demonstrations of Naruto s maturity is that he recognizes the importance of learning from the past  keeping personal experiences with care  letting his Si inf give him balance to deal with different situations   You notice this a lot in his conversation with Sasuke  in his final fight  or even before that  during the war  during his speeches   This kind of maturity of the inferior function is also noticed in Sasuke   Sasuke  INTJ   in the last episode of Shippuuden  relieves his stubbornness and personal views  and allows himself to travel and see the world with more realistic eyes  Se inf      Conclusion  A mindset aimed at change  variety  comparisons  unpredictability and reinvention is exactly a psyche driven by Ne   In summary  Naruto is a legitimate ENFP  embracing diversity with eccentricity  being always unpredictable  passionate  and open to the most different ways of seeing life ,enfp
Personally I believe Naruto to be an ESFP  Here are my reasons   Se dominance  Naruto is someone who lives in the moment  Some people may say he lives in the future  but I disagree  Naruto  while he does have goals for the future  does not constantly dwell in the future and imagine possibilities like an ENFP would  I believe ENFP voters are confusing his Big    SCUAI  for Ne dominance  when in reality  it s because of that he is so dreamy and idealistic  Naruto prefers to be in and adapt to the present  not anticipating future possibilities    Naruto does not experiment with various possibilities like an ENFP would either  Sasuke himself even said that Naruto relied on using his shadow clones to bombard his enemies  Naruto basically only used   techniques for the majority of the series  Shadow Clones  Rasengan  and it s variants   and Rasenshuriken  And Oiroke no Jutsu of course  An ENFP would be more inclined to experiment with more fighting styles and branch out  Take Jiraiya  who had an large assortment of various techniques  and compare him to Naruto  There s a difference    Like anything  you ve gotta learn by doing and feeling    How am I supposed to focus on all these tiny little details  I m the type that learns by doing  you know    Naruto is a very hands on  kinesthetic person who prefers to learn by doing  That is a common trait among Se doms  who don t like theoretical things and tend to take things at face value  Naruto is action oriented and a doer  rather than someone who is possibilities oriented like an ENFP would be    Ni inferior  Naruto is someone who tends to take things at face value and jumps into things without thinking  While ENFPs can be impulsive as well  they tend to be more oriented to possibilities and enjoy daydreaming  Naruto doesn t  really  He is action oriented and doesn t really stop to think  One example of Se Ni axis is when he tried to teach the Rasengan to Konohamaru  He couldn t articulate his thoughts enough as he is very kinesthetic and not good at explaining his ideas and thoughts  He goes through things in a very sensory manner  Naruto  for the majority of the series  does not really understand the concept of forethought as well  Actual Ne users in the show like Kakashi and Shikamaru are shown to connect ideas and possibilities together  and are good at brainstorming  Naruto does not like brainstorming or thinking about possibilities  he prefers to be in the center of action and figure it out as he goes ,enfp
 I don t want regrets   I don t want to think   I should have done it   and you guys are still voting for a Ne dom instead of Se  ,enfp
Naruto is extremely aware and present in the moment  It seems like fighting comes pretty natural to him  which is reliant on using the senses and physical coordination ,enfp
Intuitives are an assumption based personalities  They plan out their attacks before interacting   Yes even the most improvised Ne types plan their actions too  for ex kakashi and shikamaru  kiske from bleach  the joker  etc    From the beginning  naruto always charged in battle w  nothing but quick thinking from the situation ,enfp
El SE se centra principalmente en vivir el presente  en cambio el NE se centra en la construcci n de su futuro  el convertirse en hokage a causa de tener una infancia donde nadie le prestaba atenci n  el querer ser reconocido  en emprender  buscar a su amigo a toda costa  y asi mismo crecer como persona   Naruto siempre ha mirado hacia el futuro  fue mas un so ador que alguien que se empe aba en disfrutar del momento   en mi opini n esto en shippuden toma mas fuerza   pd  spanish pls,enfp
He s actually very open to discussion about his personality type  I made a comment saying he was ENFP before  which I still think so  but I also noticed that Naruto is  Ne  future oriented and creative  but at the same time  Se  jumps into everything without thinking and has a spontaneous personality  It has both functions  but when an event occurs  he first tries to solve it with the  Se  function  and when it cannot solve the problem with the  Se  function  it solves the event with its creativity using the  Ne  function  But I noticed that he improves the  Ne  function more for time  So I think the Ne function is more dominant  But  t s too eccentric to use both functions almost equally   actually  there are more features that can be said  but I have mentioned the most prominent features for now ,enfp
Definitivamente para m  es ENFP Dir a algo m s pero todo est  en ingl s ajskdk,enfp
As ENFP I always could relate to Naruto  but now its clear he isnt Ne dom  He has his ne moments  but ne isn t always talking just randomly things that makes no sense  it can be   but most of the time Ne users have really deep thoughts  I dont know  i might be wrong about him but thats how I see it ,enfp
I honestly have no idea how people could say he is a ENFP man  His drive to work harder than anybody else to make himself stronger is a huge Indicator of Introverted intuition  Not to mention he wants to get stronger because he wants to help not only his friend who is walking down a dark path  but mainly he wants to be able to protect the whole village and everyone in it  How can you say he uses Fi  When he was young he was without parents and depressed thats why he maybe kind of acted like a nfp at times  because of being gripped by his shadow  Also y all  the way that he acts as a hokage  he puts his body on the line for literally anyone in the village  no favoritism or anything like that  That is a true Fe user when you see self sacrifice at this level  INFJs are probably one of the most self sacrificing of the types not to mention  He would literally take a sword in the guts for anybodg in his  family   his  family  is the entire village remember  He does not care about his own feelings  once he grew up and matured  he never stopped worrying and doing for other people  ENFPs are really concerned about other people because of the way that those people affect their feelings  Do you ever hear naruto say he needs to help someone because if he doesn t his feelings will be hurt  He does things for others intuitively and without concern for himself ,enfp
INSIGHT  Naruto  ENFP Naruto Shippuden  ESFP Fictional characters are not always consistent  Naruto as a kid had this creative trickiness to him  subverting expectations with his pranks  Like when he was suppose to take a formal passport styled picture but he painted his face in a  Kabuki  style  When he got the pattern of a fence and hide behind it to camouflage himself as he was being chased  Kidnapping and impersonating sasuke to get a kiss lol  Creating the sexy jutsu  etc  For his age he seemed to portray a high level of creative intelligence  But as he grew up  Shippuden  he became more straightforeward and single minded as a character  and the humour mainly surounded silly situations about how dim he was  also being physically attacked by Sakura    This explain why his type is so intensely contesteted between the two camps ,enfp
ENFP voters  what s your definition of Se and Ne    I think of Ne as a very creative function since it can find a lot of possibilities for anything  I don t see Naruto like that  he is more likely to get inspiration from what he sees or hears ,enfp
Realisation  Young Naruto  ENFP Naruto Shippuden  ESFP  Fictional characters are not always consistent ,enfp
omfg is Naruto this inconsistent of a character or have the people on this site just gone mad lmao  Honestly Naruto has always seemed like a    clear cut Se user to me  tho I haven t watched the show in a long time so I m not really in much of a position to make a proper argument  Still  the amount of votes both ENFP and ESFP have and the amount of comments on this profile are honestly impressive,enfp
enneagram   baby              wing because he is smart sometimes      kin   ,enfp
He is a pretty obvious fe dom imo  His whole behaviour is centered about others and his care and love for his friends gets stronger and more obvious the more he gets  He only seems like a high fi user at first because he is an outsider but look at him he only desires community and being part of the village to prove his worth to others  Do you really think high fi would desire the position of Hokage because then he would get the respect he so desperately wants  Fi especially high fi doesnt crave or care for the approval or general emotional perception they just want to follow their feelings  Compare Naruto for example with Luffy from OP who is a clear ESFP  When doing this the contrast between their fe and fi gets very clear  While Luffy is completely selfcentered and does what he wants but respects and tolerates that kind of behaviour from others Naruto doesnt because he sees people from a communiative more collective perspective and follows a clear path of objective morals like help the weak etc which Luffy doesnt care about thats also why Naruto clashes with Sasuke who as a fi user whether he is ISFP or ixtj just wants to follow his path and feels deeply infringed and confused by Naruto why does he care so much about him or others    That is the striking difference between them Naruto cant understand Sasuke and vice versa because he doesnt base his feelings on himself and only in relation with others while Sasuke is fully personal  Let the downvoting begin ,enfp
Se dom    don t make me laugh ,enfp
spoiler ahead   I think ESFP makes more sense  A Ne dom would be more abstract with their approach to situations and ideas  Naruto was always focused on present situation without much thought on the future or consequences  He always just jumps into situations without really thinking about them I think a Ne dom would be more careful because they often think about new possibilities and ideas  When he was learning or experiencing new things he always preferred to use his senses  Also his inferior Ni  His overly optimistic look on future without any worries  Even his dream of being a Hokage didn t really have a deeper meaning at the beginning  His look on life and having trouble in finding deep meaning to situations and ideas would be a sign of inferior Ni  I think that also a great example of his inferior Ni grip was when Jiraya died and Naruto didn t see any positive outcomes for the future and he fell into sadness  An inf Si  ENFP  would have more problems with their ego and I think that Naruto never had a problem with his personality ,enfp
I havent watched the series entirely but I get big Se vibes  Se users can imagine as much as Ne users can live in the moment ikik but I see more Se,enfp
I never saw Naruto as someone that preferred to perceive new ideas over reality as he experienced it  Both Ne and Se are functions that are inclined towards curiosity  however Ne is inclined to work away from perceived methods of doing things to ponder new possibilities while Se is inclined to work away from perceiving implications in order to capitalize on opportunities that present itself  Naruto is a curious individual indeed but I think it might be a stretch to say that his cognitive realm of comfort lies outside of perceiving his direct environment to perceive ideas that are novel in concept  Naruto is not interested in novelty for the sake of novelty  He is notoriously perceived as a knucklehead ninja due to his inability to perceive things out of the box  but recognized as a  genius  because of his ability to figure things out in the moment and make them work  With Ne doms there is an aspect of them that perceives novel possibilities before they immerse themselves in new experiences  anticipating the reality of their theories before they ground themselves in the actuality of the moment  Naruto  imo  has shown himself to be an individual that does not preplan or consider ideas until the moment gives him stimulus to work with and take control of  Take an Ne user like Shikamaru or Kakashi  individuals who consider likelihoods  brainstorming potential outcomes and working between the realms of these outcomes  Naruto doesnt naturally do this and everytime he does it is usually at the behest of an Ne user that is telling to at least consider possibilities and likelihoods so that he doesnt rush into a situation head on and pay for it like he has a history of doing over and over  Naruto at his best is observant and calculating of sensory phenomena  Take his fight with the  rd Raikage  Naruto didnt naturally use Ne to figure him out  Rather it was Se and Ni that factored into his analysis  What he noticed was the scar on Raikages chest and what fueled his analysis was the consideration of why that scar was there  He wanted to know what caused the scar and how it affected the raikage and used a simulative train of thought to perceive how it happened  to then replicate that idea in reality  Narutos greatest weakness has always been that he sees and reacts to sensory stimuli too easily  In most of his fights  such as with Neji  Naruto initiates his fights not by considering possibilities but by charging in head first  experiencing the situation and then paying attention to why people act how they act to then try again and then edit his behavior in line with the core reasoning he has noticed behind someones actions  He is a creative ninja but he is certainly not a possibility oriented thinker like Shikamaru  Kakashi or even Jiraiya  He is a headstrong ninja that puts himself in the fire and adapts to the circumstances  He is a man that perceives linear lines of actions to take and capitalize on those actions ,enfp
Fictional characters  besides being fictional characters  usually fit well one MBTI type  Naruto seems to be an exception  There are some important characteristics of him that don t have anything do to with Se dom and  on the other hand  some that don t have anything to do with Ne dom  So I understand both ENFP and ESFP voters here   He is dreamy  idealistic  unorthodox  hyperactive and unpredictably creative   The No    Most Unpredictable Ninja   as described by Kakashi   If he was a real person  he definitely would have ADHD or something like that  These points could make me type him as ENFP   But it s also shown all the time that he has more of a  hands on  capacity of learning stuff  through body  senses and experience  which can be seem as Se  People explain something to him in a more theoretical way and he responds like  I didn t understand anything you said  but let me try with my own hands     This comes up not only when training his ninja skills  but also in other moments  When things get deeper and the characters talk about  the hatred of the world    how to stop war and achieve peace  and this sort of thing  which happens all the time in the show   some of his lines are very Se like   I can t write like Ero Sennin  so the sequel of the story has to come from my own life    talking to Nagato after defeating the  th Pain    Who can tell which is the dangerous path in the beginning  I want to go through this unknown and dangerous path    talking to Obito just before he regreted the things he did    In the big picture  we can see Naruto  with his resilience throughout the whole story  as A PERSON WHO ALWAYS SAYS  YES  TO LIFE  which  again  is a very Se   Fi thing   I would still go with ENFP  because the ENFP points I mentioned are more outstanding in the character and the way he connects with Sasuke  Ni dom  undoubtedly  also doesn t make much sense if he s an ESFP  I keep my vote on ENFP  but  anyway  he s not a very good representation of the ENFP personality ,enfp
happy birthday  he deserves the world,enfp

Se   Action oriented  Ne   Assumptions oriented  Naruto is the most action oriented person even in naruto world   it is quite            to say  Ne is the reason he asks question about reasons and motivations    This is massively underestimating ESFP capabilities to understand peoples  Fi is process oriented function  Fi likes to understand intricacies of emotions  that is not at all related to Ne  peoples are blinded by how ESFP are portrayed in TVs  they think Fi as NF trait  it is NOT  this is very shallow understanding of function   why did mods delete this     i will add this  it is not about  he is creative  he has Ne ideas   let s say he has it  but is it his preference   is ideation is default   heads up empathy is not ideation  he instantly involves  acts  interacts with reality  his problem dont come from him ideating too much  his problems comes from acting irrationally  this is seen over and over again in war arc   his ideas are layered  collection of interrelated ideas like Ni not flash of unrelated ideas like Ne   it should be super simple  peoples overcomplicate because they want naruto to be ENFP  or they always saw him as ENFP and they refuse to change mind  Type by preference  super basic principle of typology   not what he is good at  he is good at Ni at times  Yes  he prefers action not ideation ,enfp
Let s provide a general description and then explain the cognitive function stack  ENFPs are  idea generators  much more than they are  detail people   Often ingenious designers of  win win  solutions that have a long term positive impact on people  ENFPs are a continuous source of  out of the box  ideas  Exceptionally optimistic  ENFPs more than any other type believe that everything is possible  They naturally put others needs before their own  and often go well out of their way to maintain harmony in their relationships  ENFPs develop thicker skins over the course of their lives  but generally they tend to take criticism personally  and may read more into feedback than was intended  Generous and empathetic  ENFPs have a special gift for leaving others feeling inspired and valued for their unique gifts  ENFPs naturally provide energetic support  appreciation  and positive feedback to others   Cognitive Function Stack   Ne  Extraverted Intuition is the mother of all ideas  and Uzumaki Naruto is a constant creative force  coming up with new techniques  new ways of using old techniques he constantly finds ideas that other people would not expect  and he is the    most surprising ninja   Fi  Naruto has a strong moral compass and internal value system  His feelings and values are the fuel for much of his actions  He doesn t take back his words  as he is determined to stay true to the feelings that drove him to say them  His compassion for others comes from empathy he draws from his own life experience to find similarities with people that allow him to feel what they do   Te  This isn t a total strength for Naruto  in part because his education was undermined throughout his youth  and in part because his emotions are so strong they often stop him from being able to lean on extraverted thinking very much  But  deep down  Naruto is a man of action  It s not enough for him to understand how others feel and not do something about the problem  He ll do whatever he can that makes sense to help  He ll change the Hyuuga for Neji  once he figures out what to do to make that happen  At a tactical level  he is very capable of putting together an elaborate plan  remember the tricky plans he used against Zabuza to free Kakashi  Or the one he used on Kaguya  Or the trap laid against Nagato   At a larger strategic level  he doesn t know enough to be effective  but he values the trait in others and will defer to people who are better able to put together an actionable plan   Si  Si in it s core is about providing strong subjective sensations to external objects and that s why they can remember details vividly  Naruto doesn t lean on introverted sensing consciously  but there s a certain sense of nostalgia that s very dear to him internally  He s passionately in love with his village  regardless of wherever else he goes  Though he does seem to shove his negative memories aside unless he needs them for empathy  he uses his memories frequently as fuel  and he taps into strong emotions when recalling them  And he recalls them vividly ,enfp
Look he is ENFP even if you change him to ESFP he will still be in ENFP because in the story he s is ENFP look at his personality not the story if you look at his personality you say that I m right not any main character is ESFP so stop and accept that sasuke is INTJ and Naruto is ENFP and if you re not agree no it s your problem not mine ok and ESFP and ENFP sometimes the same but ENFP is a dreamer can we stop because in vote sasuke and Naruto is a mess and this is the first time we get the personality right please don t mess it up,enfp
Omg ok this is hard  so NeFiTeSi vs SeFiTeNi   Ne s usually have multiple interpretations of reality while Se s tend to think that reality is this one way and that one way only from what I see naruto thinks about how his life would be if things where different and thinks about the many different possibilities  Ses think more about the here and now and are focused on reality while Nes are more focused on multiple perspectives  here naruto seems to think a lot about the future and  daydream  Also i noticed that he thinks about the past a lot in like flashbacks however that could be for the viewer and it could be Fi and totally not related   Ses usually go along with their ideas rather than just think about it like Nes a clear example of this is how naruto actually becomes hokage    I didn t write that much because i do not feel like it but after some thought i think he may actually be an ENFP  An ENFP whose Ne isn t fully developed   Edit  ill leave my mistake so ppl understand  what I mean is he is an ENFP but you can see how he uses Se at the same time  leaving my vote empty for now  Im not the best at typing so do not take everything i say seriously and don t rely on my information please do correct me if I m wrong about something,enfp
He demonstrates features that can refer to both Se and Ne  I vote for ESFP because I don t know if Ne can be SEE  And not only for that  but also because he s slow to understand more abstract subjects  Ni inf   he always needs to find a way to experiment and simplify things in a more hands on way  without getting confused by the abstract possibilities  Se can be creative  but Se s creativity is for situational manipulation of viable resources  expressing and adapting them in a practical and spontaneous way  knowing how to be circumstancial and improvise with tools and simplify them to achieve something  They are excellent tactical and opportunists ,enfp
I have to agree  after a long round of debates  it is very difficult to type a fictional character      I just wanted to share my perspective  Having goals is considered a Ne argument because inferior Ni makes a person do things related to daily life without understanding the meaning of what the point of it is or what it could lead to    Naruto never had a problem with understanding  the possible impacts of other actions  he was driven by it  There are many other Ne arguments but I ve already posted enough about this     I don t wanna repeat      Feel free to reply Only Civil debates We can agree to disagree   ,enfp
let s leave the votes tied then Naruto gets   mbtis nice   Okay I m just kidding I know that can t happen Lol ,enfp
it s a shame he will never be voted as ISFP,enfp
Naruto is one of those characters that doesn t make sense  His childhood is about being abandoned and feeling he belonged nowhere  It is based about how he couldn t be like normal kids who didn t have the Kyuubi  He wanted to be the Hokage so people would accept him and notice him  Naruto wanted attention  just that  he shouldn t have really been hokage  Naruto s traumas and behaviour when child are from a  w  sp so  he is trying to get attention and to be noticed  E  does not make a lot of sense since E s are not focused on just one goal  social   wants as much prestige as it can get  all the time  Naruto is not this  He weirdly behaves like a   when it comes down to helping people and when thinking about Sasuke  he does not try to look good  he genuinely believes he is a saviour  He is not fixated on deception like actual  s  his fixation is  I m gonna suck all of the hate and all of the pain in the world so I can prove you that I have the value you guys didn t give me  I m gonna be the saviour so you guys can see me   He is a  w  sp so that disintegrated to  ,enfp
Naruto is clearly not a Ne dom  Characters with Ne always adapts the sensory information anticipating future probabilities  Always driving to seek new information  they normally explore a lot before making a decision  very important here  using creativity    Naruto never showed any characteristic of Ne  Besides  he is extremely impulsive and sometimes reckless  He does not think before doing  He process the information in the moment without the intervention that Ne does  For example  people that watched the anime probably recognize that he just use one jutsu every time  people with Ne normally would think in a lot of ways to win one fight  But Naruto doesn t  he process the fight and he use his high Se to deal with that    And  in my opinion  the situation between Naruto and his dream to become hokage is clearly Ni  He did not want that just for the title  but the meaning he put in this role   It s just sad how this site works  Naruto fix in the ENFP stereotype about being funny  energetic and  obviously  the main character  But the functions are not connected at all  He is clearly an ESFP  i hope this get correct soon   ,enfp

Ok so I ve been thinking about this while talking to someone on this thread and I ve come up with some things that I m like          sure of      Naruto has high Fi    Naruto uses Ni  not Ne  Now while I m positive Naruto doesn t have Ne in his stack  I think ENFP voters are on to the fact that Naruto is indeed more stuck on his goals and ideals than he is on reality  Naruto s kinda naive and if he were given the trolley problem I swear he d say something like  Well whatever I ll save everyone on both tracks idk how but I ll become stronger so that can somehow happen   I gotta admit  he s more focussed on an idealized future than he is the reality of the problem and the details that are in front of him  which I think shows Ni   Se  But then again  him being a dumbass and rushing into things without thinking about the consequenses shows Se   Ni  That leads to my  rd conclusion      His Se and Ni are both used and there s a possibility they re around the same amount   Since his Fi is wayyy too high to be tertiary or inferior  there s   possible conclusions I ve come up with      He s an ESFP with developed Ni  which is even higher than his Te  Is this possible  I don t know all the rules when it comes to typing cases like this      He s a socially extroverted ISFP   I wanna know what people think about this  especially about the possibility of him being ISFP  cause though he  feels  like he s not an ISFP whatsoever  the ISFP stack makes a lot of sense for him  Also disclaimer  I m an ISFP but I swear I don t kin Naruto  we re nothing alike tbh,enfp
How is this debate still going on  Naruto has ZERO idea how to operate with anything abstract  I m not calling him stupid  matter of fact  he s actually really smart  just not in an Ne way   Inferior Ni is pretty clear in how he just rushes into things head on without thinking much about the consequences  Naruto isn t the type to ponder about the underlying ideas of situations as they happen  Instead  he s all about seizing opportunities as they present themselves and appreciating things in the here and now    Besides that  can someone explain his enneagram    feels like a really weird fit ,enfp
I can t believe you guys really think this  How can      people be so clueless  First of all  he acts nothing like an ENFP let alone a Ne dom How tf is this the consensus   second have you guys seen that horrible Ni and impulsivity  Everyone who votes ENFP needs to do better research  because he definitely does not have lower Se than INTJ Sasuke  He should literally be seen as the president of Se doms  The intuitive bias on this site really is too much ,enfp

I think I actually have to agree with the ENFP consensus  While I originally figured him to be Se dom as a result of his impulsive nature  I think I was actually attributing his cognition too much towards his sociotype  Not to say that an ESFP couldn t be idealistic  truth be told they really CAN be  but Naruto s sense of idealism always seemed to come from some unrealistic envisionment of peace  This is something that the Pain arc REALLY harped on  Not to mention the conversations he d have with those he was trying to convert  often times I find Naruto is attempting to sell some sort of alternate perspective to whatever conception they have of the world  Always trying to get people to see the  what if   or even trying to explore it for himself   For example  when Sasuke left the village and everyone labeled him a rogue ninja that needed to be terminated  Naruto objects saying that Sasuke is not who he seems and that there is another side to consider to the story  He implicates more possibilities than what would practically be needed for someone valuing Se as their dominant function  It s almost like Naruto plays devil s advocate  but in an Fi kind of way  it s hard to explain  Otherwise I think everyone else did a great job arguing for the type lol   Edit  FFS now I don t know again    I really just need to rewatch the show  I can honestly see both types as equally viable so I ll at least remove my vote for now ,enfp
Ne    Sees the greater potential of an object   Will choose to see different  creative  and impractical solutions just for the novelty of it   Always looking for a new way of doing something   Focussed on multiple factors and possibilities  Se    Lives in the present moment   Grounded  aware of what is physically going on around them   Practical  prefers realistic solutions   Relies on information perceived through their   senses   Naruto having a dream doesn t make him an Ne dom  A better way to type him is to observe his thinking process and how he solves problems   One example is when he first tried to do Rasengan  While the way he ended up achieving it was creative  he was completely stumped on how to accomplish it and didn t even attempt thinking outside the box until he saw a cat playing with the balloon he was training with  and decided to simulate it in order to get the water to move  This is a prime example of his reliance on Se  and not on Ne   Whenever he s frustrated that he s not getting stronger fast enough  which is a lot   his solution is basically to KEEP TRAINING KEEP TRAINING KEEP TRAINING  which is a good example of a Se Te loop  An Ne user in a Ne Te loop would become hyper focussed on using data to determine how things would play out in multiple scenarios  I can t think of any time I ve seen Naruto do this   These are just a few examples  but to put it in a nutshell  Naruto is more reliant on his   senses than on his intuition  He s impulsive and tends to act physically WITHOUT thinking about the consequences or implications  In fact  he s infamous for doing that    Maybe people think he s ENFP because he s known as the    hyperactive knucklehead ninja with an lofty dream  Whatever it is  focus on what Ne and Se are when typing him  not on stereotypes ,enfp
Compare Naruto  ENFP  with Deidara  ESFP  and we can see the difference between their lives approaches   Deidara motivation towards life are the explosions  the arts that he create inside the real world  Almost all of him is about sensations through the   senses  as a dominating function normally behave  Se  Deidara s quote   Fine art is the beauty of that single fleeing moment of explosion   That s a SeFi driven character  Naruto motivation towards life are the potentials regarding himself and regarding people  plus understanding people through different perspectives  Sasuke  Pain  Nagato  Gaara  Obito  Haku  Kyuubi   Potentials  possibilities and perspectives  this is Ne  Some people are just overvaluing Ne  Naruto quote   Hard work is worthless for those that don t believe in themselves    That s a NeFi driven character ,enfp
Naruto is introverted and not social so he is INFP  Why is everyone voting for him ENFP ESFP  ,enfp
I feel bad for ESFPs they always end replaced by an  more interesting  intuitive type,enfp
  I want to be hokage  This is clearly his dream and his second dream peace and protect the village  ESFP ok   ,enfp
I m probably gonna get downvoted for it but imo  Naruto is a big time sensor  The fact that he has one specific goal he wants to accomplish does not make him future oriented  He s extremally impulsive  has problems with planning and easily gets caught up with what s happening now  to the point that he forgets about his future goal plans  The fact that he has ambition does not make him intuitive  He gets so caught up with his rivalry with Sasuke  his desire to help him  that his goal of becoming Hokage gets sidetacked so hard he doesn t rise beyond genin until he s almost an adult  Naruto struggles to understand anything theory oriented  to the point that Kakashi comes up with special learning program just for him   because he knows Naruto is way better at understanding in practice  and trying over and over again until he gets it right ,enfp
Naruto is ENFP  Ne Fi Te Si  Ne dom  he is always focused on the world of future possibilities  rather than living in the present moment  He has really unrealistic dreams for the future like bringing peace to an extremely violent world and ending the cycle of hatred just like Jiraiya  also an ENFP  btw   He also dreams of convincing a rogue ninja to turn good again  Then he also has that hokage dream ever since he was literally the worst student in the class  Naruto dreams big but doesn t deliberately plan how to make his dreams a reality  he just is consumed by future idealizations and acts upon that  This is an ENFP trait  Many people here are saying he never  plans for the future  so he can t be ENFP  But you are mistaking ENFJ and ENFP  ENFP has nothing to do with planning  it has more to do with idealizing the future without planning  which Naruto is a master at  ESFPs are honestly way more grounded in the present and living in the present  They obviously can have goals but the difference is that the majority of the time  Naruto is living for the future and not experiencing the present to the fullest like a typical Se dom  We also see Naruto making really abstract and deep connections about people and situations  another Ne trait   With pain  he made an extremely abstract connection between a particular phrase in Jiraiya s book  and Pain s question about the answer for peace  Naruto is sooo good at finding deeper connections and patterns in things  like he did with Obito too  Just because he is stupid  doesn t mean he isn t good at seeing abstract aspects of things  He doesn t see most things at surface level like Se doms  He almost always reads deeper into everything and reads between the lines about people s actions  So many times in battles  he tries to ask the villain why they re doing what they re doing  He always want to find out what s going on underneath the surface and figure out the abstract below the surface  and that s why he s extremely Ne dom   Extraverted Intuition involves noticing hidden meanings and interpreting them  looking deep into what someone s behavior means  Naruto naturally is always interested in the hidden meanings of things  That s what his whole personality is about  He seeks to understand the  why  of people s actions  situations  and behaviors  He doesn t focus on the  what  like an Se  but he focuses on the  why   With Gaara he created an abstract connection between the two of their situations  and saw past the actions on the surface  He didn t even care that he murdered tons of people in the present moment  He looked very deep into the situation and theorized about it like Ne s do  With Sasuke s situation  there was one time when Naruto was hyperventilating because he was extremely anxious about the future  He didn t take sasuke s actions for what they were  His thoughts were spiraling and he was not grounded in the present at all  It s very clear that he is not Se from this  Naruto is never grounded in the present and truly focusing on the moment like an Se dom  He s always thinking about the future and what to do next  Ever since Sasuke left  he wouldn t even rest one day and was constantly thinking about the future and how to save him  We also see that Naruto and Obito are extremely alike  and pretty much parallel versions of the same person  and Obito is an ENFP   People on here are confusing being smart with being ENFP  You do not have to be smart or good at understanding tough concepts to be ENFP  any mbti could be good at that  Obito was also really bad at understanding concepts when he was younger  and he s pretty much the exact same as naruto except dark evil  He s an ENFP and he had a very tough time in school and didn t understand the conceptual abstract information  Ne vs Se is how you perceive the world  whether you have a more realistic take and experience the five senses strongly or whether you tend to think about deeper meanings and connections  and are more lost in your head  In pretty much every battle  Naruto has been the first to fall for environment traps so there s no way he could be Se dom  which is supposed to be good at sensing the environment  Naruto has always looked for the deeper meaning in things  and even in the first battle when he was    he asked Haku  why  Why    He wanted to know Haku s story and the abstract connections behind his actions and relationship with Zabuza  At    years old  That s honestly such an Ne thing to do  wanting to understand the layers within a situation  He uses NeFi to understand the hidden meanings in battles  Ne  and then empathize with them  Fi   If he was Se he would take things more at face value  which we know this boy doesn t ,enfp
yeaaahhh naruto is kinda retard and has a lot of energy  obviously he s an ENFP  D dude please  study cognitive functions,enfp
I mean  if Naruto is so iconic and stands out so much between hundreds of shonen protagonists it has to be because he s a Ne dom instead of a Se dom    Right    ,enfp
He is the most obvious INTP  w  Y all should t even be allowed on PDB for making this big of a mistype  F  ing stereotypist dichotomy voters ,enfp
The only problem with this profile is people do not understand the difference between instinct and intuition ,enfp
Oh look  if it isn t one of the most popular anime protagonists  Naruto Uzumaki  I guess we ve gotten a new rule associating shonen protagonists and Big     The dumber you are  the higher you score on Inquisitiveness  Nevertheless  I don t think Naruto is that stupid  he is at least smarter than Goku  Gon or some certain pink haired kid with the power of friendship   I m not even gonna talk about his MBTI   About his enneagram  it s pretty clear  He strives not only to achieve in his goal  but to gain the attention and social status he deserved  The   wing is because he has the heart of a shonen protagonist   But wait a minute    are you sure he is just Sanguine  Naruto is stubborn  hot tempered and competitive af  not to mention he is super ambitious about his goal  so don t you think he has a Choleric blend ,enfp
did u know that the naruto manga has start today before    years ,enfp
Ne   He is the natural champion of all minorities with a future  Because he is able  when oriented more to people than things  to make an intuitive diagnosis of their abilities and potentialities  he can also  make  men    Carl Jung  CW    par      ,enfp
IDK IF HE IS A ENFP OR ESFP BUT ENFP FITS HIM WELL ,enfp
No one explained IEE for him so I would just do that  probably later when I have time ,enfp
Sanguine  dominant   limbic         Have you definitely watched this anime  Naruto is very hot tempered and competitive  I m not even going to watch Boruto  so I don t take it into account  As for ENFP and ESFP  both options are correct  since he  like many fictional characters  was not adjusted to Mbti  and he can t be exactly typed,enfp
  Times Naruto Proved Talk No Jutsu Is The Best Type Of Jutsu      Naruto s Resolve Reminded Tsunade Of Her Loved Ones  Naruto accompanied Jiraiya to convince Tsunade to become the Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village  Taken aback when Tsunade refused to take the position by calling it a fool s job  he started shouting at her  Later  Tsunade asked him what made him so passionate about the name of Hokage  to which he replied with resolve that it was his dream to be Hokage one day  This reminded her of her long dead brother  Nawaki  and boyfriend  Dan  both of whose dreams were also to become Hokage  This Talk no Jutsu imbued conversation set into motion the events that led to her finally accepting the position of Hokage      Sai Could No Longer Be Emotionless After Meeting Naruto  Sai was a member of Danzo s secret organization  Root  which trained its Shinobi to be devoid of all emotions and simply follow orders  When Sai first met Naruto  he saw the amount of passion Naruto had for his friend  He asked him why he was willing to go to such lengths for a person who did not care about him  to which Naruto replied with a whole speech about how he would never give up on Sasuke even if it took his whole body  It was several displays of passion like this that eventualy helped Sai get in touch with his own emotions and begin to function like a normal human      Naruto s Determination Completely Transformed Gaara Into A Better Person  When he was young  Gaara was a boy who only lived for himself and gained satisfaction from killing others  When he saw Naruto fight so hard to protect the people he loved  he asked Naruto why he would put so much effort into other people even if it meant he would die  Naruto then used the Talk no Jutsu on him to make him realize the importance of friends in life  and how it was their acceptance that made him strong  After that conversation  Gaara became a completely transformed person who then made it his life s mission to help and serve others      Even A Creature Of Pure Hatred Was Not Able To Resist This Jutsu  Kurama  the Nine Tailed Fox who was sealed inside Naruto  was a creature full of intense hatred and loathing  After Naruto had defeated his dark side  he promised Kurama that he would come after all the hatred that was stored inside him  This statement surprised Kurama and developed a soft side inside him for the boy  which led to them eventually becoming great friends and helping each other during battle  The jutsu was so strong that it turned a beast of hate into a creature who started to care about the world      Naruto s Words Made Nagato Believe In World Peace Again  After all of his Pain clones were defeated  Naruto confronted Nagato and asked him the reason behind his destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village  and Nagato obliged  Naruto then used his Talk no Jutsu on him and reminded him of the teachings of their sensei  Jiraiya  and how he would not stop until he had achieved true peace in the world  The determination in Naruto s words made Nagato believe him  and he had a complete change of heart  He used the Rinne rebirth jutsu to bring back everyone he had killed and entrusted Naruto with bringing peace to the world before he died      Naruto Made Obito Uchiha Get Back In Touch With His Good Side  As a child  Obito was a very helpful and selfless person who dreamed of becoming the Hokage  much like Naruto  When Naruto saw his memories  he knew he had to use his jutsu on Obito to bring him back to the good side  all the while ignoring the fact that he was a mass murderer who killed thousands of people  including his own parents  Naruto augmented his Talk no Jutsu with a hefty punch when Obito tried to resist  which triggered several memories for the Uchiha  and he finally realized how wrong he had been all along  From then on  he helped the Shinobi alliance win the war and even gave up his life protecting his comrades      Sasuke Finally Succumbed To Naruto s Jutsu After Years Of Resistance  Sasuke was the one person who seemed to be able to resist Naruto s Talk no Jutsu no matter what he said or how hard he tried  Naruto spent year after year and fight after fight trying to bring Sasuke back to the good side but to no avail  However  if Naruto was anything  he was persistent and stubborn and did not know when to quit  Over the years  he kept throwing jutsu after jutsu on his best friend until he finally wore him down  thus proving that his Talk no Jutsu was the ultimate jutsu    Everybody should be afraid of Talk No Jutsu,enfp
Citation by   sarati     badmanaf                 creativity is both se and ne  he comes up with new things by analyzing his surroundings and responding instinctively and reflexively to them  I don t remember very many examples of him being lost in his own world thinking of intuitive ideas and possibilities  whenever he has one of his rare intuitive thoughts  thinking of what could be   it seems ni  based on visions for the future and hunches  he s very grounded in the present moment and is in tune with his bodily sensations  he decides how to react to situations based on what his body is telling him to do     There are very many similarities between Naruto and Obito  but I always thought there was a core difference in the way they functioned  While ne is about existing in reality  there is still a certain detachment present in ne users that I don t see in naruto  Obito  an ENFP  is way more dreamy and out of tune with his body and surroundings than naruto  he is bad at responding instinctively to things and always has to put thought into his actions or force himself to move  naruto tends to just do  he just rushes into situations and his guide is what his body is telling him  Obito is very intuitive  always daydreaming and thinking of what could happen rather than what is real  he understands theoretical concepts and is way better at making intuitive connections than naruto  naruto even seems to struggle with these very ne things sometimes  it s hard to imagine that it s his dominant function        Naruto has such an obvious inferior Ni goal  Hokage  Hokage  Hokage    I notice a lot of people who argue Ne exclude the fact the inferior function from the argument  If naruto had an inf Si he would place more value on his past experiences like with Jiraya constantly recollecting to his past with Pain to envision a future for peace in the Shinobi world  Naruto with his inf Ni and Se dom sees little value for the past as cased in his fight with Neji where he despises the idea of destiny  It s also part of the reason he didn t end up like Obito a Ne user because he lives so much present and can t hold a grudge about how bad the village treated during his childhood        Naruto shows his best creativity spontaneously in the midst of combat not as profound grand plan strategy as in the case of Ne users such as Shikamaru  Kakashi  Jiraya etc  This can be seen with his ability to notice the chakra rods on the tailed beast  use of the sexy Jutsu against Kaguya and the reason every Jutsu he pretty learns has to be done kinesthetically e g  Jiraya had to throw Naruto into a pit before he understood how to access his nine tails chakra     Expectations about the future would be redeemed as goals rather than expectation  as the expectation is the act or state of expecting or looking forward to an event as about to happen  While the goal is a result that one is attempting to achieve  From here  it wasn t his expectation  The expectation would rather be realistic and measured by the capability while the goal is something distinct compared to the expectation  this is where expectation vs reality comes from the Si user      And people should mind that Se doesn t have the consciousness of the inner body but outer environment awareness  would be resulted to not realize of what was going on to the inner body  this would be the evidence of not even having Si in their stack  Si inferior would at least act to lessen their unhealthy manner  might as when they get stressed or else  The delusion of the past would be depending on the relationship between perceiving and judging function  Se  Si  Ne and Se are correlated to the past therefore it can t be good evidence of inferior Si  ,enfp
 he is forgiving and sees perspectives    i argue the opposite  he is forgiving but he is incredibly stubborn  he cant understand sasuke s motivation to kill itachi  he forces sasuke to stay when sasuke had all the reason to go  he can do anything if it meant that sasuke comes back  refuses to see he is with orochimaru  he attempted to kill killer bee  killed leaf s elder  tried to kill sakura  kakashi and nearly killed naruto   he refuses to see sasuke is a danger and he is in his stubborn little selfish perspective  where is his  other perspective  that thinks that sasuke chose that path  that peoples have entirely another perspective of sasuke   ohh  am i pissing off stans saying naruto is not perfect person     ,enfp
the whole meme with narutos talk no jutsu stems from wanting his enemies to see things from a different perspective  which screams ne usage to me  but his ne fi is most apparent around the time when sasuke was officially declared a criminal  he wanted everyone around him to see it differently because he didn t see sasuke for what he was and didn t want him to get harmed because he was his friend  that being said ESFP voters do have a point  this character loves his external stimuli,enfp
I DONT KNOW IF HE S ESFP OR ENFP HELP,enfp
I genuinely can t choose between ENFP or ESFP ,enfp
At least we agree on his enneagram  couldn t have that with sasuke,enfp
Classic Naruto was clearly limbic to me  but after shippuden he is calm ,enfp
First of all look at his adult self  he starts to use his Si inferior and Te child more than ever  ENFP ,enfp
He always needs a physical stimulation in everything  he wants to take action than to evaulate the ideas  He s impulsive like Se and Ne dom but his impulsiveness begins with acting he makes decisions afterwards ,enfp
Honestly most of this comments are underestimating Se     First of all  just because you are Se  it doesn t mean that you can t have long term goals  dreams nor think about the future  My dominant function isn t Ne nor Ni  but I knew since a kid what career I wanted to follow and I also had an idea of how I wanted my wedding to be  I also thought about my kids names and believe me  I don t want kids in the near future  just thought of it because I felt like doing it  it doesn t make me an intuitive  But I do struggle to follow plans that dictate how I should act in specific occasions  like having a routine  And that can be true for both Ne and Se functions   I have been practicing martial arts for   years now and it s normal to think about what to do while you fight  Taking decisions while fighting doesn t mean you are using that particular function  because that s what people do when they fight  The opponent can do       different things and unless you are always thinking about fighting or creating new techniques  which Naruto doesn t do  He creates new techniques  but not frequently  Se users can use their imagination and create new things too   you ll have to improvise  Therefore  you can t attribute a function to his fights  unless he does think about every possibility prior to fighting  which isn t true   His relationships with others and how he talks with them is  in my opinion  the best factor to help deciding what his MBTI type is  I have a lot of Ne friends and they are always changing topics and talking about random  interesting and weird topics  Most of the times it s about things and possibilities rather than actual  real stuff that is happening  I haven t seen Naruto talking about stuff like that  Even the speeches he gives to his enemies appeal more to the emotional side  only mentioning deeper things occasionally and moderately  which Se users can do too  ,enfp
Are we typing Naruto as a Ne dom just to go against the  ESFP shonen protagonist  cliche  Im not being incisive btw  I watched the show for the last time over   years ago  so I do believe he might have good Ne  but I gotta accept the Se voters also have good points  Both  inferior Si or Ni make a lot of sense in him  I see inferior Ni being a bit more on the face just because of his obssesion with Sasuke and his hardships accepting some obvious truths and implications about him,enfp
put Naruto and Deidara side by side and we can see a simple contrast between Ne dom and Se dom  while Naruto creates jutsus derivatives from his knowledge  with prudence and creativity  Deidara masters the forbidden jutsu of his village and becomes a terrorist  like a good evil Se user,enfp
he s such an NE   i love him,enfp
I haven t finished watching it so I m not going to vote just yet however I m going to leave a link to a post on insta by mistype investigator to see the difference between NE and SE   https   www instagram com p CN vyj hh p ,enfp
Fi makes sense  but Ne  pffff   he is future oriented   i honestly hate the bias,enfp
What cognitive function is it when people say you do what you want and not easily influenced by others  What cognitive function will that fall under ,enfp
His intellect makes him Ne dom ENFP not the pragmatic ESFP  His ESFP like behavior could be attributed to the persona he develops due to complicated childhood  His psyche is ENFP  and the mirror INFJ Messiah complex makes a lot of sense there ,enfp
If you look at every other ESFP shounen protagonist like Asta  Luffy  Natsu  you ll learn that all of them attack head on first  Naruto is different in the fact that he always tries to use talk no jutsu and tries to understand the villain  Se dom would express Fi through action while Ne dom would express Fi through words as a first reaction  This is clear especially in episode     of shippuden when Naruto speaks face to face with Nagato  Instead of easily defeating him and ending the attack on Konoha  Naruto tries to understand Nagato s pain and even offers to find an idealistic solution to it declaring that he will be the hero in Jiraiyas novel  This is what makes Naruto so beloved as a character  He inspires and encourages others with his talk no jutsu and words including characters like shikamaru  neji  Obito  Tsunade  gaara and even sasuke in the end  This is a common characteristic of ENFPs which is the ability to motivate and inspire others with their words  Whenever naruto fights  it s a clash of ideals and he always uses his Ne to try to understand why the enemy became as they are from their perspective  then Fi convicts him to talk to them and see the best in them ,enfp
The SE in Naruto is very  very developped and his also very impulsive   the NI inferior  We see that his reflexion and intuition are very weak because he does not think and live in the present   The FI aux make him very sensible and expressive ,enfp
Fun Fact  this is what Google thinks about Naruto s mbti  https   imgur com a PdduRhr,enfp
one misconception i want to clear   which i also had and i want to be clear about that   Intuition is not future focused function  Intuition is idea focused function   few peoples used to threw statements like  he is positive about future unlike intuition inferior   now this doesnt make sense because INFP and ENFP types are most likely to have depression  and depression is literally about  it will always be like this  it will never be better   here  peoples are almost connecting Intuition to progressiveness   like Ne inferior is scared of idea of something different  they are not scared of tomorrow  and Ni inferior are scared of idea of meaninglessness  so they act to make an impact   Intuition is speculative  guessing  theorizing what the object could have gone through and what might happen to it   and that is why naruto has inferior Ni  he rarely speculate  guesses and theoretical  Intuitive have easier time being in their head  theorizing  imagining ideas and daydreaming  Sensors have easier time interacting with reality  not overthinking stuff   EDIT  all right i am         leaving  i dont know what you guys are upto spamming on my notification  live in this fairy world believing naruto is ENFP  btw nice job fixing comments  i read his comment  weirdos,enfp
I would like to show some Differences between Se and Ne    Adapted from Carl Jung s Psychological Types                         Se                        Sensation  in the extroverted attitude  is most definitely conditioned by the object  As sense perception  sensation is naturally dependent upon the object  But  just as naturally  it is also dependent upon the subject  hence  there is also a subjective sensation  which after its kind is entirely different from the objective  In the extroverted attitude this subjective share of sensation  in so far as its conscious application is concerned  is either inhibited or repressed   For Se  the factor that makes a sensation really compelling is inherent in the object itself  Se is interested in things that roughly everyone  everywhere  would sense as real and concrete  and takes great enjoyment in experiencing them to their fullest   This type is mainly oriented by the concrete  objective world  that s why he s the GREATEST REALIST of any type  Since he s mainly interested in experiencing the material world concretely  he RARELY goes beyond it to speculate or hypothesise                          Ne                        Intuition as the function of unconscious perception is wholly directed upon outer objects in the extraverted attitude  Because  in the main  intuition is an unconscious process  the conscious apprehension of its nature is a very difficult matter  In consciousness  the intuitive function is represented by a certain attitude of expectation  a perceptive and penetrating vision  wherein only the subsequent result can prove  in every case  how much was  p        perceived into   and how much actually lay in the object   Just as sensation  when given the priority  is not a mere reactive process of no further importance for the object  but is almost an action which seizes and shapes the object  so it is with intuition  which is by no means a mere perception  or awareness  but an active  creative process that builds into the object just as much as it takes out   Since intuition  in the extraverted attitude  has a prevailingly objective orientation  it actually comes very near to sensation  indeed  the expectant attitude towards outer objects may  with almost equal probability  avail itself of sensation   Frequently he will even make use of the term  sensation   He actually has sensations  but he is not guided by them per se  merely using them as directing points for his distant vision                                                              on the replies I will explain why I think Naruto is ENFP over ESFP ,enfp
I ll start off with blanket statements and general traits and explain why in more detail below  Naruto is idealistic  imaginative  happy go lucky  curious about everything  always coming up with ideas  naive  scatter brained and doesn t pay attention to details in the moment and is slow to react  and is always asking questions all the time like Ne users are known for  and most importantly  he sees possibilities everywhere in life and thinks nothing is impossible to him  Now let me explain each point in depth and explain why for each one  Ok so when we re introduced to Naruto we see him with the class clown prank  ok you might think typical ESFP behavior ok fair point but ENFPs can like to prank too  Overall Fi users and Te users like to have fun with things and people and definitely EXFPs like having fun for the sake of it to address this point and percievers in general  especially EXXPs but no matter  this is a superficial point and not enough for either argument of ESFP or ENFP  the most I would say is Naruto is a clown because of having a scarred Si childhood but I don t want to discuss this too much since I have better examples I can give than this but I had to address it since its an obvious detail people see and mention so there you go  So let s move on to better examples  before I move onto better points lets get the obvious one out of the way  he wants to become Hokage and its his dream  no I know what your thinking  hey ESFPs can dream and have goals like that and your completely true and right about that  You can argue its an unrealistic dream and its Ne since Naruto is going after it anyway and even doing it for his Si past to prove himself to the village but someone could make a strong argument that an ESFP can do this too so I understand  so leave this point up in the air for now  I m gonna move onto stronger points and get this one out of the way since its a common point people mention all the time   Naruto is always curious about everything and is constantly asking questions  all of the time  I m kinda surprised Mara from practical typing didn t realize this but I can understand why since they take certain things and get fixated on them and miss other things as a result hence some in my opinion mistypes like Sasuke ESTJ I feel  which I strongly disagree with as most other people do  even if I respect their opinion of course at the end of the day  But back on point  Ne users and intuitives are always asking questions all of the time  especially Ne users  Naruto wants to go a real mission after doing boring tedious ones and wants to do something more challenging right as people remember  now when the Third Hokage concedes and gives him a better mission and says he s escorting someone  he gets really excited and then proceeds to ask  Who  Who  Is it a princess  A counselor  A feudal lord   This is Ne curiosity coming into play and asking questions all the time and being curious about everything around you  I think this is a common point people forget in Ne users  it s not just about ideas and imagination only  its always about asking questions all the time  Ne is all about asking questions and curiosity  so essentially one thing to look out for to type a Ne user is pay attention to how many questions they ask in the series and if your watching sub how many times question marks appear for that characters dialogue  If you see it all the time then that person is most likely a high Ne user and definitely a Ne dom or aux character  Naruto asks questions all the time and in that scene specifically Naruto said Who  over and over again then asked multiple questions in excitement on who they could be possibly escorting  this is all Ne coming out in him  He does this again when there on the boat talking about Gato and his company when he asks What  What  He does this constantly other times like when he wanted to know and ask questions about the dead people during the Kakashi Team   test  Naruto asks  Then  what kind of heroes are they   and then urges him to tell him the answer  this is all Ne in Naruto again and constantly asking questions to people about everything with his Ne    I couldn t put everything I think here  please check the Replies for more    ,enfp
QUESTIONS  why when naruto gets an idea  he instantly act it in Se reality   why has naruto so much problem being inside his head and theorize plan   why doesnt naruto ideate as default like Ne dom should    other than emotional stuff  when naruto gets an idea  why doesnt he takes an idea to form another idea like Ne dom    these questions must be answered before saying  naruto is ENFP   if he uses Ne for ideas  why doesnt he as Ne dom has to get beaten up to use intuitiveness ,enfp
I just wanna show how Naruto learned the First Phase of the Rasengan training with his Ne and Si  The way Naruto learned to finish and complete the first phase for the Rasengan was all Ne and Si   and it s incredible how he did  He couldn t do it and was struggling the whole time and then when he came out the room and saw a cat playing with a water balloon and hitting it back and forth with its paws from both sides and different spots on the balloon  eventually it popped and Naruto got an idea on how to pop the balloon with his Ne after using his Si by watching the cat before  He saw the cat and what it did in the past with his Si and then got the idea on how to break the balloon with his Ne and idea he came up with again   Now actually its not all that simple though  Naruto also gives us a detailed explanation on what he learned and how he came up with the idea in the first place  He explains his Ne and Si here in detail and here s I ll explain why based on what he said  We also see more Si in Naruto here in this scene because Naruto tells us here that another thing he noticed from seeing the cat hit the water balloon  that from seeing the cat hit the water balloon back and forth he realized that the water inside must be moving back in forth in different directions inside as well  from this Si observation Naruto remembered again with his Si that when Jiraiya showed him how to break the balloon the first time  the balloon got bumpy and was exploding from different directions inside like it was boiling he says here  But when Naruto tried it before it was all flowing in one direction and not getting anywhere at all and would never break that way   From Naruto seeing the cat hit the balloon in different directions and seeing it pop with his careful Si observation and memory  he thought even further back and compared this experience with seeing the cat with his Si and compared this situation with the situation in the past of Jiraiya demonstrating popping the balloon and Naruto failing at it the first time as well back then  All of this is Si careful observation and memory and comparing and contrasting current details and situations to past experiences and details from the past that happened as well  and Naruto did all of this right here in this one scene and then got the idea with his Ne on how to pop and break the balloon by figuring out he had to get the water moving in different directions inside the balloon to break it again  Which all leads up to the big Ne idea he came up with to do this by having one hand spin the water and using the other hand to pump chakra onto the balloon from the outside and make the water spin in different directions and eventually pop like he did from figuring out this amazing Ne idea from all these Si observations from the past he did here  Truly amazing moment and this is a MASSIVE Ne and Si moment in Naruto   This is a ton of Ne and Si in Naruto for sure coming out here and probably one of his best moments yet in the entire series  the amount of Ne and Si he uses here is off the charts and incredible  Jiraiya says it s a weird  strange  eccentric idea but hey he s a weird and interesting kid so its fine  Naruto is definitely a Ne dom and Si inferior user and ENFP for sure in my opinion again   And to top it off  Naruto sees the possibility to learn the whole Rasengan technique in a short amount of time with his Ne and definitely not in   years like Jiraiya said it took for the  th Hokage  and as we all know  Naruto does it in the end and fulfills his Ne possibility prediction and learns the Rasengan in a very short amount of time than usual just like he said would after hard work  determination  and coming up with the idea to use his shadow clones eventually with his Ne to pump the chakra in his hands and creates the unique abstract way he uses the Rasengan with shadow clones that we all know him for today as usual   Truly spectacular moments from Naruto here definitely  no doubt ,enfp
SEE as        Super good example of Se Ni in Socionics  He s very energetic  hard working  can be quite aggressive and assertive  he s always working on or towards something and doesn t value sensations for their own sake  craves power  etc  On the Ni end  his efforts are always targeted at some long term future goal he has assigned and never forgets this  he wants to become Hokage  he wants to save Sasuke  etc  ,enfp
i honestly dont see social    we never see him caring about his social status at all really  social   s are supposed to crave and thrive off of validation  but he doesnt gaf about what other ppl think of him and will just do whatever he can to achieve what he wants to  despite what others say  i think hes more of a sp   with his whole never giving up volition and in the sense that as long as he feels satisfaction in his own acheivements he ll be happy  just bc he wants to become hokage  which happens to be a social figure  doesn t necessarily mean he s an so  i could wrong tho  i just need someone to explain how naruto fits under being a social      instead of disliking this comment without any explanation how about you just answer my question  bye and they re also a sasuke ISFP voter damn double homocide,enfp
he s clearly an ISTP what are y all on,enfp
all Naruto characters have an MBTI battle Like Is Sasuke ISFP or INTJ  Is Sakura ESFJ or ESTJ ,enfp
     syaxi bwoi  voted Naruto as ISTJ because he just watched the episodes in which Naruto was trapped on the ISTJ s Subconscious     The Ni voters   aetosjayglaza     That guy from texas     Nubank  noticed Naruto s Ni but voted wrong because they didn t notice Naruto deals with his Ni inside the INFJ s Unconscious     Naruto also persuade villains by showing his Super Ego Persuader side  I really don t get why nobody noticed or even thought about this   If you didn t notice anything of it  it is because you didn t watch any of my videos   I recommend you check my videos about Type Grid    There is a fake C S  Joseph out there voting Naruto as INFJ  don t believe on him  It is not funny   Sincerely    C S  Joseph,enfp
Ok  ok   I see you all are having problems in identifying Naruto s mbti personality  but it is actually VERY clear for me   Sooner  I will provide my definitive analysis based on my original Type Grid  system   Sincerely  C S  Joseph,enfp
ne   while se gathers information via primary senses  ne identifies the theoretical  ne doms are more likely to focus on possibilities than se doms  who see the world for what it is through the   senses  this does not mean se makes you rigid  uncreative  or shallow  especially not healthy se  it simply means se doms are better at seeing what is rather than what could be  and that has its merits and its drawbacks   i don t think trying to discern ne or se from his fighting style is possible  because his fighting style changes so much throughout the series  on one hand  he struggles immensely in part   and clearly does not learn by doing  failing over and over no matter how hard he tries  is mostly ineffectual and a burden on his team until he meets jiraiya  an ENFP mentor   his one contribution in their first mission is his trick with the shuriken  something very spontaneous and out of the box in a way that could point to ne  but on the other hand  one of his biggest power boosts is sage mode  which is se to the core   ne   se only becomes clear if you take a look at his approach towards people  naruto sees the potential in everyone  for better and for worse  he snaps gaara out of his homicidal rampage by identifying with him  reaching out to him  seeing past his incredibly frightening behavior to what he could be  he inspires neji and countless others  on the other hand  his ne can make him sound borderline delusional  obito is a good example of this  he calls him the  coolest guy  which is meant to refer to a theoretical obito that hadn t been traumatized into becoming evil  but is still a weird way to refer to the guy who murdered your parents and thousands of others  naruto latches on to the theoretical to the point where he can be out of touch with reality  that is not the behavior of a se dom  not even an unhealthy one   fi   no one is debating his fi aux but i wanted to point out how it supplements his ne  ne doms often have an  open ended  approach to the world where they don t pass definitive judgement  they like to seek ways  around  a problem rather than confronting it head on  you see this in how naruto handles nagato and sasuke  trying to see nagato s perspective and interrogating him about his life  the lessons he takes from this knowledge  gathered through ne  are incorporated into his value system  same with sasuke  the practical thing to do is kill sasuke  but naruto seeks ways around it past the point of logic  his attachment to sasuke is a big part of his value system as well   te   the tert function is the  buried  function that is acknowledged but not prioritized  something you re afraid to express  naruto understands reality  he understands external logic  but it takes a backseat to his ne fi  and he s often frustrated by it or outright rejects it  the whole sasuke situation is an example of this  actually  comparing him to sasuke  you see how the latter s te   fi when he gathers facts and history from the hokages  going through a lot of effort to do so  and that shapes his value system  he abandons his previous  strongly held conviction that the village should be wiped out quite easily after his little history lesson  naruto notably does not abandon his value system  ever  even when te external logic threatens it   si   the main reason i type him as ENFP over ESFP is that i can t see inferior ni in naruto  inferior ni can lead to a fear of the future  to the point of avoiding contemplating it entirely  which is why unhealthy se doms often become extremely indulgent and hedonistic  it can cause someone to catastrophize the future  naruto does not do this  he generally expects the best possible outcome and has no problem looking to the future   his inferior si feels obvious though  he s not responsible  even as an adult  in the manga he actually tries to leave the hokage position to aid sasuke s mission  but sasuke says no  it was cut out of the anime  probably cause of how it makes him look  he struggles with detail and routine  he s absent minded  accidentally drinking spoiled milk  showing up late  waking up late and pissing off sakura  someone who loves routine  is probably esXj  at his worst and unhealthiest  he plays his bad memories on loop and tortures himself with them   si inf   He struggles to retain lessons from the past  let s remember the reason he failed on the genin exam a lot of times  he struggle to learn bushin no jutsu   i dont think ENFP typing here is intuitive bias  yeah  some people think se doms can t be subversive  but naruto  although i like him and he s easily my favorite out of team    is not a genius or revolutionary  he just has a lot of behaviors that don t strike me as very se ,enfp
i have had enough of this stupidity  even if you think his ideas are Ne ideas  he should not be Ne DOM   because in fights and life in general  his first instinct is not to ideate   his first instinct is not to find ideas  creating and checking possibilities  his instinct is not to hypotheses  guess   he does things as above only after he is beat up  aka when he enters his unconscious  he triggers it after his Se default fails   getting idea in any form is not Ne   there are other Se dom who are strategic  Tsunade is supposed to be more strategic tactical than jiraya according to databooks  jiraya is least smart sanin  Deidara despite of liking explosion knows how to press gaara down  Kisame is smart and strategic  Kiba is strategic  even Might guy was able to held on his   gates until madara whole war and he also thought of summoning turtle to fly   Madara who says he fights for fun  is strategic and careful  he suddenly becomes aware when guy  naruto and sasuke becomes too strong to handle   naruto getting idea is in form of seeing patterns in real world  not consideration of possibilities   many peoples point out how he doesnt fight for  experience  which i do agree with some extenct  but he also doesnt do something to cause unpredictible possibility  he doesnt do things to see the reactions  he doesnt want to see and observe ideate chaos Ne   he wants to be in chaos Se   he still liked to fight  he was waiting for his turn in chunin  he wants to fight sasuke  after OG naruto he had a character development  he became more wise    i recommend watching this AsuraPsych video   it not intuitive types are abstract  it s introverted type that are abstract   this is my point all along  naruto has intense Fi relation with peoples   and this can feel like a intuitive trait  around      he talks about how abstract Si s representation of reality is  in the same way Fi and his love for sasuke is very abstract  so this is not ENFP exclusive feature   around       he talks about how Ne is based on reality   that is they can physically point to as a reference to how they gets an idea  there is an real base to what idea originated from  that is why they can explain how they get an idea   laptop reminded me of cinema i used to go  i had a friend that paid for my tickets  he had a girlfriend who was wonder woman fan  gal gadot plays wonder woman   this is Ne  laptop to gal gadot  there is a way to explain how Ne gets idea  there is a link of real peoples and events   naruto has ideas like combining two kurama chakra to spread chakra of minato to teleport peoples  he cant explain how he got it  him getting multilayered plan to trick zabuza  there was no real basis to it  he cant explain how he gets it  he just gets it  these are examples of Ni    this is also video explaining Ni really well  Position of function is not that relevent for naruto and any anime in general because fictional character tends to be too inconsistent  naruto has many times equally good Ni and Se  but he prefers to be Se more than Ni    many people compare his openmind  positivity  him forgiving his empathy with ENFP  you could use these points if other type is in lower spectrum with these things  like if ESFP are known for being bit closeminded  negative  unforgiving and unempathetic  you could use these points  but ESFP and ENFJ which the debate is against are equally if not more  positive  openminded  forgiving and empathetic peoples   if you read till now  you know your a chad and openminded ,enfp
He is an INFJ Ni   he always thinks about future and has big dreams and goals  like his dream to be hokage and to take Sasuke home  He never gives up and always has a plan  This is the most Ni thing I ve ever seen Fe   he always thinks about others needs  not his own  His dream is to become hokage  I don t think I have to explain his Fe  it s so obvious Ti   his plans in battles are always very logical  so Ti Se   he always prepared for every situation  Sooo  Naruto is an INFJ,enfp
I think he is clearly ENFP  He could be ESFP because they really look like ENFP  but ENFP outweighs that  In Naruto  creative  future oriented  inspiring  sincere  strong imagination  confused and especially constantly acting on intuition are the dominant traits  ENFP wins by a large margin  Here I leave a description of ENFP so you can see that Naruto is clearly an ENFP   Exciting  passionate  emotional impulses that move others  have a mysterious power of intuition about impulses  bring life to life   passionate emotional impulses  filled with the desire to understand all the events that affect the lives of others  to seek the truth about people and issues  to move others with great persuasion  to inspire and motivate people to go all the way  to have an irresistible desire to talk about social issues one who thinks that life is the driving force  has a wide range and vast excitement  has an irresistible desire for innovations  wants to be fiercely independent  rejects any addiction  struggles with a sense of self confidence  instantly understands and reveals doubtful social impulses  capable of observation  English is not my native language  so forgive me if I misspelled it   Buraya ise T rkler i in Narutonun bariz bir  ekilde ENFP oldu unu g stermek i in bir ENFP tan m  koyuyorum   Ba kalar n  harekete ge iren  d rt ler hakk nda gizemli bir sezgi g c ne sahip olan  hayata hayat veren heyecan verici  tutkulu  duygusal d rt ler  Ba kalar n n hayatlar n  etkileyen t m olaylar  anlama  insanlar ve sorunlar hakk nda ger e i arama  ba kalar n  b y k bir ikna ile harekete ge irme  insanlar  sonuna kadar gitmeleri i in ilham ve motive etme arzusuyla dolu tutkulu duygusal d rt ler  Ya am n itici g   oldu unu d   nen  geni  bir yelpazeye ve engin bir heyecana sahip  yeniliklere kar   dayan lmaz bir istek duyan  son derece ba  ms z olmak isteyen  her t rl  ba  ml l    reddeden   zg ven duygusuyla m cadele eden bir ki i  sosyal meseleleri konu mak i in kar   konulmaz bir istek duyar    g zlem yetene ine sahip   pheli sosyal d rt leri an nda anlar ve ortaya   kar r ,enfp
When do you guys gonna realize he is INTJ  He is a CLEAR INTJ   Ni   Naruto developed a long term plan since the beginning  He used Ne and Se on the anime to confuse the Personality Database about him  You think you know Naruto  He is two steps ahead    Te   He acts strictly according to the plan during the episodes  Take in mind he was acting the whole time to confuse you    Fi   He feels     Se   He acts     The name of the Anime is Naruto because it was Naruto s show   ,enfp
saying   naruto doesnt want to fight for experience  for him not having Se is undermining whole OG naruto show   whole OG naruto he wants to fight  he was impatient waiting for his turn for a fight in chunin  he fights sasuke in roof top  ignoring possible consequences and long term effect  and nobody in right mind should want to fight for fun   character change their point of view because of journey they had  that is called CHARACTER ARC  he learns throughout OG naruto that peoples are not inherently bad  that is part of character development  he became more wise after timeskip   and naruto s relationships with peoples is meant to be mystical  that is writer s choice  Naruto was the leader in previous lives  so he will be people focused  he wants to save sasuke because he had bond with sasuke reincarnations after reincarnations  this doesnt make him ENFP  Characters often talk vague because they represent symbol  through those vague statement viewers know what they stand for   take jesse from breaking bad for example who is considered ESFP  he is highly empathetic and idealistic  he feels other s pain  he wanted future with jane  he doesnt do physical things for pleasure but relies more on drugs  hell he cannot even fight  and jesse and breaking bad is more grounded than naruto ,enfp
Very much an ENFP  he uses Ne in the most situations  Look at his jutsus and ideas  He is ideas over physical response ,enfp
jokes and trolling aside  i find it PATHETIC and uncomfortable that some of you use  he is empathetic   argument against ESFP voters  Go and learn about basic human nature   Get out and observe peoples weeps    Fi is process oriented unlike Fe which is result oriented  Fi wants to relate  compare and understand emotions  this is not at ENFP exclusive feature  THIS IS NOT ENFP EXCLUSIVE FEATURE   ESFP and ENFP both have Fi on second ,enfp

Naruto Uzumaki  ENFP    His Ne and Si explained in the Raikage Team Fight Scene  I just wanted to make this to point out Naruto s Ne and Si moments in this arc and this moment fighting the controlled Raikage with Temari and the group during the Ninja War arc  Let s begin   This first point I have mention even though this post is not about this scene  I have to mention it anyway since it happens is a good point  Naruto coming up with the idea to throw the Rasenshuriken from the back and teleporting from the front to catch it and teleport again in front of him and hit him that way as a good Ne moment  But no matter this isn t my strongly point at all  just a light mention so keep reading   Now I m going to explain Naruto s major Ne and Si moments in this fight  Both Si and Ni care about and think of the past but Ni is more wholistic and abstract and overall when it thinks back on past data and Si is more detailed with the past  holds onto it more and cares more about security and being safe with things  much more than Ni does or cares about  Naruto is being very safe and secure in this scene after his Rasenshuriken fails  when Naruto is not being reckless as a perceiver he cares for security and being safe with certain things very much as a Si user  Ni users can like to be safe but its a lot less personal for them and Si users like to be safe in a very personal way and care about being safe on everything which Naruto is showing here with his Si in this scene with wanted to check with Killer Bee and the   tails with something on his mind and Naruto s demeanor as a whole   Now to further explain  Naruto is using Ne here too in this scene  He s wondering and brainstorming beneath the surface with his Ne on how exactly the   tails gave him that scar on his chest  the possibility on how the scar got there from the   tails is what s weighing on Naruto s mind  I already explained above how Naruto wants to be safe and secure with his Si and check in with the   trails on how the scar got there in their in the first place  Naruto s Ne curiosity and wondering then asks the   tails about it and further asks how did he give him that scar on his chest  the   tails explains the story and says they were fighting and he used the tailed beast bomb and he thinks that how it got there  The   tails is unsure though and stumbles and struggles and hesitates when he s speaking and says  I think   maybe  Maybe not       tails  The   tails is unsure if the tailed beast bomb actually gave him that scar or not and just keeps explaining and explains how they both collapsed and fell forward while attacking in mid battle  he ends it off by saying I don t remember much beyond that showing further how forgetful he is on what actually happened in this scene  Naruto notices and pays attention to all this   Naruto then continues to brainstorm with Ne  wondering many possibilities in his mind while thinking hard on what the   tails said and then sees the pattern of his words and the Raikage and makes the connection with his Ne immediately after and figures out what really happened beneath the surface that day with his Ne  After Naruto sees this pattern and makes this connection with his Ne and is done brainstorming he has a flash of insight and figures out what most likely happened to give Raikage really that day  After he realizes what most likely happens  he says in his mind  Could it be     since he knows its still a hunch and prediction at the end of the day  his Si is still trying to be safe and secure again and thinks a little longer to make sure  And then as usual Naruto trusts his intuition  hunch  and prediction based on the idea he brainstormed earlier on what could have possibly happened and then again trusts his intuition and prediction on what possibly happened behind the scenes and beneath the surface and fully then commits to it and says  Thanks    tails   in his head again and proceeds to use his shadow clone jutsu and get started on his Ne  Naruto uses a ton of Ne and Si in this scene alone and over the course of these events and I hope you see why in my explanation above    To be continued on the replies    ,enfp
Naruto is EPFP  Pe Fi Te Pi   D,enfp
I think you guys are overestimating his  ne creativity  and going based off of stereotypes  especially the  he has goals  so ne  I think that can be better attributed to being a     He relies on the same techniques  shadow clones  rasengan  adapted to suit his environment  He modifies said techniques but never really makes something new  His philosophies in life are never really any grand revelations but rather basic principles instilled into him from the village  and from his mentor figures  primarily jiraiya     I would sooner believe ENFJ over ENFP because his  ninja way  is rather fe oriented  as is the whole story of naruto  A more fi themed story is one piece   However I dont think his ni or si are great  and he seems to use more se in his adaptable qualities    So many of the ne arguments here are quite frankly stereotypical  like I touched upon earlier  People with dreams and goals are not inherently high or good ne users  That would make most of us xnxp   which we arent  I suspect that may account for many mistypes on this site from users and on profiles but that s another discussion to be had     And my last note is that perhaps he was intended to be an ne dom style visionary with original and crestige insights  but that failed  I believe that s because kishimoto has questionable ne and isnt the best writer  Both naruto and kishimoto go on about the same redundant ideas with little innovation  That isnt to say that a lack of ne is not creative   but in these specific instances I believe so ,enfp
It s a hard one  he s almost equally using Ne and Se imo  but what determines my vote for now is the iconic Ne moments he has  they re very distinctive  One of my favorite is when he figures out a way to beat the third Raikage   ,enfp
i haven t seen a distinct se like hinata shoyo or luffy in naruto  these two are mostly who can do what needs to be done by relying on their instincts  but naruto doesn t look much like them  he struggled badly so much in his childhood that he was considered the worst in his class    naruto is a dreamer  an idealist but this is more on his own merits  even though sasuke doesn t want to return  he wants to bring him back  he already decides what s best for him  ithink the criterias he set for himself to become a hokage also make him a Fi way idealist  except this  inferior si makes ne doms easily get bored and want to switch to something else as soon as possible  because of he s  w   he wants success and recognition but while he is learning the jutsu with technical knowledge  he gets bored and wants to move on to the next one   the way he learned jutsu  in his own way and creative  also another effect of si inferior on ne dom cause in naruto learns techniques in his own way  not according to tradition or as learned in theory  for these reasons ENFP seems much more appropriate to me ,enfp
I haven t seen the series for a long time  so for all of you who type him I have general signs of what Se and Ne dom aren t  Signs someone is NOT a Se dom dislikes or has poor tolerance for physical sensory stimulation often contemplates implications  contingencies  or deeper meaning likes needs rules  naturally respects authority  avoids risky behaviour chases random or impractical ideas  ignores concrete evidence weaknesses of Se doms   have trouble grasping metaphorical  symbolic  or hidden meanings tend to overlook personal needs priorities because of excessive attention paid to external events difficulty seeing that their actions have wider or longer term implications difficulty understanding that making good choices involves carefully examining what makes behaviors existentially meaningful and significant rely too much on external sources for mental social satisfaction  often dislike being alone with themselves can appear impulsive  brash  or superficial to others Signs someone is NOT a Ne dom rarely has any new ideas  refuses to entertain new possibilities enjoys routine life  repetitive practice  and logistical planning must think through every little contingency before taking action unwillingness to dream big  no knack for big picture thinking Weaknesses for Ne dom  have difficulty with managing details carefully or learning methodically sometimes make faulty inferences or pursue unrealistic ideas tend to overlook personal needs or priorities because of excessive attention paid to external events can have tunnel vision when they are taken by an idea possibility do not invest enough in material stability or security difficulty understanding that making good choices involves methodically examining whether behaviors will actually produce real  tangible progress or personal improvement rely too much on external sources for mental social satisfaction On this site  people confuse free spiritedness and quick to action with Ne doms when those are clear signs for ESFPs  while ENFPs can become very bossy and analytical with their Te in the third position  I am not trying to type him  but I am trying to show misconceptions that I have seen in many arguments so far   Info has been taken by MBTI notes on tumblr ,enfp
He s very teasing with his friends  that s very NE dom    Naruto is not living in the present he s in his goals and dreams  in the future    He s also very good to find original strategies and jutsu  like his reverse harem jutsu  that s also very NE dom    some people are gonna say because he s good in combat and takes risk  he s SE dom but everybody can take risk doesn t mean you are SE dom    Usually people with NE are kinda bad with reading the room and they can be a little bit oblivious cause the are more in their head  less in touch with their environment  Naruto is very much like that     sorry for the mistakes  english is not my first language ,enfp
one thing i need you guys to be clear   kishimoto wanted naruto and sasuke s relationship to be mystical  the context itself is very magical like  they are brothers  and have bonds of generation after generations  life after life   and peoples are describing how naruto s feelings for sasuke is ENFP like  and Fi is very deep and can seem like intuition   and these mystical nature  having too much attachment  deep feeling are associated with XNFP  these are not much related to functions    now my head cannon  who am i swagkage and seththeprogrammer    someone pointed out to me how he might have  dissociative identity disorder   naruto has effects of his previous lives  and coincidently his previous lives were ENFJs       ENFJ are mystical  who wants to bring peoples together  Fe   can handle peoples very well  naruto mystical nature i think fit more ENFJ than ENFP   so ESFP is making more sense to me for now  he has infuence of ENFJ past so he has good control of Ni sometimes   haha,enfp
Guys can you tell me when y all finally choose a single mbti for him ,enfp
Omg I just wanna start with how much I kin him watching the show is like free therapy I love seeing someone with similar struggles to me overcoming them  ugh yesssss  Anyways  Naruto is CLEARLY an ENFP  Everyone says  oOoHhH mAiN cHarAcTer iN a ShOuNen AnImE He MuSt bE ESFP   But that is simply not true  Many fights he finds himself in he resorts to more strategic tactics over sheer athleticism  In the very first episodes we even see him STRUGGLING to understand moves that would come easy to an Se dom  He doesn t want to concentrate on the physicality  because he doesn t use the right functions for that to really interest him  His true strengths lie in coming up with multiple plans midfight to figure out how to beat his opponent  Not to mention his CLEAR inf Si  He is naive and forgets how people have wronged him  only focusing on the now and how to move forward with his goals  He doesn t think things through or reflect often  Now aux Fi  He prioritizes everything that means something TO HIM  like his feelings toward Sakura or his wanting to become hokage  without really stopping to consider anyone else s emotions  he charges forward with what he wants to achieve  tert Te  and has no time to tend to other people s emotions whatsoever ,enfp
Naruto being a Ne dom instead of Ni dom  Alright I know the post sounds weird since this is a Ne or Se debate  but a lot of ESFP voters use inferior Ni to justify their arguments  so i thought I d explain why naruto s intuition is divergent  Alright so after sasuke s fight with danzo he meets naruto    what naruto says is   we ll meet together in the afterlife sasuke     we ll die together        said this for the  th great ninja war     now this goes against every possibility imagined by naruto of him saving sasuke and bringing him back to konoha  uniting the shinobi nations  or becoming hokage  he promised that he wouldn t die till he became hokage  but this is what naruto tells     There are two things that can be understood from this     Naruto came up with this possibility of immediately meeting sasuke  he spent no time divinizing the idea  not Ni     Naruto s intuition is diverging and he was willing to abandon all those possibilities   This is also proof that naruto s talk no jutsu is Ne Fi rather than Fe Ni  Divergent instead of convergent  There are of course more examples but here s an interesting one    also a quote by jung showing that ENFP are impulsive   He seizes hold of new objects and new ways with eager intensity  sometimes with extraordinary enthusiasm  only to abandon them cold bloodedly  without regard and apparently without remembrance  as soon as their range becomes clearly defined and a promise of any considerable future development no longer clings to them   Carl Jung    eager intensity     seizes     enthusiasm   they re basically synonyms to being Impulsive LOL   His capacity to inspire his fellow men with courage  or to kindle enthusiasm for something new  is unrivalled  although he may have forsworn it by the morrow  The more powerful and vivid his intuition  the more is his subject fused and blended with the divined possibility  He animates it  he presents it in plastic shape and with convincing fire  he almost embodies it    Carl Jung  talk no jutsu  This attitude has immense dangers    all too easily the intuitive may squander his life    Carl Jung  another quote showing Ne dom can be impulsive and reckless,enfp
here are few signs of him acting like ESFP  Ni inferior  here he doesnt care about consequences and implication of his actions    taking risks such as letting person hit himself to get close   kabuto fight   shoving magical rod in his hand to find location of pain   of course pain fight   letting that chick hit him so she will forgive sasuke   chick is choji s wife apparently   attacking mindlessly a opponent alone when there is a strategic group in war arc is   fighting obito   being impatient while analyzing opponent in war  minato points out how naruto is impatient while camera points to sasuke analyzing    also not following rules  not being disciplined and not liking school is equally applicable to Ni inferior  peoples pointed out how he is not  traditionalist    they think Se doms must be traditionalist LOL  the question of him being traditional and non traditional was never the point of the show  this is making own narrative to prove a point   EDIT  with those points  i didnt mean  he is physical   i meant how they are done without thinking of their long term consequences ,enfp
a lot of people here are oversimplifying the ENFP arguments   what we mean by idealistic is that he is looking towards the possible outcomes of a situation than the situation itself  we are not saying that Se doms cannot be idealistic  rather the way that naruto possesses idealism is Ne  In the extraverted attitude  intuition as the function of unconscious perception is wholly directed to external objects  The intuitive function is represented in consciousness by an attitude of expectancy  by vision and penetration  but only from the subsequent result can it be established how much of what was  seen  was actually in the object  and how much was  read into  it  Just as sensation  when it is the dominant function  is not a mere reactive process of no further significance for the object  but an activity that seizes and shapes its object  so intuition is not mere perception or vision  but an active  creative process that puts into the object just as much as it takes out   The primary function of intuition  however  is simply to transmit images  or perceptions of relations between things  which could not be transmitted by the other functions or only in a very roundabout way  These images have the value of specific insights which have a decisive influence on action whenever intuition is given priority  But since extraverted intuition is directed predominantly to objects  it actually comes very close to sensation  indeed  the expectant attitude to external objects is just as likely to make use of sensation  Hence  if intuition is to function properly  sensation must to a large extent be suppressed   Just as extraverted sensation strives to reach the highest pitch of actuality  because this alone can give the appearance of a full life  so intuition tries to apprehend the widest range of possibilities  since only through envisioning possibilities is intuition fully satisfied  It seeks to discover what possibilities the objective situation holds in store  It is constantly seeking fresh outlets and new possibilities in external life  In a very short time every existing situation becomes a prison for the intuitive  a chain that has to be broken  For a time objects appear to have an exaggerated value  if they should serve to bring about a solution  a deliverance  or lead to the discovery of a new possibility Yet no sooner have they served their purpose as stepping stones or bridges than they lose their value altogether and are discarded as burdensome appendages  Facts are acknowledged only if they open new possibilities of advancing beyond them and delivering the individual from their power  Nascent possibilities are compelling motives from which intuition cannot escape and to which all else must be sacrificed    this is what we mean he is not looking at what is   seen   but the meaning of the object behind what he sees   this is just something i wanted to clarify  a Ne doms nature is philosophical  but don t simplify the argument to    He is Ne dom because he is philosophical   because it is the way in which he is philosophical that makes him a Ne dom,enfp
Yeah  I can see why Naruto is a being tied between ENFP and ESFP  After looking at the thread about mature ENFPs in the media  I noticed that one of the heroes or characters that was brought was Naruto Uzumaki and rather or not he is or is not a ENFP   but rather ESFP   They are both pretty similar but there are always some differences once you look closely at them I felt like a discussion should take place on which one he is because its been on my mind for a while because personally he seems more ENFP too me more then ESFP for a some reasons     He isn t a natural at all when it comes to majority of the different techniques   both ninjutsu and taijutsu in the beginning of the series   he struggled badly so much so that he was considered the worst in his class and one of the worst in the academy overall  a Se dom person from at least my own experience would not struggle that badly when it comes to learning how to do more simpler techniques Now I know some people will say that because he has no interest in school along with the fact that he can t pick up on theories does not make him a ENFP  I disagree due to the fact his disinterest shows the opposite  Most ENFPs dislike school or at least how school gives a almost one size fits all type of learning I think that is one of the problems with Naruto  he learns concepts differently from others  More hands on learning from his sensei  his master  and killer bee was what really help him advance as a shinobi  He was able to grab the concept faster when it was from mentors he respected and liked  while getting the general concepts on them  Both EFP types can learn through there bodies  I am somewhat like that at the very least      His ability to constantly trick his opponents during fights in a very unorthodox unpredictable  zany way  became one of his signature strengths throughout the series  Sexy jutsu anyone     Now I am not saying a ESFP would not be unpredictable and spontaneous in a shounen series   or maybe a fight real life    but its a different type of spontaneous   that is more wild  impulsive and at least a little more direct in nature  Take Monkey D luffy for instance   his fighting style is much more based of instinct and concrete   direct fighting  then Naruto s  Not saying he doesn t plan what he does next   his fights against Crocodile CP  New fishman pirates  Ceaser  Doflamngo etc shows that he does it fact strategies  but that Luffy doesn t have a  set up  type of fighting style that Naruto has   I know different series  but still   along with the fact that his unpredictability is more simple but effective  with a side of humor at times due too how simple and funny his forms look at times    On top of the fact that Luffy still rushes the crap at everyone no matter how strong they are something Naruto barely does as the series progress  after training with Jiraiya his own unique fighting style comes into its own     Its only when Luffy runs out of stem or faces a opponent he cant beat is when he realizes that he is about to take a L and or there is nowhere else to run   inferior Ni   while Naruto would have noticed much earlier but would still keep the hope alive   dominate Ne        I can go even further with the differences Luffy  ESFP  has such as the fact of how they reach their goals  Naruto didn t want to become hokage if he could not save Sasuke because of the meaning behind the friendship they had and what hokage meant to Naruto  he has such a Idealistic outlook when it comes too his dreams because physically he could of easily become hokage if he defeated sasuke without changing him but that not something he wanted because of his idealism and the value he has for his best friend  On the other hand Luffy simply CANNOT become Pirate King without his crew   he even admit himself that its impossible  even the Pirate King  himself had a crew  that conquered the seas and found the One Piece   along with the true history of the world  Luffy does deeply value his crew members  in fact he loves them like family    too bad Luffy x Nami will more then likely happen though lol   If Zoro or Sanji kept pulling a Sasuke on Luffy   I think Luffy would have gave up on them eventually   but he would not kill them    Naruto s idealism  his values and his lonely past cause him to keep going after Sasuke  more Ne Fi and Si vibes from me   ,enfp
Everybody knows its cool to call Naruto ENFP but we have to be objective but even though that s true  I agree because that s what he is  Naruto is ENFP for me  At least in my opinion like many others  Naruto is imaginative  sees possibilities everywhere  comes up with ideas all the time  curiosity is everything to him and he s curious about everything with his Ne is always asking questions all the time  He hates details with his Ne Si axis and is very future oriented all the time with his Ne  He s extremely idealistic and holds onto the past in unhealthy ways with his Si inferior  like    wanting to save Sasuke and blaming himself for failing to do so     wanting to keep his promise to Sakura of saving him no matter what at all costs and    keep trying to learn the kage bushin a lot of times even if it was actually the jutsu he struggle the most to learn  Si inf signal    His Ne sees the possibility of saving Sasuke at all times and he wants to achieve his Hokage dream  Major dreams for life is not only related to Ni  I hate when people argue and say one goal in life   Ni  this is untrue and completely false notion the MBTI community made up on their own  I m an Ni dom I know  I m an INFJ and have multiple goals in life  my ENFP best friend has had one goal in life plenty of times that he strives for  so please stop this bad stereotype which isnt even a stereotype  its just false information  Ne is about many possibilities and Ni sees a few or one  its not about how many goals in life you have  theres more differences they have than that of course but I m not gonna get into it now  But anyways Naruto yeah he s ENFP in my opinion   I also made a time ago some posts on reddit explaining why I think Naruto is ENFP  A more in deep analysis   My Naruto ENFP Post Part    Characterization and Zabuza Arc    My Naruto ENFP Post Part    Chuunin Exams and Naruto vs Neji Fight Ne vs Si clash of ideals  values  and views    My Naruto ENFP Part     of How Naruto used Ne and Si to learn the first phase of the Rasengan    A Naruto post I agree with    Great Naruto ENFP video and discussion on his type in general ,enfp
Really changed my mind a lot with him because he s untypable and let me explain why  This dude is ESFP ENFP ENFJ all in one  but if i look at the main fucntions ESFP ENFJ come to closed   Si  inferior fits the best but it s about his main functions and real weakness so let s start with that   Ti  blindspot fit the absolute best and it s clearly why he doesn t understand a lot when it comes down to Ti   But i don t want to stereotype EXFP are types that easy for me to hang out with and they are often pretty smart  Believe it or not got with a ESFP with a pretty high IQ  I still think it fits the best for him   Being Ti  his weakness   This guys functions come across as Se Ni Fe Fi  low Si  to me  lot of extroverted Sensor    Feeling functions   High Ni what makes ESFP ENFJ the most close  Se Ni Fe Fi  the big winners   People will probably think where do you see Fe   To begin with his goal  Ni   and where the desire vomes from  it s from his past  Si  but traumatic   intense childhood can still very much stay with you even with Si  blindpsot can relate myself   It s his desire to be respected and loved by other people to become a person that has to be respected in that way  Fe   Also the way he talked to Pain and Gara was really Fe Fi Ni for a couple of reasons one part could he relate was the though childhood he had himself  Fi  But it wasn t everything his sympathy and empathy was real   Fe  He dived into the story and looked for better outcome for a better future with deeper meaning and possibility to change their mind and way  Fe Ni  His Fe  was also clear in the quest to find Sasuke even when he became evil  he tried to change his mind and had the best intensity  that was not because of relatability or his own emotions values because he broke his values to begin with   On the other hand is his Se Fi really visible i think it s also in his actions when he become angry or when he takes actions  It s often in the moment and he doesn t overthink the strategy or what if  Ti blindspot  but goes by his own emotions and values  Fi   and he s handeling really good in the her and now  taking action doing what he can in the moment  Se     At least for his age   This is really especially visible in fights and having a relationship with a ESFP  can i assure you this is more of an ESFP thing   Also correcting people against actions of their norms and values   So i think he s probably between ENFJ ESFP but i am more towards ESFP even when Si  inferior looks like the best fit but again  Though traumatic childhood will stay in you re memory even for a ENXJ so ofcourse you will take those things with you in the future   So i find ENFP the least fitted  but you can leave a message about you re point if you disagree ,enfp
Blah ENFP    Bleh ESFP    Naruto is INTJ   Ni   Naruto developed a long term plan since the beginning  He used Ne and Se on the anime to confuse the Personality Database about him  You think you know Naruto  He is two steps ahead    Te   He acts strictly according to the plan during the episodes  Take in mind he was acting the whole time to confuse you    Fi   He feels     Se   He acts     The name of the Anime is Naruto because it was Naruto s show   ,enfp
i would like to request all voters to be civil and respect each other  keep arguments within the profile and not spread hate  there is a guy who is making assumptions about me  mentioning me in another thread to insult me  if you disagree you can reply  say where i am wrong at  not bashing me in another thread  that just shows your incompetence in the topic nothing more  i was already over this naruto thing  i was getting headache trying to get my point across   and no i am not this shh   guy   if we have same points to be made  that doesnt make me another person  then and might be same person as well because   they both think naruto is ENFP  ,enfp
  people really voted         ISFJ tf,enfp
Jesus I came back and ENFP votes are in the lead by around      After all this time of ENFP and ESFP teeter tottering  are we actually getting an edge on one side ,enfp
if you guys think you go soo deep into a character  go deep into functions as well  that is my original point   him being idealistic  unrealistic   future focused   optimistic are not functional arguments  they are vague  dont say  go to this guy comment who did detail dive    gives intuition feature and automatically assumes that Ne  go deep dive there  it could be Fi paired with another intuition   i ask  if you want to talk about inferior function  talk about his persistence to achieve one thing  Ne wants to explore not be hooning in one thing   they answer  it is because of his Fi   but ESFP also have Fi   you dont need to over complicate soo much  focus on what story is about  what is naruto introverted perceiving persistent about  possibility of being hokage and sasuke  Ni   what is naruto extroverted perceiving wild and unpredictable about  his physical capability  Se    naruto is not known for being long term strategist  naruto is known for his unpredictability in mid of battle  he is not known for his unpredictability in strategic conceptual realm  shikamaru is like that   Ne user kakashi s fighting involves his experimenting  jiraya s fight shows his Si   now tell me how do i put his Fi Te and Ni Se  so it just fits naruto  is he ENTJ INTJ ISFP ESFP  this ESFP POV   now a little experienced person might say  his Se and Ni is quite balanced  it really fits the positions of secondary and tertiary  this brings ENTJ  ENFJ  ISFP  ISTP  now note  naruto pretty often shows ability to Fe  so peoples assume ENFJ fits the most  ENFJ pov   naruto shows ability to have really intuitive  out of the world ideas  which can be explained as good Ni   and he behaves like ENFP many times  he is  idealist  in NF temperment sense  he is intuitive and he has high Fi  so ENFP ENFP pov   and i see a lot of problem with last one because from comments i see  i get impression that many of you dont know about Ni  his Ni is boosted by Se  Se finds detailed photographic view of actual world  and Ni finds pattern within it  he makes creative plan that is completely original plan Ni   also someone shared some info from databooks or something that said  he has ability to see things many other miss  indicative of good Se   Ne takes a system  breaks it down  diverging   tries to find where the system would fail   Ne boosted by Si is like jiraya s  constantly assuming  comparing  based on past events and knowledge he collected  but inexperienced Ne dom will try to experiment various possibility to collect datas  kakashi fights    you might say naruto gets beats and wakes up  isnt that Ne because he learns from it  nope  Ne doms experiments are intentional and very careful  after analyzing they make a plan  now plan is not natural to Ne  so then there comes Si  and how is Si  rooted in real experiences  so Si plans are really predictable  especially when there is not a pool of experiences   i know it is all useless you are not changing your mind   i dont know of some person who actually knows these things reply me  but there is apparently none ,enfp
Se and Ne can be similar as they can be a distracted sort moving from one experience idea to the next  For the Se it is obvious why they have changed course  They have exhausted an actual experience  But the Ne is finicky  as we see with Naruto learning Ninjitsu  Ne deals in ideas and potentials  rather than what is  ENPs like Naruto get bored with an idea before actualizing it  They move on to the next thing before anyone quite understands how they can be bored without actually doing it  It is why growing up it is so hard for him to learn Ninjitsu  The physicality isn t really natural  it doesn t come to him as his mind wanders with Ne  He moves on to the next more interesting thing before actualizing the first lesson   Naruto appeals to others about what could be in the Ninja world  His philosophy is shaped by Fi  not Ne  His Ne helps him see potentials and Fi directs him to see them in people  As he is guided by others and sees the world with Ne  his Fi takes shape his personal morals and philosophy  What he judges to be right  Ne is not a function that does this  The Ninja world forgets the people  the individual people  It puts the society above all  ironically forgetting the individuals  His actions and words inspires those who meet him  and remind them of what they all can be  That is one of the reasons why Se is more pragmatic and grounded  Words I would never use for Naruto  Naruto is a dreamer  an idealist  To quote Lenore Thomson     Like Extraverted Sensates  ENPs can make things happen very quickly  Sensates  however  are concrete pragmatists  They actualize people s expectations and in the process become to focal point  By contrast  the ENFP analyst appeals to people s imaginations  becoming a focal point for others  inventiveness and curiosity   Now Ni  being associated with his dream to be Hokage isn t really how inferior Ni works  Inferior Ni when healthy helps the ESP recognize that their own experiences can be interpreted differently and aren t compatible with everyone  It helps the ESP understand alternative viewpoints that run counter to the specific ESP experiences and ways of life  If the Ni is under developed they see other perspectives and interpretations as a threat to their sense of self created by their experiences    I don t see this inferior function working it s way in Naruto  However  I do see inferior Si  Naruto doesn t understand the need to stick to older values created by past experiences  He finds old rules constraining  This is his Ne Si conflict  His Ne sees that if something doesn t work  you move onto something new  He misses the need to honor certain needs and values under all circumstances  It is why many of the problems of the Ninja world make no sense to him  The meaning and perspectives based on experience  grounded in history  don t super appeal to Naruto  Just change  just adapt  just Ne  It is his coming to terms with the old and the new that drives Naruto s journey  He can t realize being Hokage till this conflict is resolved ,enfp
Agree on ESFP Naruto but using his brief moments of creativity in fights as a sign of his  Inferior NI  does not make sense  that s not what it does  I see Inferior Ni in how insanely short sighted he is    There s a good argument a couple posts down about Ne being evident in how he tries to see everyone s perspective  but IMO he only does that with people who personally connects to  like Sasuke and Gaara  It s not that he s naturally invested in gathering info about people the way a ENFP would be  he s actually very stubborn and hardheaded with people like the Raikage  It s just his strong Fi and unwillingness to back down on saving specific people  With Neji he didn t aim to inspire him by seeing his perspective  it just sort of happened without him having to intentionally seek out Neji s POV  which is fine because his POV was toxic at the time   The one exception was Nagato but that s      Jiraiya s influence  he s an ENFP that encouraged Naruto to create world peace by incorporating everyone s perspective  so naturally he d try to figure out what turned Nagato into a war criminal rather than just executing on sight  ESFP with a strong influence from a Ne dom mentor makes sense to me ,enfp
i dont know how i am supposed to take some of you seriously when first words that come out of writing is  he is future focused  he is idealistic  he is optimistic  etc etc  straight out of   Personality dot com dichotomies  dismiss those arguments ,enfp
I m just watching the fight between Naruto and Sasuke and I m so depressed by it  I always thought that these two are so similar and I m right Naruto is a  w  fit to him as he is such an out going kid and while Sasuke is  w  which makes total sense they are very similar but also the opposite of the other  they are the same coin just each one take each size,enfp
He is the reason why I changed my type  But why SEE SLE  He has SO much Socio Fe that he is a textbook Sle by now,enfp
AHAHAHAH BUT GUYS HE IS ESFP    SE FI TE NI USERS,enfp
commenting this again  literally whenever naruto is in battle his se ni shows so prominently i don t know how you all can t see it  i m still rewatching naruto completely since it s been awhile since i ve seen it in full  however even I can see it  during his fight with neji in the chunin exams  he used his ni to come up with attacks and stay one step ahead of neji  while his se still allowed him to be aware of what was going on in the current moment and stay on guard  naruto s ni is definitely there even though it s inferior  he s insanely smart but a blockhead at the same time  he just doesn t know how to use his ni all the time  which makes sense considering it s inferior duh   i think all you ENFP voters need a rewatch session cus   ESFP is clear as day  feel free to reply with any counter arguments  however i doubt that my mind will change  also  note that inferior functions are REPRESSED not UNUSED  he is also a   core  so of COURSE he s constantly going to keep talking about his main goal of becoming hokage   edit  i commented this about a month or two ago and i have finished rewatching completely  i stand my ground and still believe that ESFP is the best fit for naruto ,enfp
Stop typing everyone an intuitive type just cuz they re gay  ,enfp
 he is future focused  Noooo    he is idealist  Nooo    he doesnt follow rules so inferior Si noo   it can be even more Ni inferior Nooo    it s not like creativity is exclusive to Ne but      gives creativity examples to saying creativity is Ne    Nooo  they didnt come from knowing concepts and breaking down   says  Se is ultimate realist  how would   year old know what is real and what is not  in the world where there are all kind of magical peoples   peoples are soo much on going on about inferior function  but it is never addressed the fact that how Ne supresses Si  how does he ignore reality Si for Ne possibility  infact he fight against the madara who wants to trap peoples in dream world  exact opposite   on other end  he many times make rash decisions  Se focused  without taking look at possible consequence  Nx focused    talk about how introverted perceiveing consistent he is  how driven he is rather than focused on exploration   every step of his life is making his goal Ni to Se reality   look at jiraya  an ENFP  what does he do  he explores  Ne   he experiences  Si    he writes stories  converting real into unreal   yes i kind of think this is stretch but it is like all of ENFP arguments   naruto is not ENFP or ESFP or ENFJ  he act like all of them   but purely in terms of functions he is ESFP with weirdly good Ni OR or ENFJ with really good understanding of himself and self identity   i know some of you ENFP will be butthurt  but there are certain things you guys are bad at and ESFP are naturally good at those things  Se being one of them  i am not trying to say you cant walk or something  but naruto is god of physical improvisation  that is why he is known as unpredictable knucklehead   but conceptually what is naruto most comfortable with  human emotions and hokage position  that is it   he is dumb in other conceptual topics   as ENFP he should prefer more analytical approach  Ne Te and experienced Si is beast   open ended with life goals  Ne   better verbally in conditions like debates    i know ya all hate me  you can downvote and leave  if you have actual arguments and defence to above points  you can reply  just dont give random links  i want your understanding of functions  and how it applies to him  because sites description are general description and are not that detailed  sending links wont make me get your points ,enfp
Oh so he is ENFP again damn he s different every week lolz,enfp
Although I could vote either way at this point and do agree that both sides have very compelling arguments  can the ESFP voters stop accusing the ENFP voters of stereotyping  A lot of the ESFP comments are just asking  where s the Ne  or that the ENFP voters are just  biased towards intuitive types  when there have been so many great and compelling arguments everywhere for Naruto being an ENFP   as well as for ESFP  of course  but that s not the point     If you re wondering  I voted ESFP since I ve decided to change my vote to the type with less votes because again  I could see either way  ,enfp
This is coming from a new Naruto fan so please be nice  Also keep in mind that I haven t seen Shippuden yet so things could change and I ll have no idea  I ve been thinking about Naruto s type since episode   of the original anime   It s as simple as Naruto isn t one for looking at the details  Not really all that observant in battles like an Se dom would be  Gon from Hunter x Hunter is a great example of an ESFP shonen protagonist  Naruto has a very future focused mindset  Whether that s wanting to be Hokage or learning a new jutsu  He s so focused on the goal  he forgets to think about how to get there  You can also look at the way he fights  Naruto s the type to just throw out new idea without really giving them a second thought and it works  That s intuition  Yes  you can also say it s impulsiveness  a common Se trait  but you also have to realize that he s a kid  Of course he s gonna be impulsive  I also want to point out Gon s fighting style  Gon is one to observe and adapt rather than come up with idea after idea like an Ne dom would  Like Naruto would  May I also mention Si grip  In times of high stress like   a friend has run away  What does he do  He hyper focuses on the task of getting him back  Rather than Ni grip which is more likely to be pessimistic about the situation   I could be wrong about all of this  but I think the evidence of Naruto being an ENFP stacks up more than him being an ESFP  I m open to civil debates ,enfp
Yeah  so far ENFP arguments have been     times more compelling,enfp
Because Naruto is communist  and clearly Si inf ,enfp

Naruto has gotta be an ISTJ  He s introverted from his years of isolation  and is a loyal addition to any team  He might not be the most serious one  but I think that s because his functions aren t fully developed  He s loyal and has a goal that he relentlessly pursues no matter what  Naruto is actually quite smart and calculating  he just hides this side of himself from us and the mangaka ,enfp
I just wanted to share this AMAZING post I found on reddit  https   www reddit com r mbti comments onkd   why naruto is ENFP instead of ESFP    i think this was made by   victorcorcos   but I didn t realize until someone commented about it  my bad  it s so clear a lot of time and research was put into this  well done  ,enfp
Too much obvious Ne to be an ESFP   Just because he is impulsive doesn t make him a Se user ,enfp
what i see is people already deciding him as intuitive   he is future focused   he is empathetic so intuitive   he is creative so automatically Ne   he is restless so EXXP  so much biases  you guys already eliminated half of options before looking at functions   LOOK AT THE FUNCTIONS FIRST         he could be intuitive or sensor  and you dont need to overly complicate things   what i see is  Se  being really comfortable with being physical  it is his go to strategy  Ni  rigid and singular goal he wants to achieve  creative singular ideas Fi  wants to prove himself  tend to act with emotion than head  Fe  sometimes really good with other s emotions  good emotional intelligence   above analysis i think eliminates any high XXTX types that is no Ti or Te on top two functions   let s elaborate  what is naruto s go to strategy  which will be his default  going at it straight head to head   is there a skill or a routine ritual based approach  Si     NO is there a calculative  observational approach  Ni     No is there a comparision  experimentation with possibility aspect  Ne      No is he comfortable in physical situation and confident to head on directly   YES     what does this shows   in his fights  what was his default        Se  this brings us to one of the XSXPs or ENXJ  as we eliminated Tx function in top two  he must me ISFP  ESFP or ENFJ   i didnt eliminate ENFJ because ENFJ can be incredibly Se focused  as extroverted  introverted function can be repressed  he can be in Fe Se loop  and ENFJ have Ni aux   naruto from the start is very self focused    i am ignored    I will become hokage so people will notice ME   he is saying I am underdog  I will prove myself  this is very common Fi trait   Ni his goal  it is all he talks about  everything in life leads to this one event  from age of    he declared he wants to be a hokage  his Ni comes when his initial Se doesnt work in a battle  then he somehow has a plan  nobody and even he doesnt know how he got that plan  this is sign of Ni  Ni look at environment and finds a sequence or pattern and understands the system and have a plan  this is not to be mistaken with Ne  which is possibility check  comparision with past  brainstorm ideas eliminating them   final verdict he is ISFP or ESFP  ESFP fits more so   ESFP  now dont get started with Ni inferior shouldnt be that strong    ENFP voters should look under your nose and see they put Si on their inferior  naruto as a character has great problem with intuition element    as i said his understanding of being hokage is one dimensional at the start  it was a tool for him to be noticed    he wants attention right now  so he pranks  he doesnt consider it pass that    he constantly dives on a danger not thinking what could happen  too wild  he is being scolded over and over again for being too rash    he has problem being static and be contemplative    he is incredibly restless   ESFP s abilities he has   incredibly optimistic   energetic    deep consideration for emotion and humanity   loyal to friends   forgiving   ability to take a lead   creative   atuned with self body to pull off highly physical tasks    incredibly confident with his physical abilities    fast learner    curious   wanting to act idea immediately  why not ENFP  first of the all Ne Si axis  naruto is not guy to experiment with multiple things and jumping one future idea to another  he is incredibly pushy with his goals like Ni like gamma quadra peoples  that one idea is soo important to him  his fighting styles doesnt have element of disciplinary routined approach  Si peoples are highly techincal fighters  look at jiraya fight  so much comparision  trials and tribulations  comparision  elimination to get a result  naruto is not like that  Si inferior makes them want to avoid physical confrontations  makes them skip over details  kind of lazy  want to do experiment and not stick with one thing  following through idea is so difficult to them  because there lies an amazing possibility waiting to be discovered  Ne dominanant makes them expremely curious but what does he want to know besides being hokage huh  what does he ask to legendary ninjas like kakashi and jiraya  who will have wildest stories  besides wanting to learn jutsu that will help him reach Ni goal   he is ESFP with weirdly frequent good Ni as he is fictional character after all   STOP it with this  he is future focused   he is idealist   he is too unrealistic  arguments  they are too stereotypical   that is it my ranting and some of my knowledge about functions   you are welcome to downvote and not respond like a        see ya,enfp
At this point i wouldn t be surprised if he was both ENFP and ESFP,enfp
i m gonna have to go with ENFP  but i hope everyone knows this is not a kinnie vote  i ve got good te si  i think most ENFPs that have matured normally past the age of    probably do  and this character has not seen a drop of either in his life   ne   while se gathers information via primary senses  ne identifies the theoretical  ne doms are more likely to focus on possibilities than se doms  who see the world for what it is  this does not mean se makes you rigid  uncreative  or shallow  especially not healthy se  it simply means se doms are better at seeing what is rather than what could be  and that has its merits and its drawbacks   i don t think trying to discern ne or se from his fighting style is possible  because his fighting style changes so much throughout the series  on one hand  he struggles immensely in part   and clearly does not learn by doing  failing over and over no matter how hard he tries  is mostly ineffectual and a burden on his team until he meets jiraiya  an ENFP mentor   his one contribution in their first mission is his trick with the shuriken  something very spontaneous and out of the box in a way that could point to ne  but on the other hand  one of his biggest power boosts is sage mode  which is se to the core   ne   se only becomes clear if you take a look at his approach towards people  naruto sees the potential in everyone  for better and for worse  he snaps gaara out of his homicidal rampage by identifying with him  reaching out to him  seeing past his incredibly frightening behavior to what he could be  he inspires neji and countless others  on the other hand  his ne can make him sound borderline delusional  obito is a good example of this  he calls him the  coolest guy  which is meant to refer to a theoretical obito that hadn t been traumatized into becoming evil  but is still a weird way to refer to the guy who murdered your parents and thousands of others  naruto latches on to the theoretical to the point where he can be out of touch with reality  that is not the behavior of a se dom  not even an unhealthy one    fi   no one is debating his fi aux but i wanted to point out how it supplements his ne  ne doms often have an  open ended  approach to the world where they don t pass definitive judgement  they like to seek ways  around  a problem rather than confronting it head on  you see this in how naruto handles nagato and sasuke  trying to see nagato s perspective and interrogating him about his life  the lessons he takes from this knowledge  gathered through ne  are incorporated into his value system  same with sasuke  the practical thing to do is kill sasuke  but naruto seeks ways around it past the point of logic  his attachment to sasuke is a big part of his value system as well   te   the tert function is the  buried  function that is acknowledged but not prioritized  something you re afraid to express  naruto understands reality  he understands external logic  but it takes a backseat to his ne fi  and he s often frustrated by it or outright rejects it  the whole sasuke situation is an example of this  actually  comparing him to sasuke  you see how the latter s te   fi when he gathers facts and history from the hokages  going through a lot of effort to do so  and that shapes his value system  he abandons his previous  strongly held conviction that the village should be wiped out quite easily after his little history lesson  naruto notably does not abandon his value system  ever  even when te external logic threatens it   si   the main reason i type him as ENFP over ESFP is that i can t see inferior ni in naruto  inferior ni can lead to a fear of the future  to the point of avoiding contemplating it entirely  which is why unhealthy se doms often become extremely indulgent and hedonistic  it can cause someone to catastrophize the future  naruto does not do this  he generally expects the best possible outcome and has no problem looking to the future   his inferior si feels obvious though  he s not responsible  even as an adult  in the manga he actually tries to leave the hokage position to aid sasuke s mission  but sasuke says no  it was cut out of the anime  probably cause of how it makes him look  he struggles with detail and routine  he s absent minded  accidentally drinking spoiled milk  showing up late  waking up late and pissing off sakura  someone who loves routine  is probably esXj  at his worst and unhealthiest  he plays his bad memories on loop and tortures himself with them  he struggles to retain lessons from the past   last thing i wanna say  i dont think ENFP typing here is intuitive bias  yeah  some people think se doms can t be subversive  but naruto  although i like him and he s easily my favorite out of team    is not a genius or revolutionary  he just has a lot of behaviors that don t strike me as very se  but if there s a countargument  i have no problem hearing it ,enfp
y all say he s an ESFP and then go on to explain the ENFP personality based off of stereotypes about the ENFP personality  I m an ENFP and personally I really like action and I m quite action driven  I m impulsive  I m not necessarily creative I m also goal oriented and if I really want something  I will achieve it  Let s keep in mind the reason why Naruto wants to become hokage  seems very Ne Dom with Fi Aux to me     ,enfp
Mabel is the blueprint of an ENFP  Mabel is heavily imaginative  creative and is always thinking about other wonderful possibilities  Throughout her speech  she is really creative  coming up with unique and funny one liners  Apart from that  she is open minded  often absent minded  and is interested in new ideas as well  She pulls off some crazy ideas and is guided by novelty  able to put things together and making things very creative  Finally  Mabel is often very bubbly and energetic  This proves she is clearly a Ne Dominant user  because she does all these to interact with what s around her  which is one major way how the dominant function works    It is also clear she uses Fi over Ti  Mabel believes that expressing something out is helpful and she herself  is so focused on her beliefs and is emotionally honest about what she thinks  I wouldn t say that this is as strong to be her dominant  because although she can be emotionally honest  Fi  she is guided by novelty and what is new  Mabel is rather so into new ideas and often pulls off something new  To continue with her Fi  Mabel s focus is on the emotions of hers and for whatever feels right for her  morally  She does not follow logic and if something makes the most logical sense   Ti ,enfp
Can anyone axplain her AP typing ,enfp
literally THE ENFP  w   The little glimpses into her mind that we get are insane mish mashes of random concepts that she s subconsciously collected  and even that one sugar trip she has in the haunted convenience store has the mascots of the candy combined with THE most random sh t and it absolutely REEKS of Ne  If there s anyone I ever need to point to as an example of an Ne dom in fiction  it s easily gonna be her ,enfp
She likes to have fun  I can say that it reflects a completely adventurous personality type  Wing   effect  they are very attached to their loved ones   w  don t like to show it  even if they re worried  I was able to observe this in Mabel  An optimistic person is extroverted intuitive  Type  s are already in the emotion part of the thought center  they first feel the emotion and then they start to think  She wasn t very organized and lives spontaneous  That s all for my analysis  thanks for reading  ,enfp
I found this ESFJ argument to be fairly convincing  feel free to discuss  typing  https   funkymbtifiction tumblr com post              gravity falls mabel pines ESFJ elaboration  https   funkymbtifiction tumblr com post              mabel is ESFJ,enfp
Am I the only one who might speculate Mabel having Asperger Syndrome    Forgetting some social ques    Specifically wears one certain type of clothing  sweaters    Hiding in clothing for stimuli when stressed upset  sweater town    Struggling to see from another person s point of view  but still trying to be helpful    Clumsiness,enfp
OH BOY  another character that has all of the same personality stuff as me  WHY ARE THERE SO MANY LMAO,enfp
Just by looking at her face u would know she is an ENFP ,enfp
she s not sluai  she s way too selfish to be one  have you even seen how she acted during the mabeland episode ,enfp
HASJKASN I LOVE YALL TOOO     DDD,enfp
ENFP   ENTP   ENFJ   ESFJ,enfp
ENFP   ENFJ   ESFJ   ESFP,enfp
    I love you all too ,enfp
AWW TYSM,enfp
you guys have the same function stack as me and it automatically makes you cool,enfp
i feel loved,enfp
i genuinely wish i was an ESFP so i could be more aware of what s actually happening around me  i love high Se users  therefore i love ESFPs ,enfp
teehee,enfp
ENFJs my beloved,enfp
Who else thinks she ll start dating Elon Musk ,enfp
She s so hot  despair queen    ,enfp
She s evil so ENTP          ,enfp
Can someone explain EIE for her socionics  I haven t looked into Danganronpa in a while  D,enfp
why sanguine choleric     ,enfp
ENTP would imply that she has little care for her own values  or Fi  and prefers to hone her Ti through arguing  ENFP would fit better since she likes to hone her Fi the same way  That s why she feels the need to prove that despair is better than hope in these innovative  seemingly random ways  Ne   Despair is a feeling  and not necessarily logical so Junko would be ENFP  ENTJ has Fi as well  but their Fe is too low to try to influence others this way ,enfp
I can t vote   if she s the same in the game and in the show  ESFP,enfp
oh no  i am also ENFP  does this make me a junko kinnie by default  probably or probably not ,enfp
EVFL   I m glad she s not voted as EVLF simply because she s an ENFP  but there s no way she has  V over  L    Anne is extremely curious and inquisitive  she loves to learn  to think  to imagine  to discover  to share her know with others  all of that is flexible logic  She s aware of her intelligence and is extremely proud of it  she brags about it and want to encourage others to be like her   How could she possibly have  V  Anne is spontaneous  disorganized  undisciplined  has no actual sense of her goals and obligations  she just  wants  but never knows how to correctly get what she requires  Sure  she had that little competition with Gilbert  but it s not like only Vxxx and xVxx types can compete   She s probably the most obvious and stereotypical  L I ve ever seen  If she s not ELFV  she s ELVF ,enfp
Your Fi is so strong  A lovely character ,enfp
unpopular opinion   i only liked her in s ,enfp
idk how some people see anne as a INFP  she s so obviously an extrovert  like yeah sure she does spend a lot of time alone  but that doesn t necessarily make her an introvert  throughout the whole show she seems very very energized by people and seems to enjoy being around people without social exhaustion  she is a true ENFP and no one can change my mind ,enfp
she s definitely an extrovert  just because she struggled to fit in because of her past traumas  doesn t mean she s introverted  just look at her at aunt Josephine s party  she s so eager to meet new people  and she greets them without the awkwardness that can come with being an introvert ,enfp
Her Ne is so strong  she reminds me of myself so much  i don t know how you can type her as INFP,enfp
She is me except Exxx and w  lol     Always creeped out by the similarity while reading the books  watching the show the same feels   ,enfp
The epitome of ENFP  an obvious example of a Ne dom  Very expressive about her abstract ideas  observant in this aspect on the environment and its concepts  When she gets to lead  Ne is evidently there to explore existent concepts and unite them  As a dom extrav judg user she is curious and with a sense of exploration of the world     expresses in her very strong sense of expression of her individuality  introspection and free spirit    through her sense of curiosity and adventure for experiences and   through her strong state to not be controlled and judged   She can t help but having a conflicting desire to fit and feels conscern for fitting as a so   will do and sx   is clearly even in how she expresses even in her temperament,enfp
 Anne says she s too sensitive for this world   literally the definition of social  ,enfp
In the first MLP episode  Pinkie Pie demonstrated the element of laughter by remembering what her grandma once told her about facing her fears  She then used that knowledge she had learned from the past to help herself and all of her friends  Wouldn t that be more of an ESFP thing than an ENFP thing ,enfp
amizade ENFP sempre     ,enfp
what else can i add honestly xD,enfp
I would like to say that pinkie pies reaction to thinking her friends didn t like her anymore isn t necessarily an indication of   core  I think anyone would be upset about thinking the best friends you value more than anything randomly abandoned you  I agree   is her heart and second fix but I think the  ish things she does are geared more towards the motivation of a   rather than the other way around  I mean  isn t her motto  Fun  Fun  Fun    ,enfp
Why Pinkie pie is a so      Differentiating between so  and E  starts with clearing up the misconceptions about  s  Many people seem to believe that  s are completely selfless  compliant  and people serving for the sake of wanting to help  myself included  but this isn t entirely the case   A lot of   and so  traits overlap  They are both people pleasing  outgoing  and others oriented  However  their motivations for these behaviors are completely different    Twos are image based  They are prideful and seek to validate their self image of being helpful  caring  and unselfish  They like to make themselves look as  good  as possible  talking about their positive intentions and viewing those around them and needing help  and being dependent rather than themselves  needing validation    some excerpts on  s from     Twos are assertive  They are not meek and don t sit around passively waiting for people to show up with approval in hand  In fact  they have a strong will when it comes to getting what they want  Often  they look for situations and people they can cheer on     The passion of type Two is pride  Twos use pride to cover the hole in their self worth  Pride is essentially an over exaggerated sense of self worth based on what the Two provides to others      Twos are manipulative  One way that Twos try to bloat up their sense of worth is by  collecting  needy people that they can rescue    There are many more  but in short    focused on asserting themselves onto people they deem as needing their help to elicit admiration and approval  While their actions can definitely be out of love  a lot of the time there is an ulterior motive    Pinkie lacks the  s pride and assertiveness  her motives  which I ll get into later  aren t based on the need for appreciation or approval  but rather the  s hedonistic  thrill seeking nature    social  s resemble  s due to their similar self sacrificing  people oriented nature  but first  let s focus on why Pinkie s a core      Sevens are thrill seekers  Closely associated to hedonism is thrill seeking or risk taking  Sevens typically don t do or say anything that would detract from thrills     Sevens are gluttonous  Gluttony expresses their freedom of choice  They like to have a large variety to pick from and would rather try all the choices than just get confined to one     Sevens are hedonistic  Rebellion manifests through the striving of immediate gratification of one s impulses     s are always in pursuit of pleasure  they throw themselves in excitement and stimulation in order to deflect negative feelings from themselves or others  Pinkie pie is constantly throwing parties and seeking worthwhile experiences  she has a strong focus on what s  fun and exciting    She shows traits of  s because it is second in her tritype  which is pretty common for so s  making them appear   like  this counter type   description from integrative   explains how they are very similar to  s    This countertype acts against the gluttony that characterises the Seven  tending to mistype with Enneagram    They are generous and have a strong desire to be of service  to create a better world  They will sacrifice their own needs to serve the needs of a group or person they support  They can be judgemental regarding selfishness in themselves or others and they hope to be appreciated for their sacrifice     cont  ,enfp
her entire identity is built on helping others feel happy  when that is taken away she becomes confused and uncertain   sure  we see some of her   FOMO nature but even so  she shows more   which becomes more obvious in episodes like  party of one  and  pinkie pride   I understand why people see    but I disagree  just because most ENFPs tend to   doesn t mean they all are,enfp
i love her since i was little  one of my biggest kins,enfp
A lot of the arguments for   over   seem to be based on her enthusiastic personality and times where she lacks sensitively to others is a clear giveaway for    However  this relies on the view of  s as sober and responsible caretakers who always know the mature thing to do  This is not the picture that Naranjo points of  s    s in fact have a lot of the traits of impulsivity  creative imagination  and seeking pleasure and excitement stereotypically associated with type    He writes about   s hedonism    The compulsive pursuit of pleasure of the ennea type II person naturally supports the gay persona of histrionic people  with its pretended contentedness and animation  It is reflected  also  through a propensity to be frustrated and when not specially pleased  through attention  novelty  stimulation   through a low tolerance to routine  discipline  and other obstacles to an irresponsible  playful life    A   would be as dissatisfied growing up on a rock farm as a     Now look at how Naranjo distinguishes   and      The main contrast between the two characters is that  while the glutton is amiable and diplomatic  the proud can be either sweet or aggressive  so that  as I have sometimes remarked  their motto might be  make love and war    Their narcissism also differs  We may say that the former is sustained through an intellectual apparatus  the activity of charlatanism in the broad sense of the word  In ennea type II it is supported by a more naive falling in love with oneself  an emotional process of self loving through identification with the glorified self image and repression of the deprecated image  Also  the narcissism of the glutton is more inner directed  in that he becomes an arbiter of his own values  as Samuel Butler has stated in describing one of his characters as  a messenger from his church to himself     Ennea type II is more outer  directed  so that there is more admixture of borrowed values in the glorified self image    Pinkie Pie s disposition much more resembles the wild emotional highs and lows of a   than the more calm and intellectual    Her orientation towards the world is also entirely outer directed  other oriented  and viewing the world through emotions    Am I happy  and is everyone else happy  I have to make everyone happy   She doesn t have some greater intellectual idea of how the world should be  she just cares whether others are showing the emotion of happiness   I also want to address the argument that  if Pinkie Pie were a    she would be more sensitive to others  needs and handle them maturely  Remember that   s passion is pride   while they are likely to understand how others think more than others  and Pinkie Pie does  she has an uncanny knowledge of what other ponies want and what would make them happy   they are not objective observers who always know how to be nice because they are driven by their own desire to inflate their egos with how giving they are and to get love from others no matter how pushy they have to be about it  This can and does lead to  s hurting others  feelings as they pursue those things    So Pinkie Pie s character traits that point to   point just as much to    Combined with how Pinkie Pie is shown time and time again to be motivated to the core by wanting love and appreciation through fulfilling others  needs  it seems clear that she is in fact a   ,enfp
instead of focusing on ne dom vs se dom we should probably focus on ni inf vs si inf if we re struggling on what to type her as since theres not a lot of differences in the functions   im pretty solid already on pinkie being an ENFP but i just wanna bring this to her page  ,enfp
while pinkie pie genuinely and deeply cares for her  many   friends  she has trouble at perceiving the real needs others have in the moment  at times  she s too loud for her more quiet friends  when overjoyed she invades personal space  we see this a lot   in  too many pinkies   basically the FOMO episode  she presents an extremely common thing in unhealthy average level Sevens  multitasking out of fear of compromising with a single thing  saying  yes  to something means saying  no  to everything else    leading to not giving each of her friends the attention the shared company really deserves   if she was  w   i feel consideration of her friend s feelings would come way more naturally to her  it s not that she doesn t care or love her friends  she does  and so much  her entire thing revolves basically around making people happy  it s that she s so caught up in her search for joy happiness entertainment enjoyment fun  she does not have that  radar  twos have that allows them to immediately see what people need   Seven s sin vice is gluttony  to stuff the self with instant experiences out of the belief that happiness is something external you have to obtain  instead of a state you can enter when you are  sober   pinkie pie is happiest when she fully concentrates on her job as a party planner  she thrives in this productive  focused state  to plan a party from start to finish  no getting distracted  no multitasking  to finish a task  for real  it s this state of mental quietude that moves the   to     pinkie pie s anger manipulation that resembles the  you don t care about all i do for you  attitude of unhealthy Twos can really make a good argument for  w  pinkie  but to me  her utter sadness and hopelessness when she s a little kid on a boring rock farm  or when her cutiemark s switched to applejack s speaks so much more    Core lie for    The world wants to shackle me  and if I don t keep moving  I will be trapped in a life of pain  Disintegration to    The world has succeeded and I am in pain  I must resign myself to this misery and become yet another cog in a soul crushing machine    that s pinkie pie s flavour of unhealthiness  to be deprived of fun and stimulation and forced into the boring dullness of soulless tasks with no room for spontaneity   joy   also  what are you all s thoughts on her tritype  i obviously see her as core   and then   fix  but what about the third part       i dont see her as   at all  even with her extreme positive optimistic thing going on  she really doesn t have much trouble with confrontation or even competition  i ve never seen her as someone with a  let s keep the energies calm and harmonious  person if that makes sense  but that could be just me stereotyping ,enfp
After seeing a few other comments I feel that Jinx fits a sexual   more than a sexual    First of all  she always acts based on her emotions and she desperately craves validation  love and attention  This definitely seems more like a heart type than a head type  A fear of abandonment isn t exclusively a trait of E   everyone can feel that way if they grew up in an environment like that and especially if they have severe symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder  Jinx also has   and   in her tritype which is why she wants to appear strong but at the same time  she wants to appear strong to gain validation from others  She stole the hextech gemstone so she could prove to Silco that she isn t weak and as a kid  she wanted to make her bombs work so she could help and prove herself to her friends and her sister  who she admired  Also  while Jinx has the desire to be strong and face danger head on  she shows her vulnerable side to the people she cares about  something that a sexual   wouldn t do  Core fears and desires are unconscious  yet Jinx is very much aware of her need for support and she constantly doubts herself and her abilities which seems like something that would be more unconscious for a sexual    Finally  Jinx s anger seems incredibly explosive and impulsive  she is extremely emotional  while sexual  s  being a head type  are more cold and logical and only react that way when they feel like their position of strength is being threatened ,enfp
here s my argument for sx    jinx was conditioned throughout her childhood that one must be strong and competent to be useful and to receive love  this was taught to her not only by the people around her but from her environment  she has a strong need to prove herself as worthy of love and as worthy of her position and this manifests into over compensating like we saw when she went against silco s wishes and went out on a mission on her own  while other types may be more well known to be dependent on a person for guidance and meaning  sx  s can be the same  it just comes out differently  they do everything in their power to not seem weak or vulnerable so that they can be respected and seen as valuable  that may seem like   in some situations but it just manifests in a different way  i do agree that she has a lot of type   traits but i think she just has more   tbh  here s some of the explanation of sx       The countertype of the Type Six subtypes  the Sexual Six is the most counterphobic Six  the one who turns against the passion of fear by assuming a stance of strength and intimidation  Instead of actively feeling fearful  these Sixes have an inner belief that when you are afraid  the best defense is a good offense  As Naranjo explains  anxiety in this Six is allayed by skill and readiness in the face of a possible attack  They often appear bold and even fierce  They go against danger assertively  and even aggressively  as a way of denying and coping with their  often unconscious  fear    while others have said that jinx is too dependent to be a sx    i disagree  i think sx  s can be dependent aswell but it s often unconscious  a sx   doesn t have to be super mean and cold  it s just abt their need to seem strong and to be able to call themself a competent person in their surroundings ,enfp
What  s crave  more than uniqueness  is acceptance  They are not driven to be unique  they are drive to be significant  Being unique is just one way of doing that   Jinx is definitely not a head type  She is completely consumed by her emotions  her personal experience  and its not existentially curious in the slightest  I ll compare head vs heart triad values here   heart    I don t feel satisfied with how I am treated   I need to be valued to feel satisfied   why do I feel alienated from the tribe   what can I do to gain worth and or attention needed in the tribe   why do we exist   what are we living here to do   what is the deep rooted reason why our society is structured   what ideas can i think of to make this life worth living  She is very clearly heart triad  desperate to be loved  noticed  and accepted  going to extreme measures to do so   Anyway    isn t like her at all    doesn t just crave security in close relationships  they want physical  financial  social safety  Jinx is only paranoid about losing her loved ones  not about shelter  money  medication  wider society  anything like that  She s very physically self destructive and risky  getting into deadly fights and dealing recklessly with bombs  She is not compliant with society nor does she feel the compulsion to work like a    worker bee mentality   She doesn t need routine  consistency  stability  or long term plans to feel safe   As for why she s enneagram    Let s first get it straight that enneagram  s do not create and identity in an obvious way  Most of their attempts to gain a significant identity are unconscious  since they conflate their image with their true self  However we do see Jinx s image in the way she completely changed herself once separated from Vi  She wants to have a very powerful  significant identity  which she achieves by trademarking her murders with spraypaint  and even changing her name  This is all because she feels her true self is shamefully deficient  She is a classic example of overeasoning  justifying her actions by blaming her circumstance  and other people  She pulled the classic   line  you made me this way   She is desperate for validation and I don t think it s for safety  does she want Silco and Vi to protect her  Nah  most of all she wants them to love her    Insecurity becomes our fate  and we try to find self esteem and worth in the acceptance and conscience of other people  We seek external validations because we do not trust ourselves  we attach and cling to people we may love because we depend of their opinions  We understand opinion as absolute truth in the   space    So much like Jinx  she tries so hard to impress Silco  Even as a kid she tried hard to impress Vi  E   Within comparisons  there is envy  because people have happiness and things we do not have  therefore we envy them  we want what they have and we want to have what they also want  to prove ourselves and to prove for people that we are real  meaningful  special  that we have a presence and some place within humanity  This envy is so obvious when it comes to Cait  She can t stand her because she is jealous   You might think from her wanting love  that she s a    But she isn t  she is far too solitary and focussed only on personal issues rather than worldly ones  as well as not denying negative emotions ,enfp
Too emotionally driven to just be Fi aux  Even if she is an ENFP  her Ne is largely influenced by what she feels rather than the other way around  Fi Ne over Ne Fi   Besides  Jinx being in a Te grip makes much more sense than her being in a Si grip  Her Si  aka her past or what she grew up with  casts a huge shadow over her rather than it being what defines her and her actions  unhealthy Si ter rather than Si inf in a grip   I might be wrong though  since there is a lot more to her character that could be explored in the upcoming season s ,enfp
Any argument for Te Si or Ne Fi  I see a lot of people saying  obvious ENFP    why these INFP votes    don t say FiSi loop   I don t vote based in a loop  because I see her Ne too    don t confuse mental illness   I agree   I know some people have good arguments  can someone bring some of them   Edit  I don t personally use   functions model  so if u argument with that  it would be pointless for both  srry   ,enfp
Here goes our evil ESFP representation to the trash  People are voting her as ENFP because she s inventive and looks like harleyquinn  So I m pasting one of my arguments here so more people can see it  there s some more of my arguments in this comment section  https   www personality database com comment          Creativity and originality is linked to Ne because of stereotypes  but if you read about each function you will see how any type can be or not be creative and original  the important part here is how she prefers to express it  and it s clearly in the physical world  she never expresses her creativity through brainstorming  cause she hates to think much about anything  it s painful for her  she prefers to act  and being her action realistic or not in your opinion  she still prefers to act  she s in a Se Te loop   The ESFP becomes very focused on planning and getting things done  without much care of how this might affect those around them  that s when she made the trap and killed a lot of defensors to steal the hextech gem   They can become focused on information and seeing the details of a situation and struggle to see the other layers of what is going on  her wondering if VI is real  if VI is working for the defensors  etc when they finally met again after years   They seem a bit aggressive and determined to get things done no matter what  which is not the norm for the ESFP  While they can certainly be capable of chasing their goals  the ESFP is not normally aggressive in their path to accomplish them  Their loop causes them to lose sight of their sense of moral code  wanting to only focus on facts and details instead   That s her entire character since the middle of episode   to now source ,enfp
PLEASE READ  Sx   Cold  calm composure  relies on logic  hides emotions  arrogant  vain sees themselves as a level headed authority  wants to lead rather than server others  wants a secure position of power  arrogance  confidence in themselves and their plans and abilities  SUPRESSED and UNCONSCIOUS fear  not overt fear and insecurity  avoids relationships  solitary   Sx   desperate for validation  tries to impress  competitive and extremely jealous  emotional expresses pain through rage  hatefulness  justifies bad behaviour due to their pain  blames others for their actions  possessiveness and strange limbic attachments  feigns superiority and interiorises others  but is very consciously insecure and self loathing  attacks and insults others to feel better about themselves  intrusive  violent,enfp
While arguments for jinnx as an INFP or ENFP both have really good points  Jinx as an Se dom is ridiculous  First of all just compare Jinx to Vi who is a very obvious Se dom  Vi deals with her problems head on and always finds practical and efficient solutions to her problems  unlike her sister  A good example of Jinx s lack of Se is her very first introduction in episode   when the two firelights go into the cargo  In a situation like that an Se dom would simply shoot the firelights with the pistol since it is the most practical and realistic way to deal with them  Jinx on the other hand places a tripwire that locks the door  paints a monkey head on the door  writes boom on a swing and swings it for the firelights to see  and uses something to zip past the firelights and place bombs on them  This entire scene shows how creative  innovative and impractical Jinx is and is a very clear sign of her strong Ne  Also in the first episode is another example of her lack of Se  When the thug chases Powder with the bag  she panics and leaves the safety of her companions  Later on Powder is so terrified of physical confrontation that she prefers to throw the bag in the water to escape  In a situation like that an Se dom wouldn t have lost their cool like that and would have stayed close to Vi and the others for protection  And even if they didn t  an Se dom would find a way to fight back  or attack against the opponent  like by throwing the bag in their face or just trying to punch them  Again I can t see how Jinx could be an Se dom when she shows no signs of Se and constantly uses her Ne to an absurd level ,enfp
First thing first  She is mentally unstable  probably even schizophrenic  therefore nothing is truly easy or obvious about her typing    Now  as far as the latest observations show   Trauma has this effect on your cognitive function  If you lead with extroverted function  your next strongest function will become your other extroverted function  Introverts contrariwise   Therefore  ENFJ   Fe dom will develop stronger and healthier use of Se than Ni  INFJ Ni   Ti   Jinx is on what appears to be pure extroverted  Te  rampage  missing any healthy use of introverted functions  Could it just be that her Fi is overshadowed by her mental state  Could be  but we have only so much data to work with  so I will put this possibility on the back burner using occam s razor   She isn t decider  therefore the question is   Se or Ne  And here I am at my wits end and go only by  vibe    As Powder  we can see contrast between her and strong Se user like Vi  And I also can t help myself to not see her as ENFP  answer  to ENTP Joker    So yeah   most likely ENFP  possibly ESFP  less like likely IXFP ,enfp
does anyone have specific examples frm the show of fi ti,enfp
This guy is the most ne dom in the world if there was a representation for ENFP it would      be him and he has a lot of fi te fi is pretty obvious when he makes decisions and te is how he understands the force and deferent cases when he wants to get information in general ,enfp
A fantastic representation of an ENFP  w    Jake is a special boii,enfp
his functions are clear as day  i think with other ENFPs in sitcoms is kinda difficult to place their Fi or Te  Michael Scott or Phil Dunphy for instance  but with Jake is so clear to me  His Fi is super strong since the start  and we see him develop his Te and Si through his relationships with Holt and Amy  as they develop their Ne with his help too ,enfp
 These Sevens tend to look at things with the optimism of somebody who is in love  Everything looks better when you are in love  and the Sexual Seven takes refuge in this kind of ideal  positive experience as a way of unconsciously avoiding what might be unpleasant in life  They focus on a highly positive view of life to distract themselves from the uncomfortable or scary emotions they would rather remain unaware of    https   www ashliewoods com enneagram sexual seven,enfp
he s the most ENFP ENFP to ever ENFP,enfp
Hey can anyone walk me through how he is Ne Dom and not Se Dom  Because I can totally see him as an ENFP with his attitudes and how he fits in the stereotypes  but I can t help to wonder how if he was voted as an ESFP I could see him as a Se Dom as well  Lately I have just been having trouble differing Se and Ne  specially in group dinamics because both functions usually like to make other people laugh and to be in the  center  of social groups  If anyone could please help me  ,enfp
I agree he is def an ENFP but why  w   ,enfp
S E  is basically Jake having a Si grip for    minutes,enfp
It s interesting how an ENFP can be naturally in sync with ISTJs in certain US comedies  His dynamics with Amy and Holt are adorable  It really shows what ISTJs and ENFPs have in common  practically achieving functional goals in defense of an inner ideal  This is especially with Jake   Holt  the ENFP subordinate   ISTJ boss  a cursed combination at first glance  their life philosophies might seem polar opposite at face value  but they share an individualistic  principled touch in their psyche  and appreciation for the multifaceted nature of life    Michael Pierce describes INFP  ENFP  ISTJ  and ESTJ as the  Free Spirits   Those types have the sense of individuality  but instead of an intensity and singular perception  they have the philosophers  exploratory perception  giving them more of a sense of travel  making them even less fettered than the  Royalty  types  They want to be free and go their own way in one way or another   I sometimes suspect it s because US is a Se dominant culture  Ne and Si seem to be friendlier to each other  I live in a Si dominant culture and this healthy dynamic between Ne and Si user is really a rare sight in media representation ,enfp
Because he is not mean there is no reason for he to be an ENFP,enfp
Too social  ESFPs are known for being social  so ESFP ,enfp
the ENTP votes confuse me  if he were an ENTP he wouldn t want holt s approval ,enfp
we can all agree on chaotic good right,enfp
He is very clearly an ENFP  So glad they actually made an ExFP in tv without constantly and intentionally making him look sound stupid and cLuMsY all the time  Jake Peralta is a gift to humanity tbh,enfp
Se Dom written by an Ne Dom  his awareness of his surroundings is incredible  watch the first episode and the one where he guesses everyone s secret Santa  not sure ENFPs can do that   Andy Samberg can be an ENFP and definitely is husband goals   though ,enfp
I ve never seen this show  but the fact that the second most popular vote is ENTP makes me think he s really ENFP,enfp
First episode in and I realized that Andy Samberg is essentially playing an exaggerated version of himself  xD,enfp
Ne dom and Fi aux for sure  Look at all the ideas and personas he s created ,enfp
He is definitely ne dominant  he babbles about ideas all day long  I can also see auxiliary fi with his strong morals ,enfp
Hes a gift to every ENFP in the universe,enfp
I wanna vote for his Enneagram to be  w  but that would ruin the    votes,enfp
Find it hella funny when Captain Holt complained about him being late and his messy desk lol Jake s driven by his feelings  in an episode when he was afraid that Terry might panic after just getting back in the field and accidentally blew their cover  which shows that he tends to trust his gut rather than thinking through   So confused when people type him as ENTP      Ps  so happy that Jake and Amy have a baby  Huge congrats     ,enfp
I honestly see him as more of a Se user  Look at how he solves cases  he is incredibly observant   w  can look like Ne especially when ESFP  so I can understand the ENFP votes  What I don t understand is the ENTP votes  where is his Ti Fe ,enfp
ESFP  come on guys  jake is literally the personification of dom Ne ,enfp
I like how Jake and Amy are the complete opposites of each other when it comes to MBTI personality types  just like Jim and Pam from The Office  Michael Schur is common between both the shows   Jake is ENFP while Amy is ISTJ  Jim is ENTP while Pam is ISFJ ,enfp
I m seeing him more like ENTP  I relate him but not THAT much Ne Ti  I don t see Fi   ,enfp
ENTP  Just because a person is nice it dont means that they can t be a thinker  He have a really good Fe tert  not Fi aux  His humor can be explained by his enneagram   w  ,enfp
Nothing says  socially awkward with no regrets  than Ne  while Te seeks tribe or external validation  as a tertiary function it is shown in a childish way  as caring for others approval  like Captain Holt ,enfp
ESFP played by an ENFP ,enfp
uhh  ENFP  w  so sx  maybe soap with really weak sp to be honest  he s just so  no idea on tritype  Ne uses its external environment to come up with possibilities  still a perceiving function  it can pick up on things  Inferior Si   Inferior Ni is the tiebreaker imo  he has the development of a twelve year old so neither are really Developed  but  grips      he s played by Andy Samberg though and everything he touches is Ne ,enfp
ENFP as a detective   Riight  Just watch that scene when he guesses everyone s secret Santa  Se through and through ,enfp
Enjoy my joke letter typing argument  and then an actual argument  E  Luz interacts with people N  She has an imagination F  She has feelings P  She takes so long to learn magic Alright  time for my argument  even though we all know she s an ENFP  this is just for fun  Ne Dom  Luz is an extremely random  creative  and imaginative individual  She considers a multitude of different possibilities and ideas in all of her decision making  Luz also has a common habit of saying rather strange things in her speech that seem completely random  clearly a product of her Ne   Amity  oh Cramity    I thought we were as cool as cucumbers  But we re as sour as pickles   Something extremely Ne Si and demon Se of Luz was the fact that she headed to the Demon Realm to avoid the reality of her life  just like Mabel with Mabeland   Fi Aux  Luz definitely has very strong Fi  She has strong feelings  opinions  and beliefs about everything  and she acts based upon them   You fiend  You can t rhyme friends with friends    It s one thing to say I can t be a witch    but it s another to pick on my friends   Luz is unapologetically herself  and she escaped to the Demon Realm because she wanted to be somewhere she belonged  She couldn t take her real world and what it was  She s always constantly listening to her heart in order to help her and those she cares about achieve their goals   Te Tert  Luz actively  efficiently  and effectively works towards her goals  Her Te oftentimes causes her to act impulsively  because there s always something she s trying to do  and she pursues it no matter what it might cost  I also see her Te tertiary inside of Wing It Like Witches  insisting that they all could win if they put in the effort  without thinking about the possible emotional consequences   So maybe this seems like something of an Ne Te loop  especially because Willow pulls her into reality by telling her they can t just solve all their problems with a montage   Whenever Luz feels like she has to help someone she cares about  or get something for herself  such as trying to befriend Amity   she always immediately takes action  and does her best to work towards it  Si Inf  Luz s inferior Si is most visible when her mom is trying to send her off to summer camp  She doesn t want to be  normal   Luz wants to be her goofy  lovable self  Inside of Knock  Knock  Knocking On Hooty s Door  she was terrified that Amity might not like her for who she was  and she went into an Si grip in which she panicked over all the details and insisted to herself that what she was doing for Amity had to be perfect   Everyone back home said I was cheesy  I can t let Amity think the same   All in all  she s a huge ENFP  I think I might have missed something here  but  anyway  here s my argument  Thank you for reading ,enfp
THE ENFP queen     love her,enfp
She s a NE user  because she s very imaginative  thinks in all the possibilities and she s good investigating things  She discovered a lot of gliphs just by herself ,enfp
While the only other closet one could be INFP or ESFP  ENFP is just so fitting  She s a copycat Mabel pines the best way possible ,enfp
OMG SHES THE EXACT SAME AS ME I NEED TO SEE THIS,enfp
the INTJ vote is killing me,enfp
I love her sm AAAAA  I think we can all confirm that she is definitely a ne dom,enfp
She has one of the strongest secondary variants that I ve ever seen  I almost typed her as a social    but no she s sx so like Marcy from Amphibia  ,enfp
People will see a slightly extroverted and optimistic character and immediately go for    which doesn t even make sense in most cases  Especially not with Luz  From episode one  Luz has been looking to be worthy of love by being accomplished  She ran away from the Human Realm for not being accepted  and the immense joy in her face when she s being complimented  She s such a good example of a well written  w  ,enfp
Could somebody explain SLUAI   SCUAI ,enfp
she embodies ENFP  the amount of ne she uses is astronomical  love her so much,enfp
lmaooo not number five name eye ,enfp
WHY DID SOMEONE CHANGE HER NAME TO THE OTHER LUZ PLZ I GOT A NOTIF AND THIUGHT I VOTED ON THE WRONG PROFILE FOR A SEC,enfp
Even if I watched the first few episodes a long time ago  she was an obvious ENFP from the start,enfp
 every idea is a good idea  ,enfp
why does she have my EXACT personality  this is scary,enfp
Naurr cause why does she have identical typology to my best friend except she s ENFP not ENTP and I have almost identical typology to the other girl maybe I should watch this show   Why do I feel like they got beef based on typology alone,enfp
wow  it baffles me that people can actually believe for even a second that luz could ever be a    it s true that  s  core motivation revolves around identity  but the unique image that they want to project is that of being  broken   here s what the enneagrammer website  probably the most accurate online enneagram resource out there  says about the   s core fears    being easily understood or easily liked  being ordinary  too happy  too satisfied    s need to maintain themselves in a constant state of melancholy  dissatisfaction  sadness  etc etc to feel like their identity is solid and that they re worthy  they re scared of being see as too happy or too functional because they think it would rob them of the attention they need  so they constantly and unconsciously shift the image they project to always be different from other and to always be more unlucky than others  too  in other words    s literally cannot be bubbly or happy go lucky  that goes against the core of the type itself  also  when have we ever seen luz being elitist   trying to prove that she s above others to protect herself from a deep rooted sense of inadequacy brokenness   because sometimes that s often overlooked about  s is their elitism and judgmental nature  even if it s part of their core coping mechanisms  on the other hand   s can also be weird and flamboyant and go against the flow  but  s do it because their core motivation is being  trapped   being their full authentic self and embracing their weirdness isn t something they do for identity and image like  s  instead  they do it to avoid feeling trapped in societal norms that don t reflect who they are  another thing that proves luz isn t a   is that she s happy to meet other weirdos who don t fit in instead of trying to individuate from them  that shows she s not identified with uniqueness and alienation like  s are  in conclusion  luz wants to be herself to avoid feeling trapped  and it s very very clear that she doesn t have the coping mechanisms of a       I really recommend the enneagrammer s website over any other website ever  and also the empathy architects   some of fauvre s students  website and instagram page for more info on  s because yes  the enneagram is about core motivations  but core motivations will always show up in some way in your behavior and  s  need  to have sadness and melancholy and aggressive individuation to be  s  ,enfp
I like that everyone agrees she s an ENFP  there s just  so much ne  so much  But where are you guys seeing seven   I don t see it  She is THE enneagram four  The entire damn show is about wanting to be yourself  fours core desire  and you guys just    hMm  seVen   definitely a four  probably wing three too ,enfp
isekaid into another world and stayed because she wanted to become a witch like azura  thus felt regret at the end  classic ENFP moment,enfp
Luz is a Ne user  Luz is such a creative and imaginative kid that her mother needs to send her to a  reality check camp  in the hopes of reacquainting her with reality  She wishes to learn how to be a witch and begs this person to educate her  her spell learning is intuitive  with her figuring out how to do things as she goes ,enfp

gosh  all my favourite characters are so different from me  i honestly wish i was just like them  but i have a very boring personality ooof,enfp
I remember in the second episode her  chosen one  journey had everything that could make her feel special but there was no real challenge  and even so  she felt  fulfilled   just an observation i wanted to make edit  she looks like my half sister  who unfortunately don t have the same personality  just mbti alike  ESFP ,enfp
WE HAVE ALMOST THE SAME EVERYTHING INCLUDING A RAGING MAIN CHARACTER COMPLEX,enfp
ela tem muita cara de ISFP  obvio que ela   ENFP mas se me mostrassem uma foto dela e me pedissem pra chutar um mbti  seria ISFP,enfp
What s with almost everyone using Ne ,enfp
It s funny how you can tell most characters  types in this show just by looking at their faces,enfp
Weird how in this episode  luz is still hanging onto her main character syndrome when she was talking to herself in the room saying  the main character always goes home at the end  I know it s her only material and back up knowledge when everything else fails to assure her  but she still reverted back to that  It could also be why she didn t get her palisman from the adoption  She still has that belief that while she s here  she s innit for the ride of the experience that she s going through rather than shaping any real big goals  Meaning that she ll probably whim and stumble her way into becoming a witch in her journey rather than seeing it as the final goal  To put it frank  the boiling isles is still a game to her and she goes about situations head on  not only because she has some experience in danger  but because she has some sense of feeling that she is unbeatable since a lot of arcs in the show was resolved through head on force  Hopefully we get an episode that wakes her up from this illusion of invincibility  and that the boiling isle is as dangerous as the real world  And if I seem a bit too excessive I remembered a digimon frontier episode that has the main goggle boy believe that the digital world was like a videogame  and was about to get his team in big danger because he didn t see any consequences for his actions  and his Lancer right hand man rival  pretty much smacked some sense into him  and reminded him that this world is still dangerous and anyone can lose their lives if they re not careful ,enfp
Luz was so funny in this episode LOL  More of that Ne dom sense of humor   ,enfp

my queen,enfp
Can someone please explain to me where exactly the social   comes in with Harley  Because    people have her marked down as a sx so    and while I do agree with sx  I can t really see much so in her  Isn t the social  s whole deal rejecting gluttony and trying to seem overly pure in order to   make up   for having selfish impulses  When has Harley ever tried to do that ,enfp
Loser than Sakura  but much more agradable  He certainly didn t score guols with Lu s Roberto and didn t get trophies on PSN  man    ,enfp
harley please give me one chance just one,enfp
I just watched The Suicide Squad and yeah  NeSi SeNi  The Harley from Suicide Squad was probably a Se dom but this Harley  Birds of Prey and TSS  is not   Her use of FiTe is seem  just look at her dialogue with Silvio when he s dying ,enfp
i think she only seems like an Ne user to some bc of mental illness     its not healthy Ne if its there but i agree with the comments that type her as a doer    ,enfp
Think her dominant Ne is very clear  Just because she is a skilled warrior and badass doesn t mean she can t be an intuitive or has to be a Se user  She is way more random than concrete and is extremely random about everything she does  Following her ideas without knowing where they will lead to  She is highly idealistic and sees the potential in others like the Joker  which makes her a bit naive at times  A Se user would be way more realistic and focused on the imideate environment ,enfp
  I always see Harley typed as an ENFP  I disagree with this  Compare her to her boyfriend  Joker  a Ne dom  He s about possibilities  huge future ideas with no real direction  really has no concern with the present moment or impacting the physical realm  Does Harley do this  No  She s the doer  handling the physical aspects of Joker s plans  Harley doesn t sit around and dream up abstractions  she DOES things  When she s not DOING something  she s bored out of her head     https   funkymbtifiction tumblr com post              batman the animated series harley quinn ESFP    text Harley   Quinn     BESFP  D  Funky   MBTI   in   Fiction    E          Batman  A   The   Animated Series  A   Harley   Quinn     BESFP  D,enfp
Can an ESFP voter explain to me where she uses Se Ni ,enfp
she absolutely embodies ENFP sexual  w  with all her optimism and idealization,enfp
where do you guys see       for her tritype ,enfp
Maybe it s bias  because Margot Robbie is ESE  but she still feels ESE in this portrayal  The key for me lies in the scene where Enchantress shows Harley what she wants  which is the same as the original ESE character  To live a normal family life with Joker  She s still that Fe Si caregiver  just really uh  messed up in the head  In Birds of Prey  she even gets one of her signature Hyenas  which always struck me as her surrogate  babies    her words not mine    Full disclosure  I haven t seen the new Suicide Squad yet    ,enfp
Do you guys think that she s ESE even in the new TSS ,enfp
Why IEE   can someone explain ,enfp
I m tired of people thinking  oh  they re observational and impuksive  so Se dom   I get the logic  but they don t seem to understand that Ne is a function that looks outside of itself  it kinda has to be somewhat in the moment  especially in Ne dominance  The common idea of Ne fits INxPs usage of it a lot more because in INxPs  they re naturally Bess impulsive due to Si being higher and leading with a judging function   Harley is incredibly detached from reality  she doesn t seem to care about her body or stability  nor does she care about making a big inpact on sensory reality or even intensity of sensation like Se doms are  Ne doms  despite payong attention to the outside world  don t often have the threshold for novel sensations that Se doms do despite their excitability and impulsiveness ,enfp
Okay  now I m confused about her sociotype   ESE SEE ,enfp
I get hat she is more probably an ENFP   i just want to say that people should stop with the   she is out of touch with reality so Ne   Her being out of touch with reality is the expression of her insanity mental issues   not her cognitive functions  ,enfp
Harley is always ENFP no matter what media she s in  I get the reasoning behind ESFP because of her fighting in this movie but she lives way too much inside her head to not be Ne ,enfp
Okay   So there have already been a lot of compelling arguments about the case for dominant Ne as opposed to Se  which I agree with  any individual is capable of becoming physically adept  I think it s just a matter of users with stronger Sensing functions having a greater cognitive aptitude and interest in such a thing  Now  I wonder  does Harley operate on a fluctuating Ne Te loop   like does this manifest as her constant and aggressive  doing   Could actually be more of an Enneagram   thing  but yeah  after she killed the then Corto Maltese president  I think her introverted functions crept in  Fi in the emotional disturbance pertaining to the  Red Flags  and the Si of just how purely haunting Joker s abuse of her was   And yeah  Enneagram   is pretty significantly present  obviously  the chemicals and psychological malpractice to get her to become like the Joker has influence in this  but her general happy go lucky attitude  that sounded cynical  I m sorry  I m just having a hard time with adjectives at the moment  and constant quest for novel thrills  I m going to lean into Wing   over    because I think her escapist desires tend to manifest more closely with detachment from the sensory world and her more imaginative impressions  People in the comment have already insightfully alluded to it  but yeah  the artistic depiction of her psychosis when she was busting out of her imprisonment and gunning the Corto Maltese soldiers I think indicates the more  head based  escapist desires versus more environmentally driven thrills as might be associated with Wing     It s really stupidly obvious at this point  but yeah  Margot Robbie is pretty synonymous with Harley Quinn at this rate  and I d argue the recent movie solidified it at the same level as Robert Downey Jr  with Iron Man or Hugh Jackman with Wolverine  It s possible the  antics  aspect of her personality were to be anticipated  but I think James Gunn fleshed them out in a more realistic  whilst still being whimsical  manner  Yeah  I think my favorite bit is with the repressed darkness of her psychological trauma as was shown in the scene with the then Corto Maltese president   Thank you ,enfp
i m sorry ESFP voters but     other than in the first Suicide Squad film  where do you guys see Se dom  and don t mention her being good at fighting and being very physical as proof of Se dom  you gotta remember she is a trained gymnast so she is bound to look like a sensing type in that sense  BOP snd TSS literslly made her a walking ENFP stereotype with her being almost completely out of touch with reality  being unable to recall meaningful details  being scattered  jumping from one thing to another really fast  not being able to notice the most obvious things  ect  all signs of inferior Si   she percieves a large variety of abstract concepts  ideas and possibilities and she looks to expand her never ending web of abstract connections  the smallest occurence makes her think of a million different things she wants to try out  some more practical snd realistic thsn others   in Suicide Squad she was depicted very differently  she had an incorrect sense of reality but a sense of reality nonetheless  was more action thsn possibility oriented and her weakness was more being unaware of future implications and possibilities more thsn anything else  but since then she has been depicted as almost the exact oppossite ,enfp
Another classic ENFP that can be confused with ESFP because  being too physical   Her motivations in taking the actions she does much better fits under the purview of Ne      Ne DOM  I love rain  it s like the angels are cu mming on us         Si INF  Si repressed by Ne   Was Milton with us  I don t know any Milton    I would know if there was someone with the name Milton around us      hour later   Of course we can be friends  Milton    Wait  why that face     We spent hours talking about your name being Milton   She spoke to the team leader  His name is NOT Milton at all  Milton DIED and she didn t notice cause Si inf HAHAHA ,enfp

Why  w   I think she s far from one  She resorts to violence when threatened ,enfp
It s understandable to initially recognize her as a Se dom  mainly regarding her ability to take quick actions using her immediate surroundings  but I would make the argument that her motivations in taking the actions she does much better fits under the purview of Ne    In the new movie The Suicide Squad  we see her general disconnection from what s actually going on around her at full effect  mainly as she is displayed to have her head up in the clouds throughout  rather than perceiving unfiltered reality like what would be expected of a Se user  Most notably  in a scene where I imagine James Gunn tried to pull us into her perspective of how she sees the chaos around her  we see her machine gun fight while escaping captivity turn into a colorful daydream like sequence of her madness mixed with reality  notably as flowers suddenly appeared behind her and bright splashes of color and animated birds filled the room  I personally believe that the animated birds in the scene are meant to symbolize flying away from reality  as well being a reference to her last movie Birds Of Prey   and that the flowers filling the room are supposed to represent the beauty she see s in violence  showing us how displaced she really is from the horrific acts of brutality that she commits against her opponents  If she was a Se user  she would likely be more in tune with her sensory surroundings on a factual basis  something she tends to drift away from generally in favor of her rose tinted Ne perspective of physical existence  Also  she tended to always look for new emerging possibilities on a general basis  most noticeable in her situational ingenuity when placed in tough situations  For example  in the scene where she s being tortured for information  she messes around with the people questioning her and pretends to fall unconscious from being tased  only to then wait for a single guard to let his guard down where she then attacks him and escapes capture  This quick thinking signals Ne usage also  as she stayed on the lookout for immediate random possibilities of escape that she could take in the situation  only to take action when she decided it was the best swift action to take  Also  I see her having Si inf to be highly probable  as she had a very undeveloped internal system of recalling past experiences and made very impractical choices based on them  For instance  when her captor   fianc  General Silvio Luna started to raise a red flag for her  she decided that the best course of action would be to shoot him  citing her past experiences with other boyfriends that it would be the best course of action to take to minimize any future possible altercations  I would attribute this to a lack of function development  due to how impractical and seemingly random her reaction was  even in the context of this film  Overall  as I do somewhat see the case for her having Se as a dominant function  especially in the original Suicide Squad  which I d rather forget about lol   her Ne is just to prominent for me to ignore  Hope this helps explain my rationale  ,enfp
Kind of hard to not see her as Se valuing in Socionics  considering the first tactics she usually resorts to are pressure manipulation  Can be casually cruel and exclusive in a decisively un ESE manner  which tends to be more diplomatic  Very daring and direct  If she is not SEE  she d be EIE  but I cannot see her Se     as anything but   D      ,enfp
Dude  she is legit interpreting life in her own way through her imagination  She is less in touch with reality than any Se dom ever could  This is actually the most Ne dom she has been in any of the movies ,enfp
I waited until The Suicide Squad        dropped so I could assess her over the course of   different narratives  TSS is her at her most ENFP  She s a very well developed Ne Fi user  the flowers death sequence and just how she speaks through Gunn s script really underscores and builds upon her characterization in BoP  I do think the writers and directors really influence the character quite a bit  Under Ayer s vision  she was a clear ESFP but both Yan and Gunn s interpretations reek of ENFP    She actually has a good moment where she overcomes the dreaded Si weakness when confronting President Luna ,enfp
traits of unhealthy Ne dom   disconnected from reality  harley is never really connected to the moment  even if she s a badass and good at fights  she s always with her mind in the clouds and rarely into the REAL world   unable to learn from their mistakes  abandoning tasks half finished  continual longing for  better  things  often unsatisfied  lack of focus  chases immediate stimulation  disorganized  careless  and impatient  unreliable  and instable  always seeking novelty  leave stable situations too easily  scatterbrained  irresponsible  she s a Ne dom  and also her struggling with her Si it s pretty clear if someone think that she s a Se dom  where is the Ni tho  because i can t see it,enfp

I want to have friends  but I m not that desperate to cling to teenage people in my surroundings that can t respect other human beings other than those who agree with them  also all they can do is curse or complain at teachers and their parents  I m not saying they can t like people  because they can  but could you be more constructive in your critique while expressing your opinion  Is it so hard to be a decent human    So I guess the closest I have to friend is my room OR parents  grandparents and every member of my family when I meet them once a year  and all they get is my complaining about why do I have to deal with people  without a brain     So I guess they wouldn t think of me as their friend  but rather that family member who always laments about how human society is corrupted and how I will never find a person I like   Oh  well I got emotional and frustrated     again ,enfp
Very reliable and down to earth  although sometimes she can be impulsive ,enfp
He s a loser and I love him  p The most ENTP  w  to ever ENTP  w ,enfp
Sometimes I think shes more ni  ENFJ  than si   ESFJ  but anyways  kind  affectionate and always helps others   although if this implies hurting herself  she will think about it more than twice   She likes to do and think what is  correct   that is  what complies with the norms of society  or of the government she is good at knowing how a person is feeling  or noticing that something is wrong with that person  without knowing how to explain why she believes it   Thats the reason why sometimes I tink shes a ni user   She is self demanding and posimistic  and at the same time outgoing and calm  ah  and she does not believe in mbti  because  it is not studied in a degree in psychology  ,enfp
I love her so much  she s my twinflame and I seriously cannot imagine my life without her anymore,enfp

This guy is such a paradox  someone who has intelectual narcissism  while still seemingly being so insecure about himself  He s so anxious and lacking proactivity  he always says  he goes by the flow  but we all know he doesn t    I ll say this is more about the internal contradictions that ILIs make   He doesn t want to show or knows how to externalize emotions  he mentions he has a lot of problems when it comes to his own emotions and how to manage them  He s just like that little kid  that won t let you talk because he s so excited that someone finally hears him ,enfp

Not know about others  but     my besties are ENFP  one ESxP  she s kinda unstereotypical   Idk about the one  but I think her enneagram is   or                  Also a friend my new school  maybe ESTJ  w    ,enfp
she is SO different from me  but she is still amazing   ,enfp
known each other since  st grade  i think     B ,enfp
Did you know that my best friend is better than yours   ,enfp
The typology for my best friend of fifteen years is above  My other closest friend is a literal opposite to me   ESTP ENTJ  w  sp sx     SLE SLUEI Sang Chol  It makes for an interesting dynamic  to say the least   ,enfp
i have no friends,enfp
they are the literal best,enfp
I am an INTJ and i have only one friend  and she is  SFP  I still haven t fully typed her  but i think she is ISFP   And we are like complete opposites,enfp
I have my two best friends    ENFP  w     INFP  w ,enfp
we get along so well and have a lot of similar interests,enfp
she s the only friend i ve ever had,enfp
Love them so much  such a nice person  we ve been buddies for    years now   ,enfp
Angriest man I know lol  we act a lot alike,enfp
Imagine having friends        ,enfp
my best friend is an INTJ and I m an ESFP  been friends for    years and counting  crazy how our mtbi s are complete opposites yet we get along so well,enfp
the icon it s true  cause i have a crush for her lol   ,enfp
Shoutout to my true bestie who stood the test of time   weren t best friends from the moment we shook hands ghjfhk ofc we r different but surprisingly it works,enfp
Sometimes he really infuriates me but I think we complement each other pretty well  I would like for him to be able to see on him what I see ,enfp
literally the best person i know,enfp
that was hard for me cause im part of   groups,enfp
My bestie always call me too sensitive  but he has the same MBTI as satan so I don t mind,enfp
As an INTJ  probably   idk why but i always find myself with Se doms  most of my friends are and i love them so much,enfp
We are such a good duo,enfp
my best friend,enfp
My best friend is an ENFJ  only took the test because I asked her  such a considerate person  always makes me feel good  being honest sometimes I don t feel worthy of her friendship  too much honesty  v,enfp
too mentally unstable to be typed,enfp
If you re looking for a companion whom you can sit down with at a quiet place away from the crowd and have hours of deep intellectual conversations about philosophies  the meaning of life  the universe etc   befriend an INFJ    Edit  Okay  nobody really cares BUT I m gushing with excitement right now because I just found out my best friend s a  w  and Melancholic Phlegmatic  Our friendship s almost ten years now  and I m beyond convinced that it s definitely meant to be  ENFP s highest compatibility is INFJ  and it s mentioned in the    blends article that it s very common for Melancholic Phlegmatic to be drawn to Sanguines due to their carefree nature  And her being  w  makes so much sense too  she s cautious which complements my carefree impulsive nature and she s really loyal  She tends to expect the worst case scenarios while I tend to be overly optimistic about things  Like WOW  everything makes so much sense now  That adrenaline rush you get when you finally type someone right  that s the best way to describe this excitement ,enfp
Yep,enfp
i will keep her safe at all costs    she really is way better and more understanding than all my other friends that are just guys,enfp
the most si dom ever,enfp
I changed his type from ENFP to ENTP after thinking more deeper ,enfp
How the hell it happened  I dunno,enfp
    irl close friends types    jaselin   ENTP  w  sp so   angie   ISFP  w  sx sp   stella   ESFx  w  so sx   johanna   ESxJ  w  so sp   claire   ISFP  w  sx sp   nell   ENFP  w  so sx   parker   xNFP  w  sx so   spree   ESTP  w  so sx   eris   xSFP  w  sx so   leo   ISFP  w  sx sp   abby   INxP  w  sp sx     online close friends types    placie   xNFP  w  so sx   kitson   INTP  w  sp sx   seal   ENxP  w  sx so   apel   INFP  w  sp sx   bini   ISFP  w  so sx,enfp
My current best friend is an ENFP  w   We can talk all day long  always having the most absurd conversations  Just bouncing from an idea to the other  He is way more extrovert than me  Very outgoing  and adventerous  so we get along very well  Once we were driving back home from a bar and I asked him what would happen if we would just drive to the farthest city in our country    hours of road trip later we got there having fun at the beach for like half an hour to realize he had to go back for his mother s birthday   Never would have happen with any other friend of mine ,enfp
INFP  w  so sp IEI ISTJ  w  so sp ESI,enfp
ig opposites do attract      shes a sweetheart tho n ion think i deserve her for that  ,enfp
Most of my best friends are INTP,enfp
I just realized that his typing is the same as the Cat profile ,enfp
My current best friend has same MBTI as me  but with different enneagram  He s easily anxious of anything and he often asks me to seek certainty  Glad that finally I have friend with same type ,enfp
An amazing person  Lots of memories together and has been by my side for so many years ,enfp
I have three friends of   years  two of them share the same type and enneagram which is INFP  w  and the other one is ENFJ  w  the ENFJ one and me are the most chaotic and talkative in the group  the others just react to stuff we say  which is literally self explanatory but we definitely compliment each others personalities   They are also the reason why I m excited to school,enfp
i dont have any friend and best friend   ,enfp
my bestfriend is ENFP and when she s in Ne Te loop she s very scary lmao ,enfp
I have no friends irl  BUT IF I DID WE WOULD WEAR MATCHING CHICKEN SKIN OUTFITS FOR HALLOWEEN AND SING ADELE SONGS TOGETHER WE WOULD BE SO IN SYNC AND HAVE SM FUN I WISH I HAD FRIENDS SO BAD but they need to like chicken thats a REQUIREMENT,enfp
I really love her   ,enfp
i have no idea which friend we re talking about but most of them are INFPs,enfp
the only person i genuinely stand and love more than anything   ,enfp
i still doubt if me and my best friend were actually not a best friend  because he never admit he s my best friend  but i still love him  we ve been friend for   years   ,enfp
she took the test and got INTP  but only because I asked  she doesn t understand anything about mbti and functions and has to put up with me talking a lot about it   we trust each other a lot  which is great if you look at the environment we live in  we re very similar and terribly different   she knows how to appear calm  even if she isn t   but can be very logical  talkative  and needy   she constantly runs away from her problems and bad feelings as a way to deal with them  I know it s going to go wrong at some point  so I think it s going to be a little late   I m so grateful to have her in my life  i love her like a sister ,enfp
she s very weird and so interesting lol jk  i always saw something deep in her and i think i was right  she became the unique person i really felt comfortable to opened up in a time i was so lost about everything  she has a hard time with express emotions or simply understand them so put too much effort on help me  im just really grateful for this ,enfp
I wish i had one  ,enfp
She s drains my battery,enfp
I don t know if this is all correct  I think this is what he is ,enfp
He couldn t be more Fe inf even if he tried,enfp
the only person i would take a bullet for,enfp
and for my other friends i love type   s if you can t tell lol L  INFP  w  sx sp sluai mel sanguine     R  ISFP  w  sx sp rcuai phlegmatic choleric     E  ESFP  w  so sx rcuan phlegmatic sanguine      R  ISFJ  w      sx sp rcoan phlegmatic melancholic      J cousin   ISTP  w  scoai sp so phlegmatic choleric    ,enfp
My INFJ friend is a good listener  curious  accepting  has a sharp and witty sense of humor  he s open minded and has a deep sense of introspection on the world  We can literally talk about any topic for hours on end from philosophy to economics and life in general  He s also really growth oriented in his approach to life and I m glad to be there for him no matter what   I m so grateful to have him in my life ,enfp
she s the best my others are  ENFJ  w      sp sx SLOEN ESFP  w      so sp SLUAN ESFP  w      sx so SCUAI,enfp
my friend group   INTJ  w      sp sx she is very lazy  she is funny and laughs at anything  ESFP  w      so sp she is one of the smartest people i know and she is also very popular  ISFP  w      sp so  she s really nice and has a huge facility to make friends  she s a little sensitive  INFP  w      sp so she is smart and very reserved  but when she is with friends she becomes very affectionate  ENFP  w      sp sx  he s nice and he s also the kind of person who will always be with you in every situation,enfp
Already typed my best friends before but I ll try typing my other friends as well   ENFJ    w          sx so   SLOAI   Sanguine Phlegmatic   A very nice and funny guy  although he can be really sensitive sometimes    INTP    w          sp so   RCUAI   Phlegmatic  Dominant    Withdrawn and kind of dorky but pleasant to have around  Popular among the girls for some reason    ISTP    w          sp so   RCUEI   Phlegmatic Choleric   Doesn t feel comfortable in showing affection but always reliable when it comes to logic    ESFJ    w          so sp   SLOAN   Choleric Sanguine   Friendly and approachable  Basically the class clown but is also a dutiful person   INFJ    w          so sp   RCOAI   Phlegmatic Melancholic   A literal angel  both in appearance and personality ,enfp
omg our best friend is a ne ne si si     ,enfp
we used to think we were super similar as kids and turns out we re literal opposites lol,enfp
Since I was a kid  I have many best friends but the more I grow the more I grow distant to them  And now I have two friends  ISFP that I share many similarities but more social and her sensor words kinda hurts me     My sister said she was like a precious jewel to me   And an ESTP  I know I m stupid  her Fe is well develop  She is a new friend of mine  I don t know why  when I m in a conversation with ESTPs     it kinda works  Eventhough I judge them when they re doing some rebellious immoral stuff   ,enfp
I have a secret crush on my bff before but I kept it a secret cuz they will know I m not straight,enfp
Ever since elementary school until high school  my friends are mostly INFPs    I like that they re so loyal and caring the same time,enfp
  ,enfp
He says he is ESFJ  but I think he is more si than fe,enfp
he s the best,enfp
She is so clingy and sometimes I don t text her often but I love her so much ,enfp
She wrote an introduction  letter  for one of her classes and it was one of the most textbook INFP descriptions I ve ever read   An intelligent  stubborn  young lady who stands for her beliefs and is in love with both fantasy worlds and places with mushrooms and frogs   Btw I m not even sure if she even remembers me telling her that she s an INFP  I didn t expect her to describe herself as such a stereotype lmao,enfp
I want to boast about mine   Friends since more than    years  and I can say now with certainty  that s for life  The most loyal of them all  We have endless conversations and debates on random  controversial or philosophical topics  They have unique points of view  We help each other in our goals  Communication has solved our problems  I m proud of us  Friendship is underrated  ,enfp
I have two close friends  I am an ENTP but also have ENFP traits  And my friends are INTP and INFP  Our topics are real Ne topics  I feel really lucky for having them in my life ,enfp
my friend group has an ENTP  an ISTJ  an ENFP and an INTJ  me lol ,enfp
Yeaa,enfp
My group of best friends has    Me  ESTP an ENTJ   My closest friend who i know since i was    Very focused on her job  ambitious yet not bossy at all  She uplifts me   spoils me and always tries to reasonate with me  We are both very competitive though and we often have fights  silly ones  an ENFP   Super funny very social  She always goes with the flow and she is very approchable  Super creative  a lot of ideas and an eye for art and creation  She never takes sides on arguments though which annoys me a little  an ENTP  Really funny as well and really clever  Like reallyyy clever  She is full of chaotic energy which i love but at the same times has her      together  We laugh a lot together and she always have something intresting to say  i love debating with her and she is always blunt which i appreciate a lot since i am as well  An INFJ  An amazing soul and an amazing person in general  The voice of reason  Always supportive and helpful and extremely loyal to our friendship even though i drive her nuts since we are the complete opposites  She is the only feeler in the group and sometimes us thinkers dissapoint her unintentionally  Very harsh on herself   Do you guys tend to form friendships with extroverts if you belong to extroverted type  and vice versa for introverts  or do you think it s irrelevant ,enfp
My best friend group consists of two INFPs and an ISFP  so you can imagine the chaotic Fi dom energy,enfp
o outro   INFJ pelo que ele diz  mas ele se tipou pelas letras ent acho improv vel,enfp
He made a test and got INFP T  but FiNe fits them a lot,enfp
i don t have a best friend so i ll figure out what would be my best friend regarding my actual friends   val  she her    INFP    w          sx sp   rloei  cat  she her    INFP    w          sp so   rluai  meg  she her    ENTP    w          sx so   sluei  rim  she her    INFP    w          sx sp   rluei  mar  he him    ENFJ fe se loop     w          so sx   sloan  fau he him    ISFJ    w          sp so   rloai  saad  he him    ISTJ    w          sp sx   rcoan  to  he him    ENTP    w          sx so   sluei  ja  she her    ESFJ    w          so sx   sluai  sim  he him    ESFP    w          sx so   sluei  mar he him    ISFP    w          sx sp   rluei  van  she her    INTJ    w          sp so   scoai  lau  she her    INTP    w          sx sp   sloai  hcp  he him    ESTP    w          sx so   sluei  mar  she her    ESFP    w          so sx   sloan  gui  he him    ISTP    w          sp so   rcuan  can  she her    ENFJ    w          so sp   sloai  adr  he him    ISTJ    w          sp so   sloen   results   my ideal friend would be    btw i hope i didn t forget anyone   ENTP  w      sx so slxai tadaaa,enfp
what i can see clearly from her are the   core and sx dom,enfp
we ve been friends for over    yrs,enfp
sounds crazy  a messed up and confused friendship  but it s true  I admit she often drives me out of my mind  but our friendship lives on,enfp
my absolute bro,enfp
so annoying but i love that about her,enfp
why does my best friend have the same mbti   ennea as my mom,enfp
Yeah he was cool,enfp
I don t have a best friend ,enfp
I just met her in middle school  she even thinks I m a quiet  indifferent person and she s afraid to invite me to get acquainted    Over time  she and I became close friends  perhaps also because the cognitive function of the same Fe and Ti halves made us feel bonded Even though  she seems very organized and emotional compared to me  I will still keep her as my best friend Compared to the two bad friends I had in the dark ages  where they have the MBTI types that I hate  i e  ISTJs and I m starting to dislike ESFPs a bit ,enfp
Well I don t exactly have a  best friend  because I have multiple  EXTROVERTED THINGS XP  but I want to mention this one because  how can I not mention her   Also she was the easiest to type   Fi dom with her deep interest into emotional bonds between her loved ones to which is must needed for her  She expresses her Fi though poems  Se aux because she s likes taking risk and lives in the present moment  She absorbs her creative ideas from physical surroundings and she s a hands on learner   Ni teritary because she gets inner feelings about certain events and learns things quite easily if she is very interested in the subject  however if the subject isn t interesting to her  it will bore her to death  but she is willing to help neither the less    Te Inferior where do I even begin with this  Oh yes  when she is willing to work hard on something or interested in a certain goal  she tries to get rid of it and has a good determination to do it  however her motivation to do goals gets tiring for her and she ends up not doing it  Dosent mean she would not remind others to do so though,enfp
absolute king who is not afraid to call out bs also knows many legally questionable things which makes him    x funnier,enfp
i keep making friends with ISFPs help me,enfp
Have literally never met anyone with Si this god awful before but it s okay because my Ne is bad too  My best friend in middle school was an ENTP as well but she was SCUEI and a triple assertive      to be exact   it s really interesting to see how different their enneagram makes their personalities but also how similar their thought processes are with mbti,enfp
I never thought I would be so similar to an ENTP  our humor is exactly the same  he gets me out of my comfort zone and helps me build my Ne,enfp
We are funny  smart  and conquering the environment ,enfp
Her job is to bully me lol,enfp
katya i love you,enfp
I never thought that I will be able to be friends with ESTJ s but then I learnt my bestie is ESTJ lol,enfp
My friends   ESFP    w   ISFP    w  ISFP    w   ISFP    w   ENFP  ENFP ENFP ENFP  INFP  ISFJ ESFP IXFP  For most of them  I didnt put their enneagrams because I don t know theirs  but I never knew how much Fi users I have as my friends,enfp
She took the   p test and it said INTJ but she s obviously an ISTP   also pbd isn t letting me vote for her tritype ,enfp
  AlvaSpirit  I suppose this is you  ,enfp
we complete each other  D,enfp
Ok  so for about an hour or so I ve been debating her tritype    and   are definitely her heart and gut fix  but the head fix I had trouble with  Despite being a pretty optimistic person  sometimes to my confusion and dismay   I don t think she s all outwardly  positive   people oriented or cheerful enough to be the so called triple positive tritype  She s also very independent  hardworking and intellectually inclined too  and not particularly security or safety oriented in the way a   or someone with a   fix would be  She can be slightly eccentric and very intuitive too  which leads me to think her head fix might be  w   As for the others  maybe  w  and  w  ,enfp
She got ESFJ on   p smh but she is a clear fi user,enfp
i wish i could vote but she s so hard to type probably because she s always in loops and grips and not using her functions in a healthy way lol  i love her to death tho,enfp
I hate her ,enfp
My best friend in middle school high school is an ISTP   My group of friends I hung around most was   ISTPs  ESTP  ISTJ  and an INTP ,enfp
we are so similar in some aspects but completely different in others    love her tho  in three years of friendship we only fight one time,enfp
my baby,enfp
He is the wisest  smartest and most sensible person I have ever met  And one of the most cultured  both in the intellectual and emotional sense of the word    My only true friend  But he is BIG GOLD ,enfp
he s the funniest mf i ever met and we really get each other very well i appreciate him a lot   still a bit unpractical given the fact that we can t even copy eachother s homework even though we re both smart we re just lazy af and the only reason we get anything done is bc our ESFJ friend reminds us to,enfp
she got typed as INFJ by   p LMAOO,enfp
I m an ENFP best friends with an INTP and she is my WORLD  She means everything to me and I would give up anything I ever had if it meant she would be happy  She is the light of my life and no one could ever replace her  she s the best person in the world and I mean that whole heartedly ,enfp
KATTYYYYYYY   kattysmulders ,enfp
I LOVE YOU SHARTYYYY,enfp
My   bff is ENFJ INTJ ISFJ and i think these type have high compatibility with INFJs,enfp
Idk how that even works tbh but I couldn t live without them,enfp
xsxp s always end up being my  lifers,enfp
Him and me have basically the exact same personality  except he s an introvert and I m an extrovert ,enfp
il   c   sempre ,enfp
Seems like ama best friend,enfp
An ENTP with incredibly high Fe  literally the best person I ve ever met  I ve known her for almost   years now  she s older than me by a couple but she s always been there for me like an elder sibling or even a mother almost  I grew up as an only child so having someone like her in my life really helped  She s helped me through so much and I appreciate her a lot for that ,enfp
RHIANNON IF YOU RE REAING THIS I LOVE YOU       My best friend in the whole entire world ,enfp
she s too kind ,enfp
i have a bunch of friend groups but they re pretty scattered and i m unsure of a lot of people s types  but some of my closest and most consistent friends are INFP  w   ENFP  w   ESTJ  w  and ESFJ  w ,enfp
I have a friend group  but I am most close to her  Anyway  let me introduce my other friends   ENFJ  w        Sanguine  dominant   SLUAI  ENTP  w        Sanguine  dominant   SCUAI  ESFP  w        Sanguine  dominant   SCOAI,enfp
We both share the same sense of humour lol  Also my other friends are   ESTP  w      Choleric Sanguine  twin sister    ISFP  w      Choleric Melancholic    ENFP  w      Sanguine Dominant    ESTJ  w      Choleric Melancholic  ,enfp

well my best friend is actually INTP but i have another close friend who used to be my best friend who is ENFP so i had to break the tie  EDIT  ARE YOU KIDDING ME SOMEONE TIED IT UP AGAIN,enfp
she s the absolute best   we re different but i ve never gotten along so well with someone as much as i have with her,enfp
My amigos      INFJ   w        so sp  RCOAI  Melancholic Phlegmatic    ISTJ or an unhealthy INFP  I can t tell  I m trying to figure it out    w        sx sp  RLUEN  Melancholic Phlegmatic    INFP   w                sx so  RCOAI  Phlegmatic Sanguine    INFJ   w                so sx  SCOAI  Sanguine Phlegmatic    ISFJ   w                so sx  RCUAN  Phlegmatic Sanguine  Me  ENTP   w        sx so  SLUEI  Sanguine Melancholic   other than the first two and myself  these are really just guesses   Honestly I m an introvert magnet help ,enfp

My best friend is my girlfriend,enfp
he s f cking Ryuk from death note lmao,enfp
We are similar but so different   She seems more extroverted than me  Everyone likes her but she hates everyone except me hi hi  ,enfp
We have been best friends for almost   years  D,enfp
For I while I thought high Fe would make sense for her since she s very giving  kind person and has slight trouble completely asserting herself  I also thought this for a while since we both took an mbti test for a class last semester and got INFJ  After some pondering Ni dom and didn t make much sense so I thought ISFJ  but her having an intuitive function last made no sense either  I juggled between INFP and ISFP for a while too  But a few months ago when I visited her  I taught her about the cognitive functions  had her take the keys cognition test and she received ENFP    It literally all started to click at that moment  We both pretty much operate on the same level morally and abstractly and always seem to come to all these random conclusions about things that make almost no sense to no one but us  She s also good with her tert Te in using objective logic and motivating herself to get done on work and organizing things  Not      sure on her enneagram type  but it could be  w   which makes her more introverted and altruistic  She s phlegmatic as      too lmao  Ok  I m gonna stop typing now,enfp
i love her  shes authentic  she thinks like me  like the things that i like  anyway  shes such a good friend    ,enfp
what if you don t have friends  ,enfp

shes great idk if shes a   or a   tho,enfp
My best friends are ESTP  w  and ENFJ  w       My ESTP friend likes pushing people s buttons purely for the fun of it  When it s just the two of us  we brain storm different ideas on how to get under someone s skin  with a prank of some kind  whether it be a friend or someone we secretly dislike  Sometimes we end up going a bit too far and upsetting them  but my friend never backs down and doesn t really understand how she could ve upset the person  I usually end up apologising for the two of us   She does have a soft side though and often comes to me when she s overthinking or worrying about small things  which is often   My ENFJ friend and I have more of an emotional friendship  We mostly have long talks about the future and our aspirations  We get along quite well  however  she can be extremely dramatic and dishonest about things to try and get validation  She has a habit of lying to the people around her  but she knows that I can see through it so she s more open to me about her problems and frequently comes to me for advice as we share similar problems    some other friends of mine are ESTP  W   ENFP  W   ISFJ  w   INTP  w   ISTP  w   ESTP  w   ENTP  w  and ENTP  w ,enfp
my best friends are ENFP  w   ENFP  w  and ENFJ  w   D,enfp

My best friend is an INTP  w   he s the one who got me on this site   He s also the reason i love INTPs  He cares about me so much and is always worried  although he s too shy to show it   I can tell by his cute way of showing affection  sometimes he doesn t know what to do when I m sad so he just runs to a shop to get me my favorite sweet   Once I had been holding my tears the whole day  until something happen and I burst into tears in front of him    although I promised myself not to do so again because I m annoying him    and he was just puzzled his expression was too stupid   it took him totally   minutes only to pat my head   I m so so so grateful to you   ,enfp

pretty much my opposite i d say  not exactly  but close,enfp
I suspected she was an ENTP and when I had her take the test I got confirmation  Our WhatsApp convos are a weird mixture of jokes  rants about stupid people  serious world problems and cat memes ,enfp
Best friend for half my life but we fell out recently  Suprsingly  not because of our very different mbti types clashing  No  despite us cognitively being different we got alone well before this  We literally never argued and on the outside we acted similarly  It was actually our enneagrams that clashed   As a    I cannot supress what I believe  or lie about who I am  even for my own good or to save my relationships  If I think something is wrong I will not shut up about it even if I have to be alone as a result  But as a    she couldn t stay loyal to her beliefs or me if it risked her security  socially  I never endangered her lol   She valued her security more  she wanted a big safe bubble of friends around her       even if she didn t like them  even if they went against everything she said she hated  and even if she had to lie and talk bad about me and other people to have it that way   I sound really arrogant  I swear I m not  I can usually admit my own faults in a conflict  But this time is was just crazy how she acted  so cowardly  I can say safely I did not do anything wrong here  It s her choice though  I don t regret sticking to my guns rather than being fake even though I m sad we aren t friends anymore  ALSO this isn t to say all  s are disloyal  most  s aren t like her but her enneagram was relevant to her motivations  One of two new best  friends is ISFP  w  and she s great  not fake at all ,enfp
our dynamic is like me  IM GOING TO COMMIT A CRIME my best  NO,enfp
XXTJ P  girls are most compatible for me as friends can t stand feeling girls just ugh yall snowflakes too sensitive feministic and tolerance obsessed and kinda stupid imho  ESFP boys turn me on   not all though some are dum XXTJ guys are too serious or T in general are too boring for me  I need some cryboys so my ego is satisfied ty,enfp

   He is planning a revolution    He can stay up until   am    He is interested in chemistry    Does not play chess well  like me     Hates injustice    He loves mysticism   Jack of all trades    Believes that an ideal world is possible without money   Caring      Despises those who are wrong  in his opinion      He is afraid of death     Incorruptible,enfp

My best friend for the past three years  It s always fun to talk to him since he is like the opposite of me in many ways  and it s a good thing because he makes sure to not sugarcoat things for me  even though he can harsh sometimes  Plus he encouraged me to start running since I suck at it  and I help him with building his empathy with people ,enfp
i wouldn t say we re on best friend terms so i won t vote but she s my only friend i kept from high school i think she s ISTP  w  sp dom     RCOEI choleric melancholic  i m unsure if she s sp sx or sp so because both seem to fit her decently anyway yeah she s really different to me   hard to understand  extremely intelligent and goal oriented though  had some issues with her but all g  and i thought i wouldn t speak to her ever again after high school but she s the only friend who s stuck with me so i m pretty grateful for that lol,enfp

Small note but at least the ESTPs in my life are such amazing storytellers  It s never too grandiose and they choose the right details that will captivate their audience in the best way  Their ramblings are always ones I never tire to hear,enfp
She s the school s primadonna,enfp

Friends  Listed in vote  she s scary  and tall  and aggro  and lands people in the dirt  However  she s generally the nicest person ever the moment someone is genuinely hurt and upset  Has a plan for the next ten years  and we roast economic theory  Awesome        ENTP  w   w       our local chad  He s fun  but talks in riddles  and I can t ever tell if he s joking  Still awesome  and surprisingly good with kids  INFP  w       really uncomfortable with conflict  Shy and reserved when she s uncomfortable  but once she warms up  she ll talk for hours about the characters she s written and the story around them  Lovely  would recommend  ESTP  w   w       she actually is not a chad  She s really mellow  but brings out the troll in people  Loves sports  is happy to listen to our nerdy nonsense even if she s not into it herself  Always has my back  and understands what I m trying to say  Amazing ENFP  w       uber dramatic  but genuinely kind  Incredibly high self esteem  but not arrogant  Creative  lazy  and all around lovely  INFP  w       she is a little quirky  she is obsessed with Tolkien  correct definitions  had a lengthy explanation of the difference between a scullery maid and a house servant  same for brigade and platoon   and fantasy  She has very set  unquestionable opinions  but is otherwise very friendly ISTP  w   w       flipping adorable  Logical boi  but loves kids  pokemon  and baking  Expresses love in concrete terms  offering the last of something  giving someone a little extra  finding something that makes them smile  etc   Basically  he s the reason I m in love with ISTPs  INFP  w       he s really mellow and intensely dramatic  Self deprecating in order to bring people together  but has a softer Fi  Has planned countless stories  started a dozen  and dropped them all  Possible ENFP  ENFP  w       loves to encourage other people to do stupid things that she thought up  gets self conscious and anxious when she is involved  Funny  and is really friendly  That s    longer than I was expecting  Trends I noticed  a LOT of  s  and a LOT of XNFPs ,enfp
He s surprisingly chill for an ENTP  and dislikes people that are all over the place or too  quirky   which is also a surprise  Very obvious  w   really concerned with projecting an image  The paragon of Ne Ti  constantly trying to find loopholes and inconsistencies without trying to use it to build a personal system out of it  Constantly using Si in the funniest  and worst  ways  it s funny to see  LIE    ILE intertype relationships are spot on too  it s funny because he s highly skeptical of MBTI and believes himself to be untypable,enfp

I have two close friends  both of whom I got close to during the course of the pandemic through endless texting  Wouldn t have been able to do it face to face      My INFJ friend is the most enjoyable conversationalist I ve ever met in my life  and although her Ni dom cynicism shocks me sometimes  she keeps me grounded  She has such nuanced opinions on things that I m kind of jealous  ngl  She s also an overall uncertified therapist   My other friend is an ESFP  which is ironic  because the kinds of conversations I have with her couldn t have been more different than the ones I have with my INFJ friend lol  She s one of the friendliest and most understanding people I know   Idk how to end my comment  bye,enfp

Never had a  best  friend  since none of mine stay around for long  but a few good friends I had were  ISTP ISFP and ISFJ  specifically  w   I just realized how much I attract sensors ,enfp
Sweetest freaking person I know  Incredibly intelligent  silly  eccentric  and fun  I have really entertaining but also philosophical and meaningful discussions with them and they re probably the most emotionally supportive person I ve met ,enfp
She got ENFP on   p  and she told me that after reading every description of the    types  she relates a lot more to the ENFP description   BUT I m having a very hard time imagining this adrenaline junkie as Ne dom      she look dead inside everytime i try to use more my Ne around her D     After   years  she finally accepted to take the enneagram test  i was confused between   or   for her  and she got eg   so i guess imma type her as such before looking more deeply into her personality   ,enfp
I think enneagram relate much more than i thought   ,enfp
We re the same  but also different  It s so interesting to get to see the world from your pov  It s never boring around you  you always encourage me to get out of my comfort zone and try new things  You are the best ,enfp
as you can tell we re cool      ,enfp
The iconic ENTP and INFJ duo comin  to overthrow the government    j  I very much appreciate my INFJ bestie  we balance eachother out very nicely  She s very good at advice and actually listens to my rad ideas and understands them  Fun fact  we ve known eachother for maybe   years and she thought I was annoying for like   of those years   ,enfp
my best friend is the type above  INFP  w  sp sx y get it   but i have other friends  theyre not my best friends tho    ISFP  w   w  XwX so sx IEE C melancholic phlegmatic RLUAI  workaholic artist who seeks to be very good at art  idk if they re core  w  or  w  tbh but i think i persoanlly see more  w  since he wants to make an impact on twitter and be popular by showing off his uniqueness and the like  i can also see core  w  in the sense that he seems to talk a lot about seeking harmony and peace and doesnt really like drama  his   wing is also apparent cuz he can be straightforward and blunt in public sometimes  but ill go with the latter  w   also i now think IEE because i see him valuing Te a lot and based off what he says abt his dad i can see IEE SLI duality here  also his art and overall vibes just reeks so much of that of IEE    INFJ  w   w   w  sx sp EII   H phlegmatic RCxAI  theyre very calm  kind  and understanding  i see lots of Fe in them tbh   they could even be ENFJ but i think INFJ makes a bit more sense    ISFP  w   w   w  so sp melancholic phlegmatic SEI xLUAI  INFP  w   w   w  so sx melancholic sanguine IEI xLUAI  hcrny depressed furry  i will just say that much   IxTP  w   w   w  sp sx phlegmatic SLI RLUEx  very laid back  funny  and friendly  hes also a furry but hes probably the least outwardly and openly uwu person out of all these people  he kind of reminds me of crit kal tbh ,enfp

He said he got INFJ on   Personalities  but tbh I m not so sure  The numbers were super close between INFJ  INTJ and INTP  and while I definitely see Ti Fe  I m pretty sure he s Ne Si on the perceiving axis  He s more of a polymath than I am and doesn t seem to struggle as much with detailwork as I do  He also says he has trouble pinpointing the future from all the ideas he creates whereas I m better at making the ideas and strand converge  His Fe would be quite strong but he can be a bit oblivious and meek when faced with decisions and social obligations  I ve known him forever though  since we were toddlers and we ve never so much as argued  Not once  We don t see each other often but when we do  you know it ll be a hell of a time ,enfp

I m gonna be a stereotypical ENTP here but   my best friend is an INFJ lmaooo  We click really well because she s like the only person who will listen to my ridiculous ideas and schemes  while I actively reach out to her when not too many others do    I also have another really close friend who I thinkkkkk is an ISFP or maybeee an ISTP  I m not sure yet   We do clash on alot of stuff because we have differing opinions about them  and their opinions are verrrry strong while I tend to be more open to debate ,enfp
my friend group   me  ENFJ  w  s o  ESFJ  w  friend two  ESFP  w  friend three  ENTJ  w  friend four  ENFP  w  friend five  xntp  w ,enfp
ENFP  w  I literally love them  they are one of my favorite types  of course they are a little disobedient at times  As a true chico malo I told him that my irony does not deserve it when I use it on him because he is stupid or Nature is not always perfect     but with you he really exaggerated  He goes to try with the girls younger than him and it scares me  I think he is a psychopath  in fact I recommended a psychologist   psychiatrist but he never listens to me  Sometimes people take it as a Caballo Homosexual De Las Monta as   but I love him so much peace,enfp
ugHhh she s the absolute best ever    just super fun to hang around we have such thoughtful intresting conversations    anyways yes INFJ  w  appreciation   ,enfp
My best friend  both are introverted and thinkers  i m the clown and she s the sensible  my INTJ friend ,enfp
i literally cant pick just one so  ESFP  w   she can really be mean sometimes i dont think she s aware tho so its ok i love her  and i may have crushed on her for about a year       bye so embarassing  ENTP  w   we always used to back each other up in everything and overshare everything in a good way   i feel like a si dom around her   also like she s so cute and bubbly  she s the smartest person i ve met and she keeps telling me she only trusts me for some reason it makes me feel so special     ESTJ  w   i love her smm she switches between being really serious and acting  crackheadly  wtf   so yeahh i love her si ne sm tho  now that i think about it i think she is my best friend so ima change the vote to her  she s always so supportive and mature i love her sm   ESFJ  w   um ig the one im closest to and regret the most and was so hard to type n e ways  i know her so well but i feel like she only uses fe i struggled a lot to type her FHSKNF honestly i cant see her as any type so it feels weird   ISTP  w   she s so cool but sometimes i feel like she hates me we re not that close  our opinions are so similar sometimes its like reading minds idk how to explain   INFJ  w   idk if i mistyped her bc our brains like literally work in sync in the exact same way  and she s like the person i share the most common interests with yayy but i dont really see the loud ne i have in her   she gives very healthy stable fe vibes tho also when i taught her about functions on the surface level she claimed to be a ni dom sooo   edit  it feels so weird that i wont be seeing any of them anymore now that im switching schools   except for the ESFJ one we are ibfs lol  kind of an unfair thing to say but i think ill miss ESTJ and ENTP mainly  ,enfp
I love this girl more than anything  My ride or die bestie who causes trouble with me while Im in Se grip and she s in loop        ,enfp
  ENTJ and another    INFJ          ESTP,enfp
Most of my friends are  healthy  ENFPs and INFPs  weird thing is they all adore me  they say they really love the way i act  It s weird because i am not really kind of person NFs can like  Maybe INFJs but it s still weird ,enfp
The group is decentralized bc of internships and college graduations  but my social circle looks a little like this  INFJ  das me   ISFP  best friend from childhood   ENTJ  INTP  the only majority digital relationship I ve been able to keep   INFP  ISTP  and an ISTJ  It s kinda funnt looking at it  my general aquatence circle is filled with tons of extroverts but I mostly wrangled other introverts in for my close friend group as a kid ,enfp
he was the only person who still talked to me in quarentine  and i am greatful for that,enfp
i have   best friends  not in the same group  and   of them are  w s,enfp
Types of people in my friend group  in no particular order    INFP  w   me   INFx  w   INFP  w   ENFJ  w   ENTJ  w   INFJ  w   INFJ  w   INFJ  w  and ISFP  w   I love all of them so much  I always thought since we re a group of   it would be really interesting if each of us had different enneagram types  but then maybe we couldn t get along that well lol,enfp
I have   best friends  one is the closest person to be Barney Stinson and the another one is the live action of Shrek,enfp

my friend group  me  INFP    ESFJ    ISTP    ENFP    ExFJ idk    ISFJ ofc none of them fit the types perfectly except friend   is literally a stereotypical ENFP i m closest to    ESFJ  i made her take sakinorva and she got INFJ lol but she s not an ni dom      she might be ENFJ but her Se is so bad ,enfp

I m not a big fan of the concept of best friends  or any hierarchy between friendships  for that matter   but at this point in life I m probably closest to my ESFJ  w  friend  who is also the most obvious Fe dom I ve ever met  lol  The other two in our friend group are an ISFP  w   she and I are pretty close as well  and an ISTJ  w  ,enfp
i made my best friend take the test once and he got ESFJ and i believe that s accurate  he is the person with the most Fe i have ever met  as for his enneagram     he once told me he is afraid of feeling pain and a secondary fear is having no security so    ,enfp
Help me,enfp
i feel like everyone needs an ENFJ in their life  D,enfp
I don t have nor have a need for friends  I voted for myself,enfp
i don t think that personality types have to do much with who you re closest with  but that s probably because of my personal experience   i mean  i met the closest person to my heart only because of some circumstances and one single interest that we shared back in primary school  we didn t even plan on becoming friends until few years of spending time together and just getting used to each other s company  but i m really happy for everyone in this comment section  it s amazing that you could find someone so close to you ,enfp
He s so hard to understand  I don t even know if i typed him correctly  I mean i m not sure about it at all ,enfp

I actually broke the tie  lol  He s an ENFP ,enfp
I think she s an ISFP and my other one is an ESFJ ,enfp
I only have one friend in real life for now and he s my bestfriend ,enfp
They balance out how way too logical I am with things  Let s me see things in a new lens  but also really fun  Chaotic and unfiltered but never annoying  Always keeps excitement levels high and brings something new to the table everyday  but knows when to get serious and helps me out when I m feeling down  Might not be my ideal typing  but damn if they ain t a great best friend to have ,enfp
she would probably never take mbti ever but     here s a try,enfp
she s a lot more authoritative than i am but i m also a lot more orderly and we conflict in that aspect but we also have a really good dynamic together,enfp
Two Ne doms together means pure chaos and the occasional deep talks ,enfp
Sometimes when my INFP friend burst their emotions  I just give a little comfort or sometimes low key ignore  when I find it irrelevant or I don t have the mood for comforting someone   It s just the thing where FiNe really stands out in her life choices  that clashes with my SiTe   sighs   Anyway  we always understood our own opinions and insights on different things  even find comfort to one another  Although I think to myself that I m not good at comforting ,enfp
People thought the two of us we re crazy ,enfp
You INTPs are such amazing people for so many reasons you dont take any credit for,enfp
 INTP  w   ESFx  w   ENFP  w   My Fe needs more friends  ,enfp

No shared functions but we bring out the best in eachother  I do weird her out alot I m sure ,enfp
very mom ish in the  im going to be overbearing and you need to do what i say and im going to yell at you to knock you out of your issues  way but shes loyal and stuck by me as i did her and i love her,enfp
my closest friend in the world is an ENFP just like me  we understand each other so much HAHA  wouldn t want to have it any other way    ,enfp

my closest friend is an INFJ  then there s ENFP  ESTP  and INTP,enfp
Literally friends with   INTPs    ENFP    ISFJ    ENTPs  and   ESTJ,enfp
One of the nicest and most supportive people I ve ever meet  We ve been friends for   years now  and even lasted through periods of little to no communication  The only person who I can truly be myself around and not feel any guilt  We click extremely well despite having drastically different interests  She s the only person that I could listen to rant about something I have absolutely no interest in  and yet still feel fulfilled  She s literally saved my life  and I owe her the world  Our friendship just keeps getting stronger  and she s the one person I never want to lose  We had some confusion about her type for a while  but I m fairly confident in this  It s a wonder how she puts up with me on a daily basis  She knows almost every detail about my past  who I used to be  the times I ve        up or lost control  and yet hasn t judged me one bit  It s hard to even argue with her in a friendly way  Our banter back and forth never feels forced  but never feels wrong  She the only person I ve met who I can spend hours with and not be completely socially drained afterwards  I m so glad that we became friends  and I wouldn t trade it for the world ,enfp
i love her so much  she keeps me grounded  ,enfp
Here are my closest friends   INTP  w   the one everyone loves around cause he is chill ASF  ENFP  w   the funny friend everyone wants around  ESFP  w   boss  Tough on the outside  cute on the inside  INFJ  w   intellect of the group  mumbles about philosophy   ISFJ  w   cute friend    goes along,enfp
I have   best friends who are both INFP lol,enfp
Fi dom for sure  and I personally can see Ne   Se  As for the enneagram  I ve thought of both    with either wing  but I lean    and  w  ,enfp
I used to be best friends with an ISFP girl  until our Fi s completely crashed against each other    yeah    But I still have a male best friend  pretty sure an ISTJ  It seems I get along quite well with the Te Fi axis  what a surprise ,enfp
idk why we get along but we do,enfp
she is totally the ISTP stereotype  and i love her   my other best friends types   INFP  w    he is cute af and into mbti ENFP  w    crazy bubbly girl ENTP  w    he scares me ENFP  w    i love that artsy guy ESFP  w    he doesnt look ESFP at first  but his se fi use is really high  ISFP  w    almost an egirl  cute ,enfp
This is sad  but we re no longer even acquaintances anymore  Here s what happened in chronological order   Met each other in school cafeteria when I was new to the school  this happened in  th grade   Instant chemistry and began bonding together over Nintendo videogames and anime  We both were quirky outcasts who liked to act like weirdos and we overall shared a lot of experiences together   HappinessNoise jpg  She fell in love with me but didn t tell me directly but instead she would draw pictures of me looking cool with positive words like  awesome   or  noble     She moved away and we hugged goodbye   BigSad exe  I eventually develop feelings for her and very nervously confess to her over Miiverse on my WiiU  She confesses her love back   HappinessNoise jpg again  Spend   years communicating over Swapnote and later Swapdoodle on the  DS sharing affection towards each other and having fun and quirky conversations  ex  She d talk about how she d hack her  DS and create these cool mods  One time she made an app that rickrolls you when you open it   We make a promise to get married when we get older   One day she said she wants to go back to best friend status  I cry for a long time but my stubborn ass wanted to still be lovers because my love for her was too strong to be able to go back to when we were friends   She d numerously attempt to shut down the relationship because she lost her feelings for me while I futilely tried to revive our love connection to the point of obsessiveness because I couldn t handle being in the friend zone when I loved her too much   She messages me less frequently and her communication towards me is more detached and cold while I try to be as warm and affectionate towards her as I can to try winning her back  She also mentioned that she didn t really mean the promise and that she wasn t really interested in marrying me   I give up and try to at least keep our friendship alive   Now she doesn t even want to be friends and suddenly stops messaging me  When I try to reach out to her asking what I did wrong and how I could make up for it she d delete my messages not answer my calls  And if she picked up the phone by accident then she d immediately hang up   I become desperate and try to go the extra mile by posting private youtube videos on my channel meant specially for her where I pour my heart out to her and tell her how much I miss her   She eventually cuts off all forms of communication with me  rendering it impossible for me to contact her  She even moved so I couldn t mail to her since she didn t tell me her new address   I proceed to be filled with depression and regret for another   years cause I lost her forever and I feel like it was all my fault that she cut me out of her life   After the   years pass I try to erase her from my memory via forcing myself to not think about her so I can stop getting teared up everytime I think about her and so I can ease the pain  I also try to use rationalization to trick myself into forming a mentality that I can be okay without her and that makes me choose to be single my whole life on purpose  This caused my instinctual stack to change from sx sp to sp sx   It eventually worked and I lost all love and emotion towards her but if I m not careful I ll remember our happy moments together and then the sadness and regret come back   The tragic thing is that she was literally the closest and kindest person I ve ever had in my life and to this day I have never met anyone else who was as holy as her or like her  And the fact that she was an xNFP makes me feel like I lost a soulmate that I can t have again  Everyone says that the INFJ xNFP pair is perfect for relationships  but to me  all it caused was pain  It s been   years since she last talked to me but I still often wish I could see her again to this day     Oh my beloved         Edit  She didn t take the test so I had to take my best guess  It was between ENFP  ENTP  or INFP for mbti and for enneagram it was between  w    w   or  w   ENFP  w  seems the most like her for now  Or maybe INFP  Ahhh idk ,enfp
my whole friend group are INFPs so when we mess around and get in trouble at school i have to reassure them all because they get sensitive on me  ,enfp
sweet  introverted  hilarious  puts his friends needs above his own  tends to keep his problems to himself until it s too much  He listens to me go on random tangents about my new weekly obsessions  and listens to my stories  He also adopted my speech patterns and the way I would text after a few months of knowing each other  There s never moments of silence when we re on calls  I m usually the person he talks to if he s having a problem or needs to vent   I really don t feel I deserve him at times    ,enfp
So  here I am trying to guess my closest friends  types   some of them took MBTI tests but not all of them  From oldest to newest friends     ENFJ  w  so sp Phlegmatic Choleric    ENTJ  w  sx sp Choleric    ISFJ  w  so sp Phlegmatic    ISFP  w  sx so Sanguine    ISTJ  w  sp sx Melancholic Choleric    INFJ  w  sp sx Phlegmatic Melancholic,enfp
All of my close friends are xNTx and it shines through in my personality,enfp
I got to thinking and its really interesting how we always agree on things and generally think the same  We must have different thought processes  but we always end up with the same conclusion  For example  we both are against the death penalty  Her reasoning is because it s horrible that they are taking a persons life and that s it s murder  and while I haven t thought about it much  dang so blindness   my reasoning is more so they should try to rehabilitate them and if you aren t for that  life in prison is more of a punishment anyway    Also without I d probably be failing English and she d probably be failing math lol  It works out great ,enfp
I m sure if she learned about MBTI she d think she s INFP or INxJ,enfp
She s awesome  Though sometimes our aux functions clash cuz Fe and Te are very different,enfp
He s weird  isn t he ,enfp
ENFP   INFP   BFFs  lol,enfp
Took a while but I finally found out his type  My other best friend is an INFP who s enneagram I am not sure ,enfp
INTJ x ISTP female duo is something you don t see often,enfp
everyone is the same,enfp
i m ENFP  w  chaotic neutral  and he s INTJ  w  neutral evil,enfp
ENTJ   ESFJ   ENFJ    ENFP   ESFP       me   INTP  D,enfp
Irreplacable  competitive and sensitive Queenie,enfp
It s funny how I thought I had a lot of friends but couldn t think of anyone as my best friend  anyway  he s my best friend rn we are so different yet no one understands me the way he does even tho he hurts me sometimes with his sarcasm but I learned how to roast him back and get over it instead of getting annoyed  he s secretly a cinnamon roll and will get annoyed if I told him that he s cute  I have another best friend who s an ISFP we understand each other really well we re really similar and different at the same time  idk how     but she s one of the few real friends and I will always love her for being so real and not fake  I had a best friend when I was younger  ESTP  I consider my relationship with her as one of the longest relationships  we used to fight a lot yet no one could ever protect me the way she did she would beat that one child that used to annoy me and I miss her so much   In middle school I had a best friend  ENTP  but she s no longer talking to me and calls me dramatic whenever I say that she s changing towards me    I saw that she became friends with some new girls but anyway I wish her the best she was a great friend one day   I also have an ESFJ friend but she likes gossiping and I really hate this so I don t really hang out with her so much but she s a nice friend that will help you  These are the closest ones or at least the real ones,enfp
ENTJ  w   INFP  w    Both aren t too healthy with problems of their own I just hang out with them sometimes ,enfp
wish she had this app then I could show her how much I love her my ENTP best friend        one of my other freinds is ESFJ and like her too much and I had a ESTJ freind we were best friends but one day everything was broke  and now I have a new ISTP friend we re really good freinds   but our friendship could be better if she get away from smoking  |,enfp
ENTP  w   ENFP  w   INFP  w   So much Ne lol,enfp
my closest friends are INFJ  ENTP and INFP,enfp
We re so similar but so different at the same time lol,enfp
not my best friend but it s the only one i m sure of it s type spends a lot of time in his Se grip i can t deal with his suffering for people not liking him  i m almost ending our friendship i feel sorry for him actually but it s getting on my nerves already,enfp
Yeah,enfp
some of my best friends types ESFP  w      probably ENFP or ISFP and im guessing    isfx either  wx  w   wx or  w  im not sure INFP  w   w   w ,enfp

She s quite reserved but she s really nice  accepting  and open minded  she can bear my weirdness and randomness,enfp
ISTP  w   Bada s  cool n chill  very honest and open minded  always helpful and a great listener  I love her so dearly and so much i m glad i met her,enfp
INFPs make the best friends  They re just so loyal and true ,enfp
ENTP  he argues for the sake of arguing most of the time  I just listen and keep calm ,enfp
i still can t type my best best friend  and he can t type himself either  he surely is a Fe user and he s a big simp with definite   as enneagram  other ones are ENTP  ISFJ  ISTP and INTP,enfp
The definition of Chaotic Neutral  Ni inf  and sp blind but they re very fun to be around ,enfp
They cant go through life without having a s o Lmaoo   days after a breakup and they already have another bf  refuses to change and thinks im attacking them when i try to help but i love them sm   ,enfp
a,enfp
Awesomesauce ENFP ENTP friendship,enfp
good combine after all,enfp
chefs kiss we re both too moody and sensitive though,enfp
I have two main  but the one that stuck out for me the longest was INTP  The other one is INTJ,enfp
I love her to bits and pieces but she s just very    complicated   She always talks about her emotions and tries to fix and organize them but fails miserably  That s usually when I send her some support texts  She s definitely very emotional  She s the type to say  you wouldn t understand   so I tend to just give her time to settle down and figure herself out a little before comforting her  She s very hyper though  She likes playing DnD and she s always talking about the campaign she s doing  She s creative and likes showing off a lot  Deep down  she is genuinely nice but she does tend to push others away  It s funny how she s an Fi dom and I m a Fe dom  We really contrast each other like she s a tomboy while I m an egirl  I m popular but she detests the other popular kids  She gets easily provoked whilse I m calm and unproblematic  She puts too much stress on herself and tends to cause most of her problems but I can tell she s trying really hard to become better   Edit  She recently took the sakinorva test and got ISTJ  It s hard to tell since both ISTJs and INFPs have the same function stack but I find her Fi to be stronger than any of her other functions  I do see how she would get a Si dominant on the test though  seeing as she s usually cautious of new situations and always trying to better herself  But she ll always be an Fi dominant to me because she usually does whatever her heart tells her to and one of her biggest flaws seems to be the fact that she s really sus of people who don t have an      trust level with her  which just seems like a Fi thing ,enfp
fi doms and fe doms go well together,enfp
we have opposite types yet get along so well edit  nvm theyre INTP  ,enfp
She is my therapist and I m her inner demon lol,enfp
All the best friends I ve ever had are all xNFP  lol,enfp
Yup she s really my best friend but the thing is we have a lot of fights nowadays but we also quickly solve them out  I also have other friends but I don t like them as much I do to her,enfp
One day we were on the phone and she was also doing her virtual schooling  Since she muted her mic I started rapping but somehow the school heard me  so I ran out and cried ,enfp
i love her to death,enfp
She s such an obvious so sx chaotic good it s scary  She knows practically everything there is to know about political issues  which is crazy to me  because I hate politics and don t even know who is running for what office in elections  All of her political opinions are very strongly backed by facts and she likes debating people about it  If I didn t have her I d be totally lost    Another cool difference between us  She s much more inclined to English and history  whereas I m much more inclined to math and science  so we work perfectly together  We both suck at explaining things  but after knowing each other for    years  we understand each other just fine   Also the whole knowing her for     years feeds my sx sp soul and I love it ,enfp
Best and most caring friend ever  INFP core  s are rare ,enfp
Got a new best friend hehe,enfp
I have   ENFP real life friends  they are so nice lol,enfp
I have a lot of variety tbh     INFPs    ISFP     ENFJ    ESTP and   ISFJ,enfp
INFP   better off alone ,enfp
I got myself an ESTJ bestie in college haha  Ti x Te supremacy,enfp
i kinda made her do the test one day and she got ENFP  but i m pretty sure she s actually an ENTP not sure about the other      like enneagram n stuff cuz i m a noob,enfp
I like her   i hope you find my message  Nurlytan,enfp
I love her  My other besties too   I have an INFJ  an ISFJ and also an ISFP   Edit  I found a very good friend recently and she s an ENFP,enfp
same as me,enfp
I really love her  I ve never loved someone that much,enfp
i admit that i get annoyed by my bestfriend,enfp
She s an absolute debunker of mbti stereotypes   It s pretty funny everyday but also the most exhausting combination lol ,enfp
I had a kinda friend in a primary school  she was ESFP  Then I got another  she also was ESFP  Now I have the only one friend  he is also a f    ng ESFP  Seems like I am the ultimate magnet for ESFPs,enfp
Me  INFJ  w      sp so Melancholic Phlegmatic Lawful Good  My Ride or die bestie  ENFP  w          so sx Sanguine Phlegmatic Chaotic Good  He s legitimately my favorite person alive ,enfp
Me  an INTP  being best friends with ESFP   Those who believe in the matches   blue screen of death ,enfp
she s a pessimistic ENFJ  best ENFJ ever  no toxic positivity ,enfp
INFP and ISTP supremacy,enfp
It s hard to type someone with little to no personality  But he seems to prioritize Se Fi and he has Ti polr,enfp
ISFJ is a really good friend  Loyal to the end ,enfp
good for that people who have a friend like us ENTP   ,enfp
My b b tch  ,enfp
What if I don t have a best friend because everyone keeps moving out of the country,enfp
ISFP and INTP    ,enfp
Having a best friend is obsolete already  being a recluse is the  new sexy  ,enfp
Very obvious dominant Ni  strong and healthy Aux Fe  very well developed tertrary Ti and quite okayish inferior Se  We were classmates throughout the entirety of middle school and  especially in our first year  she was my biggest help all the way through  I m not sure if I d be able to take care of myself without her back then  because throughout the first two years  I was very anxious  sensitive  stubborn and my Fi was all over the place  Fortunately  I ve matured over time  and most of it is thanks to her  I m so incredibly thankful that we re still in touch  She s kind  loyal  suportive  passionate and I still feel like she understands me better than pretty much everyone else in the world  I don t deserve her  to be honest  We are pretty boring  but we have a very stable and loving connection   I have a few more friends other than her  including an ISTP  w  and an ENFJ  w   both surprisingly healthy   but that s for another story ,enfp
Which one  however  I guess i m going to write all of them     The best friend in real life within a few kilometers of distance  ESTP  w       The online friend who lives in the same country  is very mentally relatable  but can t be interacted with in real life  INFJ  w       The online friend who lives in the neighbouring country and with whom i play multiplayer games  ENTP  w       And  the wholesome but secretive online friend who lives far  far away  ISFJ  w     ,enfp
I have   but the first was ISTP and he was my only best friend for a very long time  The other   are ESFP and INFJ which is hilarious to me  Also becoming really close with an INTP so she ll most definitely be the  th edition  Wow  can t believe i mentioned information about myself without my addiction to lying taking charge  D,enfp
i have more than one so i m going to write all bc  ENTJ  w  be  ENFJ  w  sb  ESFJ  w   w  i guess zy  i dont know her type but i think she is ESXP  w  or  w  at  ENTP  w  zk  ENTP  w  and i adore every one of them  the ENTJ one is my intellegent side and she is my third eye  i matched most with the ENFJ one  she is my proud mommy  the ESFJ one is always be with me in every fault mistake i ve made  the ESXP one is the most complicated person i ve ever met  she judges me when i ask and it feels right to be with her  the ENTP ones protect me every step in my life  soo i can t decide which is my bestest friend  ,enfp
My dream BFF type      Wondering how many people in the entire world have genuinely true friends    must be nice ayyy,enfp
yes  best friend,enfp
She s honestly one of the hardest people to type but ISFJ makes sense imo  My other best friend is the clearest ENFJ you ll ever meet ,enfp
I have more than one  just flexing   ,enfp
i don t have one,enfp
We re complete opposites but she s still        ,enfp
Him and also   ESFP  w      true neutral,enfp
i actually have three best friends  INTP  ENTP and ESFP,enfp
Y otro v nculo m s cercano INFP,enfp
I wish I could vote multiple times,enfp
i met my best friend when she was three years old and i was four at a party at her house  she didn t let me touch her books  next day  she winds up in the same montessori  she stayed one more year than me  the overlap didn t last very long  school as me  very high se  clear fi  well developed tert te  and okayish ni ,enfp
wish I could vote for more than one type,enfp
not   intxs saying they don t have friends,enfp
Shoutout to my homie  hoyromeo,enfp
She s one of the best people I ve ever met   ,enfp
I love him,enfp
We always know what the other is thinking lol,enfp
best girl friends    INFP s  ISFP   best guy friends  ISTP AND ISTJ  definitely unexpected matches with me hehe ,enfp
Definitely thinks herself an INFP because she only knows her   p results and never looked any further,enfp
The intuitive bias here is undeniable ,enfp
i make friends with the craziest people ,enfp
I don t think I have a best friend   ,enfp
Very strong morals loud sensitive lies a lot very ambitious messy a player assertive but sometimes shy hides pain with jokes talks back can t handle unfairness,enfp
INFJ ENFP friendship forever,enfp
me and my best friend became friends because we r both INFJs and now i love him more than life itself   ,enfp
ISFPs are so undereated T T,enfp
we have to deal with distance a lot but we re going okay   ,enfp
I have   friends who are INFPs ,enfp
tfw ur   closest irl friends have the exact same type,enfp
My friend of    years and we have never even fought once  one of the two people I can be myself around along with my ENTJ friend  ,enfp
I found this poll looking on my best friend s page  He made my day  At least  if he s talking about me and not his dog  I would understand if that was the case  though ,enfp
I don t need any best friend     ,enfp
they have taken and researched personality type after personality type yet they still end up as exactly the same as Hajime Hinata  although the they mixed up their tritype a bit for a little variety ,enfp
My best friends are INTP and ENFJ   ,enfp
Okay  so there was this xNFP girl  not sure  if she has more Ne or Fi  I only befriended with  cuz both of us were         alone  Now I m friends with an ENFJ and an ESTP ,enfp
she  the INTJ and i  the ENFP  and hell yeah we are almost married   ,enfp
I ve   bestfriends  ENTP  ENFP and INTJ ,enfp
Im not sure if he is an ESTP or an ESFP but he is still awesome,enfp
How funny is putting her in social situation for no reason ,enfp
i dont want to fall in love with her   ,enfp
He s Fe enough to push my Ti out of the way and spill my Fe,enfp
INFPs fascinate me lol  Observing a Fi dom as an inferior Fi is always interesting   My friend always come to the conclusion  do what feels right to you     You see I don t know what that means   ,enfp
INFJ and an IxTJ pretty swag,enfp
Idk how we are best friends  i like bullying she likes crying,enfp
   luv uuu,enfp
She has a very interesting MBTI   Enneagram combination ,enfp
My best friend is also an ENFP  Why are ENFPs majority of people s best friend in this site  It is easily because they are the most common intuitive type  so both the sensors  intuitives  and other ENFPs can easily find and relate to them compared to other intuitive types  Being an open minded and empathetic feeler also helps a lot  There aren t many INTJ women or INFJ men around so they ll never make it on this kind of list  Rarity itself contributed a lot to one s number of friends   Add  this site is heavily biased for intuitives  Make this poll IRL and ENFPs may still win but there s no fricking way the INFJ would make it to spot    The list would be like ENFPs  ESFPs  ESTPs  ENTPs or some little variation like that lol ,enfp
I didn t choose ENFP    ENFP chose me lol  but also fr       I tend to have the closest relationships with ENFPs and ESFJs  I love literally every introvert  but I m so bad at getting to know them keeping in touch with them   ,enfp
Both my closest friends are xnfj makes a lot of sense now,enfp
Poor guy ,enfp
oop,enfp
I tend to consider my entire group of friends cause I care about all of them  First  there are my   best friends  one ENFJ and the other ISTJ  The ENFJ is really funny  always makes me laugh  but she care too much about others  she is really generous and empathetic  My ISTJ friend instead is very mature and responsible  I find her very strong and determined  My other friends are an ISFP  we help each other to write books or find new ideas  it s cool   an ISFJ  an ENFP  an INTP and   INFPs ,enfp
Best Frenemies for life bb,enfp
Guys I don t know if she s ENFP or ESFP  But anyway I still vote her ENFP,enfp
My ESFP friend facetimes me every day with wild ass stories and she s constantly starting new projects  Shes also super supportive and energetic  keeps me positive lol      ,enfp
Most of my friends are intuitive types,enfp
INTJ otaku,enfp
An ESFP  probably enneagram  ,enfp
He is the embodiment of the word  Chill   I think his trytipe would be  w   w   w  ,enfp
  INFP best friends and   INTJ  And basically     of my friends are INFP ,enfp
Together with her we are sadness and happiness  all in one   Honorable mentions   INTP  she generates the best idea  always  ISFP  fun to play with and we enjoy getting lost when finding our way home  ESFJ I once thought she was an ENFP because of her highly developed Ne  Crime partners since     ENFP  Crazy idea generater  Crime partners since     ISTJ  Always pull a prank on her then she shows me a poker face and then I laugh  She laughs  too  ESFP  Best video games and drawing partner ever ,enfp
Probably the most stereotyped ENFP that has walked on earth ahab A part for his very developed Te perhaps,enfp
i don t exactly know much about his type but he s very sweet   ,enfp
My best friend is Jesus ,enfp
  BurntChickenNugget  He is one of the only few friends I have that actually cares about me    ,enfp
i voted the type of the closest friend ive known for the longest time here but i guess i have multiple best friends     and theyre all feelers why do you guys like me,enfp

He s mean    ,enfp
my closest friend is an INTP  my other friends are another INTP  an infx  and an ENFP,enfp

Both of them,enfp
When you ve been questioning your friends type for ages and finally figure out they re an ISFJ and not INFP and everything just starts to make sense,enfp
ENFJ  INFP and ISFJ  Being the only thinker is hard,enfp
I love you pat no homo  you ve taught me so much and saved my life,enfp
Ne dom  enxp  friends are so fun to have  they could be too much sometimes but they understand my weirdness well lol,enfp
ENFJ INFJ ESTP,enfp
im surprised no one s friend is ESTJ lmao,enfp
The N S friendship is gold tbh,enfp
closest friends are probably ENFJ  ISFP  INTJ  INTP and ISTP,enfp
When i see this I remember my lovely friend   She is the best for real    She really takes care of me  and she is always enthusiastic with me even if she has other works and projects that she put off for me  she always listens to me even when I chat without interest  she make me love myself SM  so I think it s the best MBTI I ve met  but it is not common in the Internet  I m sad for this angelic ESFJ  ,enfp
My closest friend group would be an ENFJ  an ENTJ  an INFJ  an ISTJ   and the other two might be an ISFP and an ISTP but I m not fully sure about their types   ,enfp
An INTP  an ENFP  and a ENTJ all walked into a bar and they are my best friends,enfp
Me who voted my cousin type cuz i don t have a bff,enfp
unfortunately he is an ENTP  it is horrible to live with this plague  I love you  kaosu,enfp

Everyone can be fun or interesting on good times  but only a true friend stays on the worst  For me it s ISTJ  she s so loyal and always supports me  specially in my crazy ideas or activities     I could not be more fortunate ,enfp
Well  I have only two best friends    well  only two friends generally    Best friend     ENTP  they are adventurous  borderline reckless  and have a huge ass charisma  Along with  leadership qualities   w   Best friend     INFP  creative  dramatic  hopeless romantic  and well in tune in their emotions  They are accepting and non judgemental ,enfp
I m surprisingly friends with a lot of ENTJs and I m an ENFJ  I dont know how this is lmao  And then of course there is the INFJ I love with all my heart ,enfp
Only dumb people have friends  I will not repeat myself again  I am an INTJ mastermind with an IQ of      I ve been suffering from loneliness ever since I was a sperm in my daddy s testicles  No other sperms wanted to be around me because they felt dumb when I was talking about quantum encryption and how I m gonna doom everyone on this earth ,enfp
He s an Adrenaline junkie,enfp
imagine ISTJ having two best friends who are ENFP and ENTP  she s down to earth meanwhile I m like Ajsdhdhjbdhdjwnshehjanshejsnhsjeamhsjwnahsjwjahsjwja another cursed idea sjajshhewjwjwhhwhwhwhwhhwhwhwhwhahqhqhqhahqhqhqhhqhq AH I WANT TO BUY A DISH THAT LOOKS LIKE DOG POO TO BRING IT TO U WHEN I WILL MEET U IN RUSSIA IN TWO MONTHS WOOOOOH THAT WILL BE FUN  remembers about the Corona thing  IDGAAAAF and the ENFP one is like OH I WANNA LIVE WITH ALL OF U IN CHINA TOGETHER AND I WANNA BUY A NOTEBOOK          and the ISTJ one is like girls girls come back to the reality and I m like  SCREAMING IN NE DOM  and the ENFP is like  ignoring aggressively ,enfp
he s a good lad,enfp
Unfortunately an unhealthy ISTP  and one that I ve recently had to doorslam  I still like her and wish her the best  but it s not the same anymore   ,enfp
The ultimate dynamic duo,enfp
nonexistent    ,enfp
all my close friends are INTP somehow,enfp
will looked like a goofball when it comes to frivolous talk  but would bother talk about history and politics for hours    so yea,enfp
INFP     Sp Sx  An incredibly curious bookworm with a soft underside  very caring and knowledgeable albeit very private and strong in her convictions  Never have I received such good literature recommendations from anyone  One of the best people and the healthiest Fi dom I ve ever met ,enfp
Acts like an ESFJ or ESFP  but once you get to know her  you realize that s just because she s a    She gets along with everyone she meets and is such a sweet and supportive person  If it wasn t for her helping me come out of my shell I d probably be a nocturnal hermit right now lol,enfp
I don t know what I would have done without him  I love him so much  I now understand what the term  bromance  means  He s there for me and it means the solar system to me ,enfp
ENFJ  ENTP and XSFP,enfp
My best friend is an INFJ ,enfp
Imagine   I have ESFP best friend    ,enfp
Yeah  I m grateful I have her to restrain me My other close friends  INTJ  w  ISFJ  w  ENTP  w  ESTP  w ,enfp
I love you Alli and im going to boil the face of that       that has been threatening to beat you for no reason at all ,enfp
The only person who cares about me,enfp
ni doms don t exist,enfp
I love all ENTPs in this world  fictional too,enfp
I just came here to say that my best friend is the coolest  I want to make an exposition of her  lemme see  an obvious INFP  and she loves it   I think she was the easiest person to type when I started on this  I found out she is  w   w   w  as tritype  She is a person of lofty feelings who always strives to see the good side of people  sometimes it s even annoying that she doesn t believe people can have bad intentions  She is very strict about what she believes is correct  She is true to herself even though other people sometimes don t understand why she asks so many questions or why she s so sentimental sometimes  Is very sweet  She is one of the most tender people I know  She likes to debate until exhaustion even if doesn t lead to anything clear  in stark contrast to me  where I prefer to keep to myself my opinions   She is focused  she is calm  She doesn t like conflict  but she also doesn t avoid confronting when she thinks she has acted wrong  She is the most honest person I could have ever met  She is true to herself and loyal to her friends  She knows herself and knows how to speak about her qualities impartially  but she also knows how to speak about the qualities of others  Sometimes she s as naive as a little child  but she s one of the happiest people with the fact of being alive that I know  She s joyful  she enjoys being alive and I am happy to have met her  She has helped me mature and be optimistic  and I hope no one hurts her because she has a child s heart and deserves all the love in the world ,enfp
what s a friend ,enfp
Troll friend,enfp
Mostly ESFP  Younger days  ESxP and IxFP  At work  ENxx,enfp
She s the best and deserves all the love in the world uwu,enfp
She is my childhood friend  I love her so much  We found out she was an ESTJ few days ago and she totally disliked the ESTJ  machine  stereotype as she is really kind and warm  always trying to do her best  She is not that bad dealing with emotions  but she needs to improve her Ne   My other good friends are ESFPs  lots of them    INFPs and ISTPs ,enfp
ENFP  ESFP  ESTP  sadly i can just vote for one person tho,enfp
Whenever she comes down to my state from her prestigious university to see my NEET a    she always asks me to make an itinerary of what we re going to do when she s over  Unlike my other IRL friends  I don t really have to limit what we can or cannot do  for instance  she s never played a video game but was fine with one of those  things to do  being teaching her how to play CS GO  she is always determined when it comes to getting better at something new  so naturally  she practiced for an hour straight and tried implementing methods I told her was best ,enfp
I owe her my social life  ,enfp
It s like being friends with winnie the pooh  Such a cutiepie   ,enfp
Obviously different people  but we just  get  one another,enfp
I have an INTP and an ISTP,enfp
For some reason all of my friends are extroverts,enfp
INFP  w  and a total sweetheart   ,enfp
He s an ENFP who is heavily into DnD,enfp
We get along really well  i feel like she understands me   ,enfp
I have ENFJ  w   ISFP  w   and ISTJ  w  out of the ones I have typed ,enfp
Conversation I had one time with my INFP friend at night  Okay you want to steal some chips    Yes  from the basement  starts laughing    Alright I ll be the guy in the chair  I need a layout of the land how many floors are there to get to the basement    There s like three   laughs even more    Okay  are the staircases squeaky at all    Only three   Okay avoid those and use a technique where you use the toes of your foot instead of the balls so you make less noise    Okay  laugh  the problem is is that my dad is down there sleeping on the couch       is there anything of value from the basement that you would need    No nothing    Then I would just try to have a chat with the dad give him the usual  I can t sleep  talk   I don t think he s going to care    What chips are they    I don t know    The risk is still worth the reward so I say go ahead and do it  Can you hide the chips anywhere     No I only have a hoodie    But you could use the hoodie pocket right    Oh yeah   that s true  Okay I ll call you back if I get the chips    Okay bye   Two minutes later  I got the chips   Mission success ,enfp
I love Farhan  He s an amazing guy  truly  We have been friends for almost   years now ,enfp
the funniest person i know  literally the personification of most of my favourite ENTP characters  she always encourages me to talk to more people and has helped me make some great friends  idk what id do without her,enfp
she s older than me by a few months but she has the mental age of a   year old and i love her  once after an exam while waiting she started playing  smash bros with her fingers  on her desk,enfp
Wish I had one   ,enfp
ISFP  She loves adrenaline   art   We are so different from each other yet we understand each other   ,enfp
My BFFs  INTP  INFJ  ENFJ  ESTP  ISFJ and ISFP     Love u guys       ,enfp
Everyone tells me I need to stop encouraging his behavior  but I can t help it  ,enfp
Damn the laughs we doo,enfp
Also ESTP  INFP  INTP  ENFP,enfp
We re a grand  efficient duo  Our other best friends are an INTJ and ENTJ  so I named our group chat  TJ Squad   thought about a name having to do with Te but I don t know if they quite understand cognitive functions yet    We ve discussed our plans for world domination  I volunteered to do the paperwork ,enfp
She s so         chill all the time that I can t tell if she s stoned or if that s just her,enfp
she always tries her best to understand everyone  but barley puts any effort into herself  drives me mad,enfp
She s a great person  and one of the few INTPs that are really into art of all kind  also her band just released a cover on YT  she s the singer   could you check it out please  https   youtu be  RjzZcjt  A Thank you  it would mean a lot   ,enfp
He s intelligent  special and plays by his own rules  It gives him a good edge over most people ,enfp
I love my Morty,enfp
Really deep  introspective  authentic and empathetic person  I ve learned a lot from my INFP friend throughout the years,enfp
Don t have any BFF ,enfp
Unrelated  but this currently says INTJ and I don t know where else to put it  so  I realized all INTJ males I know wear stereotypical long coats   And they make them look way cooler and natural than anyone else would    As for my best friends  ISFP   ESTP  but an ISFJ and INTJ are up there  too        ,enfp
Myself ,enfp
Pretty confident he s an INTJ  Started off a bit rocky  but as we both got older and more mature  things worked out much better  I really think we compliment each other in certain areas ,enfp
ENFJ  w       sx so EIE Fe  My best friend of    years  She is mostly very sociable and charismatic  but profoundly sad and mystical deep down  Her use of Fe is great  I am constantly amazed by how easy it is for her to resonate with the atmosphere of the city she lives in or the people around her  Although she seems tough and determined  I sometimes find her too forgiving    Because of her auxiliary Ni  we can discuss abstract nerdy stuff all the time  like politics  psychology  novels  or analysis of the future of our country and the world     The combination of Fe and   kinda makes her a conflicted person    I have other good friends  ESTJ  w       ISFJ  w       ISFP  w        friends of     years ,enfp
Pretty confident this is his type,enfp

An ESFP and ESTP  it s a miracle i ve survived this long with their lack of Ni ,enfp
Only real friend I have   ,enfp
My three closest friends are INTJ  ISTJ and ISFJ  So  when I get super excited about something they give a monotone  that s cool   generally  They sometimes don t know what to do with me   ,enfp
I have known my INFJ bestie for three years now and the worst thing I can say about her is her annoying avoidance of conflict    I aspire to being this nice ,enfp
INFP friends are the best friends ,enfp

Kanye West being Ne inferior is hands down the stupidest   most ridiculous donkey brained goddamn take I ve ever seen  This is living proof that not all opinions should be respected  Absolutely cretinous take,enfp
Lol why is ENFP one of the least agreed upon types on this site  Like there are so few profiles with a clear cut consensus of ENFP and or without dozens and dozens of comments arguing for something completely different ,enfp
he s a clear ENFP  high Ne and Te correlation may have Se tendencies     this sites hatred for ESXP s makes no sense  keep your judgement and bias to yourself and stop typing every celeb who makes a douche move as a n  Se user ,enfp
Kanye as an ISFJ is this site s most brain damaged take yet     I have to admire it,enfp
I thought he changed his name to ye ,enfp
Did someone here watch new OPS video  They claim that he is an INTJ  Now how COULD that be ,enfp

Took til my teen years to develop my Fe,enfp
Child me just acted like a stereotypical Te dom  No idea what was wrong with me,enfp

I was this textbook bully  little demon child until my teen years where my behavior came to be seen as annoying by other kids and they started to put me aside  which made me more level headed due to being traumatized of social isolation ,enfp
yes  a loner nerd with a terrible haircut,enfp
i would answer this but unfortunately i do not remember my childhood at all ,enfp
Being afraid to sleep until the age of    because of things that don t even exist is pretty bad  but I was always taking positive solutions  for example  the characters in the games I played  protected me   When I was going down the middle of a road my mom stopped me and scolded me and said  Are you crazy  You could have died  and then I said  I don t die    When I found out that my life has an end I cried a lot saying repeating over and over  I don t want to die ,enfp
i was the type of kid who would say my whole name  my address  my identity  if i even remembered the numbers  and much more to a complete stranger in the elevator  also wayyy super active  and i liked to empathize with the  back of the class  kids  i think i d be somewhat of a NeFe but that doesn t exist so i d say ENFP,enfp
INFJ or ISFJ maybe ,enfp
I ruled the Playground  Children could only play according to certain rules that I made and if they didn t I threw sand in their eyes    I was a Playground dictator ,enfp
enxp i was a weirdo,enfp
Weirdly I feel like I was more of an ISTJ in my childhood I d most likely type myself as that if I knew what mbti was at the time,enfp
All my family knows me for is  book smarts  and almost winning a geography bee one time    I don t think they understand how people oriented I can be ,enfp
i kind of turned inside out  i was taken advantage of a lot  everything from being severely bullied to being pressured into committing crimes  it completely killed my spirit ,enfp
Just how fast the night changes   ,enfp
Fi Aux mostly  and sometimes dom,enfp
  year old me declaring myself Supreme Leader of the kindergarten  publicly humiliating those who opposed me  declaring war against the rival kindergarten  demonizing minorities and establishing a dystopian regime where all the toys belonged to me and my loyal followers  And the teachers thought it was  cute    ,enfp
I will add enneagram here soon,enfp
I was such a crybaby but now I became alpha  ,enfp
Maybe a combination of ISTP and ESFP lol I used to pretend to be a tomboy and be tough and everything so I have no clue,enfp
i don t know which type stereotype i was fitting as child  but i remember that i was already going in my own way then  i didn t understand why i did have to listen to kindergarten teacher and doing writing patterns  which was boring task  because i wasn t allowed to write like i wanted  but in the same time i wanted to be like other kids in social interactions because i had some sort of problem in this part  i mean that i had problems with emotions  because i don t understand them and i was crying when something not important went wrong for me    also i liked puzzles as a kid and i was very curious about how world is working and when i went to primary school  i begun to read many books about world s history because it was impressed by how world was in the past,enfp
Perfectionists    And       personalities  A place where almost all of us got mistyped in the first place ,enfp
Very impulsive and sensitive There were days where I d purposely not tell my mom about having tests or exams because why not,enfp
i was still a typical Fe dom D,enfp
I was totally an imaginative and talkative Ne Dom kid  pushing a lot of Ne Fi with a   core that easily disintegrates into   ,enfp
Cute nerd  And a teddy bear  because i have been tall af,enfp

i m torn between   or  ,enfp
She s so crazzzzzzzy  Love her   ,enfp
since she is still too young to be typed but from what i see   definitely se dom aux  xsxp   big five possibly sluen  edit  i also just remembered about how she is hard to grasp the meaning using metaphors and stuff  even the very simple ones  and usually prefer more straight forward way of speaking kinda make me think of ni inf but well since she is still very young  and i can be very wrong haha  so we will see what her functions be like in the future,enfp
Most mentally healthy person of my family,enfp
does anyone else also have a same type sibling ,enfp
It s obvious that my mum like her much than me always tells me to study from her        Of course I love her,enfp
ENTJ sister   We actually get along very well  except when she is manipulative sometimes and pretty srubborn  but given that i am pretty srubborn too       She makes fun of my introversion but It is already a inside joke between us   She is very open about whan happen to her and make me open myself from time to time  I thought for a long time she was a Ne user because she was so so so imaginative when younger    But her Te is off the charts  and i think her Ni Ne  Inferior Fi also makes more sense than tert Fe   She has no Fe  She thrives in conflict with my parents  Indeed she CREATES the conflict just for fun  My Fe go AHHHHHHH when that happens   Her Se is also pretty good   We also have an ISTP brother  ENTJ and INFJ sister for him  He loves us and hates us at the same time ,enfp
i cant decide between ISFP and ISTP its killing me,enfp
annoying selfish and she only care about her love interst hm well shes a prank queen and idk we fight everyday and night  still i love her but shhh dont tell her ,enfp
ENTP and INFJ sisters  you can already guess that we argue a lot ,enfp
                ENFP   si      ,enfp
Why is she typed as a       She does have some traits from enneagram   so I definitely see her having it in her tritype  but still  I think she fits the enneagram   way better  Her childhood trauma comes from her loneliness and craving for love that she lacked from her parents   s look for being loved and fear being unwanted  she clearly demonstrated this throughout the show  She dated Kaji soly because she was lonely and felt unloved  yet it scared her that she saw so much of her father in Kaji and therefore left him because her father never showed her love  I don t see her a sx  ,enfp
ppl will see an enxp and automatically vote them as a     ,enfp
why is she typed as E    Such an obvious sx ,enfp
If more people realised that   is a pleasure seeking  hedonistic type like   there would be less of these kind of mistypes  Misato uses pleasure to substitute her need for love hence why she s a   ,enfp
can someone explain ennegram  w    ,enfp
PDB tore her up    sx  how,enfp
Obvious Se user  Grounded in her physical environment  allowing her to quickly react to current circumstances and draw conclusions  This is what allows her to execute such risky plans such as on the UN ships  Inf Ni is visible  vis a vis her impulsivity  and the brutal truth is that it s self destructive  This girl is ruinous lol ,enfp
i m so confused how she s voted as ne over se  where is her ne at all  classic case of intuitive bias   as for sx   i saw a tiktok explaining why they think misato is an sx   so i ll summarize that tiktok  basically she wants love  but she doesn t know how to obtain love so she uses her body  hence her relationship with kaji  ,enfp
It seems like she s either an ENFP  w  or ESFP  w  but I can t tell anymore,enfp
Uhhh Any arguments for Ne dom ,enfp
It was expectable  that some people are going to vote for ESFP and  w  because she likes sex  alcohol and fighting  not even thinking that fighting is her job  and sex and alcohol are liked by a lot of people in the world because it s popular way to deal with problems    Anyway  I think that Misato is ENFP  w  sx so    s motivation fits her better than   s  her character is not about avoiding pain and boredom as much it is about fear to be unwanted and rejected  Misato has always wanted her father s validation  and she s still seeking it by seeing him in Kaji  She also tries to help Shinji a lot  I guess she could even have the rescuer syndrome  but I m not going to approve  Sx w  makes even more sense with her charming  seductive nature  Loving sex is not only   s trait  but sx   s either   because that s how they make up for a lack of love    I also don t understand why people do not see Ne in her  I mean  she was so obvious Ne dom to me for all the time  I couldn t even think that somebody is able to disagree  Throughthout series Misato shows an incredibale ability to find an escape from any situation  no matter how hard it is  Yes  sometimes her ideas are reckless and suicidal  but they work  so Nerv was able to defeat Angels again and again ,enfp
on board with core   or at the last so    but why are people voting wing    this is a genuine question and not a argument but I think that its a lot more fitting for Misato to be wing    she deep down places a huge emphasis on being  good  because being good and perfect means that her father can forgive and accept her  this response is all out of anger  for her father which makes even more sense because   is from anger repression triad ,enfp
i love this ENFP ESFP war,enfp
aw hell nah not another ENFP ESFP debate first naruto now her what s next  ESTP and ISFJ  nah g i m done,enfp
I m like      sure this woman bleeds Se  If the amount of times that we saw her drowning herself in sensory activities like sex  fighting and drinking like it was a  day to day thing to her and how much action oriented with little to none long term planning involved and at times even reckless she was when commanding battles doesn t convice you  i don t no what will  I m scrolling down for minutes here and didn t find a single argument about her Ne ,enfp
her consistently striving for love and acceptance to fill her void of feeling unwanted as well as avoiding all her problems as they keep piling up omg she s actually just like me  that s a  w  if i ever saw one ,enfp
whereas I can see where the  w  votes are coming from  I see misato a lot more of a  w     As for the  w  votes  again I can understand where it came from  as unhealthy  s are known to sometimes indulge in unhealthy coping mechanisms to distract from pain  as seen in how she drinks a lot and slept with kaji a lot when her motivation for the relationship in the first place was pretty unhealthy  as he reminded her of her father    However  I think she displays a lot more  w  traits as in she slept with kaji as less of a way to distract her from her pain  but as a way to seek the validation she desired from her father  A two s basic fear is to be unwanted unworthy  and even though she hated her father  she still sees him in people and seeks that validation from him even though she felt like he abandoned her  Her fear of feeling unwanted from a man is quite  w ish idk man   a sexual   especially makes sense for her  as they re typically very charming and passionate people  but under that have an underlying fear of desirability  If this doesn t scream misato I don t know what does LOL   anywho moral of the story i think misato is a  w   I still haven t picked a side on the ENFP vs ESFP argument yet so I m going to stick with ENFP for now but it s subject to change,enfp
Hi  English doesn t have my first language so I hope you understand what I mean  I hate to compare characters to people or characters to other characters when it comes to mbti  but my mom is an ESFP and looks a lot like Misato  Misato is focused in the present moment on the famous  here and now  so why not SE dominant  can you give me arguments about ENFP and ESFP  thank you so much and have a great day ,enfp
I m unsure about her four letter type  but she is NOT a  w   she is a  w    The  w  enneagram type is evident in her when we look at her childhood and how it affected her future relationships   SPOILERS AHEAD   w  s tend to be   Ambitious   Passionate about serving others   Overly optimistic  I think Misato shares all of the traits of a  w   but she expresses them in a very unhealthy way    because Misato is a very unhealthy person  mentally    Since the traits of a  w  present themselves in an unhealthy manner in Misato  Let s shift our focus to the fears of a  w   which have clearly manifested in Misato s character   The greatest fear of a  w  is being unwanted  unloved  and worthless  They become attached to people  most often one person  to drown out this fear    So    How are do these fears present themselves in Misato   Her Father   Kaji   We can see her trying to muffle her fear as a  w  with her relationship with Kaji  She used Kaji as a way to fill that half empty paternal void that was left after her dad passed away    When she was a child  she felt abandoned by her father  as he was too busy with his research with SEELE to show any attention to her and her mother  Her father really did care about her  which is why he brought her to the SEELE lab in Antarctica to show her why he was away all the time  However  the second impact occurred at the same time she was visiting him  resulting in him sacrificing the last bit of life he had left in his body to put Misato in the rescue pod  thus dying in the process    This event resulted in the young Misato being heavily traumatized  she was a selective mute for a year after this   Additionally  this made Misato  resent  her father even more    she interpreted him saving her as abandonment also  since why would he save her over himself  So as she grew older  she convinced herself that she hated her father when in reality  she was consumed by her grief over this event and used that  hate  as a coping mechanism    Moving onto what this means for her enneagram  For the first half of her life  she was already experiencing the basic fears of a  w   which ultimately led her to develop an unhealthy coping mechanism to save her from this fear  So enter Kaji  a man she states reminded her of her father  She essentially used him as a way to fill that void that was left after her father died    Her relationship with Kaji  for a short while  brought out the best in her  She found someone that made her feel loved and gave her the love that her father was never able to give her  This relationship relieved her fear of being unloved  BUT this relationship also led to her repressing and recognizing what her true intentions were in this relationship       Overall    TL DR    w  is Misato s enneagram  Looking at her relationships  her fear of being unwanted by a male figure  and how she drowns out these negative qualities through her work   beer   and her attempt to be Shinji s guardian    I have another argument for  w   and how we can also see it when she s in the workplace at NERVE  but this argument is already way too long  so I ll possibly post it in the future    Thanks for listening to my TEDTalk ,enfp
por ahora digo que es ESFP  me suena m s a que sea ENFP  estuve viendo reci n el anime y pues vi antes de empezarlo que la tipiaron como ENFP  Ahora voy en el cap tulo    y al contar la experiencia y raz n que tiene por estar en la agencia  bien se puede ver su Ni inferior  Muy aparte que tambi n Shinji mencion  que ella jubada a la loter a y no ganaba que tiene que ver en la intuici n  ido SUFOHSROHSHF  Ya el punto  cuando cont  lo que sent a hacia su padre y tal  Ella dijo que odiaba a su padre por ser dedicado y verlo como un so ador  Que ella y su madre le daban la imagen de la realidad a su padre  No es algo de un Ne dom  Y volviendo a lo de su raz n por la que est  en la agencia  Si bien los Se dom no est n acostumbrados a usar Ni  lo que siempre va a estar presente en ellos es que van a realizar una actividad o algo con alguna raz n o finalidad  donde estar an usando su Ni  es el que busca su motivo o raz n de existencia  cosas por el estilo   ya me convenc  m s en que es un Se dom JAKJBFKJABFBDK,enfp
can someone tell me how she is Ni inf   Edit   doing this coz character limit FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK,enfp
Just finished the show again and I have to say  seeing Misato voted  w  and not Kaji feels like a criminal offence  sx  w  should really be the last thing she should be typed as considering her storyline and issues with her father and Kaji by extension  It s entirely contradictory to her character  It can be seen from Misato s descriptions that her father was likely a sexual  w  Ne dom  most likely ENTP     She describes him as a man who  lived in his dreams  and was entirely consumed by his research work eventually coming to completely neglect his responsibilities as a husband and a father  She rejects the notion that people commonly had of him as a  sensitive  man and says he was a child like person who couldn t stomach reality and ran away from it  She doesn t seem to sympathise or relate with sublimation  dreaming  as a defence mechanisms which wouldn t be the case if she was a     Misato directs her unresolved feeling about her father towards Kaji  a self preservation  w  ENTP    In Kaji  I d found my father reborn  And so I fled from him  I was so afraid  He was so much like my father  But at the same time  I was also very happy  I was never happier  That was such a wonderful time    That s why I hated it  That s why I left     That s why I ran away  ,enfp
arguements for  w  and  w  please  I m like really not sure,enfp
the way we share four letter type  tritype and enneagram is scary,enfp
How Misato is an  w  sexual  the most less terrenal and celestial of the  s  practically people who tend to avoid his pain recurring to fantasy  where she does this  even Misato herself says this about his own father in the episode       A man who lived in his dreams  I couldn t stand him for that  I hated him even  He never paid attention to his own family  Everyone said he was a sensitive man  But he was really just a spineless man who couldn t stomach the reality    S  E    ,enfp
Would anyone mind explaining why SEE  I am open to arguments I just don t see Se base  EP temperament  or gamma quadra ,enfp
The dispute for   core for me would be  I didn t see the tendency of Ego Flattery and Gluttony seems to be more obvious if anything  I didn t see the act of that  give to take  as Naranjo said or rather that the gift caretaker tendency either  SX   is pretty much the most lovey dovey subtype and I really don t think it is that applicable for Misato  and as for the Deceit  should understand that the Ego go is about performing of what they are capable in doing to show themselves hence adding the structure of vanity according to their own direction  I think her attractiveness is rather stemmed on being an SX       if anything  hence then  I noticed her suggestibility with   seems to fit so far  although  I don t think this would convince you at all but I believe she fits the pursuit of success in being a risk taker that fits   and   assertive triad rather than the rejection as you previously said   a   The ability to do things expeditiously and with precision is characteristic of these individuals and makes for both good secretaries and good executives  In the service of efficiency thinking tends to be precise and there is often a leaning towards mathematics  A fast tempo is also characteristic and has probably developed in the service of efficiency as well as out of a desire to stand out through special efficiency  Also in the service of efficiency is an orientation to life that is both rational and practical an orientation often seen in the personality of those who take up engineering as a profession  Though there is interest in science  the peculiar bias of the character would be best described as scientism that is to say  a tendency to undervalue thinking that is not logico deductive and scientific  Along with this  one usually sees a high valuation of technology  and the broader trait of being systematic and skilled in organizing one s activities or those of others    b   Also related to the high achievement drive is a measure of ruthlessness in human interactions when it comes to a choice between success and considerateness  Ennea type III individuals are not only pleasers  but frequently described as cool  i e   a  cold cookie   and calculating  and they use others as well as themselves as stepping stones to their goals    c   Closely related to the pursuit of success are also the traits of control over self as well as over others  and dominance  These are typically observed in parents in their behavior toward their children  whom they may overpower through unsought advice and the insistence on having things done their way  even in the case of choices that would be more fitting for the children to make on their own     Sexual     The Lover  seduction or aggression   Highly focused on others   tend to produce a reaction  positive or negative  Determined to win over the person  targeted  by whatever means  Can be aggressive  but often want the chase more than catch  can fear real intimacy  Can also shape shift  losing themselves in the other  With growth  may try to hold back  thus alternating between approaching   retreating   Hmmm  I didn t see her  targeting  someone  doesn t work   Sexual     Movie Star  masculinity femininity   Focus on success via personal  sexual  attractiveness  charisma  radiance  cheerfulness  Can  perform  for many or for just one partner  Seek approval in     relationships but afraid of rejection when someone  sees through the act   can easily lose themselves in their image   Probably works but eh  both   and   can  lose themselves in their image   But her high need of performing  crazy  things seems like it   Sexual     Adventurer  suggestibility   Charming  risk taking  adventurous  Experience overdone due to extreme expansiveness   mental fascination  imagination  Suggestibility comes from tendency to merge with others  plans  ideas  fantasies  can get carried away by fantasies of love or unwittingly inflict hurt as  dance away lovers   but find commitment difficult  Love of intense experiences can mean addiction  Flower children  roll   rollers   Probably her suggestibility with being in drunk seems like it but eh  that s just   in general ,enfp
Her Se is just too good to not be present in her stack at all    Argument time   her being Se dom makes sense for her place in the story s framework  action oriented person that works for nerv because she s good at coordinating battles etc  Plus in the beginning she kinda foils the inertia of Shinji and his unwillingness to engage with reality   Se Te assessing the environment in real time and coming up with a plan  taking immediate action based on the present info   which is different from Ne Te way of coming up with an idea nobody asked for and then  if you re lucky enough to not get distracted by the same Ne  brute forcing it into reality,enfp
parei pra pensar e ela realmente   uma   core por ter    anos  ja passou por muitas coisas  conseguiu melhorar a terci ria    assertiva mas ela perde muito tempo tentando ajudar os outros  acolheu o shinji e asuka nada melhor que uma   core pra ser uma figura materna pro shinji o   do tritipo   aparente,enfp
I think she uses Se  She s present and focused on what is happening in the moment  She doesn t have her head in the clouds and dislikes people who do  She doesn t do much by way of abstract ideas  Also  she kicks ass with a gun ,enfp
misato def seems like a two can somebody explain their argument for   ,enfp
It s appalling how she s typed as a   here    Not every E  person remembers a childhood as a happy  loved  and pampered princess or an adorable  favorite son  In some we hear a story of deprivation  and on occasion this surfaces after some therapeutic exploration  It is possible to bring the person to see how the time of becoming a little princess was preceded by one of emotional pain  In these cases it seems as if the child wanted to be specially reassured of mother s or father s love through being specially cared for  delighted in  and tolerated in her whims or bouts of crying         A transition from frustration to a self satisfied and self satisfying stance  and self image generally can be seen  among women  as a shift from the experience of relative rejection by the mother to the development of seductiveness in view of becoming father s favorite         Hearing E  histories I have noticed something akin to a breaking of the will that seeks compensation in willfulness  Frustration is transformed in the compulsive search for freedom that characterizes this character s intolerance for rules and boundaries  ,enfp
I m only on episode   but i can see that she s clearly a Ne dom  I think you guys are mistaking her Te for Se and thats why you mistype her as ESFP but her being ENFP is one of the few things im sure about till now  Ill come back later because i dont really know about her enneagram tritype,enfp
M           o          m                  m                  y             ,enfp
Why se dom  Can someone just explain ,enfp
ENFP voters arguments so far    She have ideas therefore Ne     Implying any other type can not have idea  What are the rest of the human population do you think be like  trees  Whom are empty of thoughts and ideas    She has a messy house therefore Si    Si as a function would more likely to keep the house clean out of their preference to routine and traditions  Se would just be  meh  and go with the mess     She s supposed to be Sailor Moon    So you re typing a character  base on ANOTHER entirely different character from a different show     This is my second post on this thread and It s MIND NUMBLING to see ENFP still leading in vote with horrible logic and doing mental gymnastic to fit their view in every way possible  with the most obvious Se dom character to ever exist  so much so I d call her classic  matured  ESFP poster child   If you ask me what s a ESFP character I can name right now I could come up with      certainty  Misato and Power from CSM   Incredibly intuitive biased  ENFP voters  what a shame that reeks of dishonesty ,enfp
why does she have an   fix,enfp
hey guys can someone give me a good argument why ne se or why se ne   thanks,enfp
if you want an explanation for enneagram   just watch episode    lol,enfp
how is she a    i legit dont see it at all just because she likes to party does not instantly make her a  ,enfp

The difference between Se and Ne is big in cognition  but not as evident in behavior  Se doms and Ne doms are both spontaneous  adaptable  adventurous  ecc    ESFPs focus more on the concrete  existing world than the world of theories and abstractions    Vivid  accurate memory of facts and experiences   A yearning for adventure and excitement   Focus on the present moment   Resourceful nature   A spontaneous  flexible approach to life   A down to earth  grounded outlook on life   Ability to stay calm in crisis situations   Ability to act quickly and respond fast to incoming data      ENFPs prefer focusing on abstract possibilities and ideas rather than concrete data  They prefer imagining what could be rather than dwelling on what  is    Driving Force  To generate ideas  possibilities  and new ways of doing things  To explore theories  innovate  and create opportunities   Weaknesses  May be so focused on new ways of doing things that they  re invent the wheel  and struggle to create consistent routines  May be so focused on the big picture that they lose sight of the details     They are imaginative and open minded   They look for possibilities beyond the immediate situation   They see abstract connections between things that may seem random to others   They are curious and excited by variety   What do you think applies to her I m not sure because i don t remember her character very well  the only thing I can say is that I think her Fi is not well developed because she doesn t know how to set proper boundaries  She just takes short cuts for receiving love and validation  at the expense of her self respect  Te over Fi  It doesn t necessarily mean she s in a loop  Developing the aux function is not always easy  since its direction is opposite to the dominant function s ,enfp
We are never getting anywhere  ENFP voters say her hit the nail  present and steadfast work style is because of her Te  and ESFP voters also say her capacity of stacking one fact after the other to come up with a plan is because of her Te  But it would be really cool if ENFP voters could stop being presumptious and acting like the only Se dom argument presented was  she drinks beer on week days   Personally  I vote for ESFP because I see it as much easier to visualize Te tert being capable of infusioning Se dom with the capacity of formulating strategy based on data  than being capable of giving a Ne dom almost instant  on the spot decisiveness  plus  Ne doms are known for being much more open minded in general and are much less judging of others emotions ways of acting even if they don t have Fe  whereas Se Fi s are much more  dat is not the wae   Power from CSM is a superb example   and Misato herself is very assumptive on her first impressions meeting Shinji  not to mention getting mad at the beggining of the anime because Shinji was disregarding his own life  trying to change it by direct questioning without trying to really see his perspective  we can also see how no one from her operation team ever tries to give her a suggestion  except Ritsuko who literally went to college with her so probably knows her way around better  mid action  and at last  the utmost demonstration of Se Fi Te is at the end of episode    where she  even though she cares a lot about Shinji  can t hold back and just says some heartbreaking truths about Kaworu s suicide  pratically trying to brute force Shinji out of his emotional breakdown   edit  plz don t downvote me without arguing  we re all here to learn and I m not leaning towards ESFP because I have something against ENFPs,enfp
ESFP because she likes beer and we know only Se doms can drink and get drunk  edit  the downvote must be fun at parties,enfp
I love how she s typed ENFP because  she has plans  when basically all of her plans are straightforward as      and she s completely action focused  ignoring even straight up supercomputer calculated chances of everything going to       Ne Doms are simply too deviating to have such consistent composure and eagerness in such an stressful real time teamwork coordination setting  even if they re backed up by Fi as their second function  Episode     Misato goes inside an out of control nuclear powered  EVA  to try and stop  which wasn t her responsability btw   only to find out the password given to her doesn t work  now if you tell me it s completely normal for an NE DOMINANT to not lose his      even slightly after such a thing  I m going to think that you might be biased   Oh but she breaks rules  which can totally be attributed to simply Fi  not to mention it puts her position in risk even more than once  a clear indicative of low Ni  being uncapable of holding onto personal interests when making important decisions   edit  I m sorry for swearing so much I m not a native speaker so I might have a hard time expressing intensity without using harsh words lmao,enfp
i will NEVER forgive yall for mistyping her as a    IM GONNA CRY DUDE,enfp
Definetly a  w   I could see maybe a   being in her tritype but she s an obvious   core  Her entire character is that she relys on the attention and affection of men and has a need to feel loved to feel good about her self    Part      vs      Alot of traits people list as why she s a   are also common traits found among   s  She pushes away any sad feelings which is probably why people think she s a   but this is also a very common trait in   s they tend to repress any negative emotions hoping others will aid them  and excessively express positive emotions to hide feelings of unwantedness  Like   s misato ignores her sadness with escapism   cheap thrills  but she does so by getting with men  She needs to be needed  unlike sevens who dont want to be tied down  The difference is like type   s misato has an underlying need to help others  We can see this in episode    where she talks about her childhood  her father was always away so she had this constant need to help her mother anyway she can  She also tries to help shinji various times  In this episode she also talks about needing to be  a good girl so daddy doesent hate me   She hates her father but still craves love and validation from him  This is why she gets with kaji  she craves love and validation from him that her father never gave to her  We also learn she can t stand being alone  she needs someone to wake up to  lie in bed with her  she craves intimacy  unlike   s   Part    SX subtype   SX   s often justify their actions behind  love  which they view as seduction and attraction and this can be seen in episode    where when confronted she claims she slept with kaji bc  she loved him  despite admiting she slept with him because he reminded her of her father and that she was tired of being seen as clean  She also kisses shinji in the end of evangelion because she sees this as a way to motivate him in the only way she knows how  Besides this she also just tends to use her charm to influence others and enjoys the attention presenting herself sexually gives her ,enfp
where s the ne in her  i see her more as an ESFP cuz she switches to a much more practical and observant persona whenever she s on her job  and she follows the rules usually instead of coming up with new ideas ,enfp
why core    i think sx   makes a lot more sense,enfp
Lol she ESFP because she drinks and does physical things  You guys should meet more ENFP s irl lol,enfp
marry me misato ilysm AAAAAAAAA,enfp
Why SEE over ESE   I want a counter argument because SEE isn t fitting well at all,enfp
also  i ve gotta ask  why enneagram   core ,enfp
the main argument for Se is that shes  observant of her environment  ok and  many types fall into that category  im an ENFP and ive been told by friends that im very perceptive and observant  more so even than my se user friend  stop typing based purely on stereotypes ,enfp
I know that there were good arguments that she can be a ESFP  but still  ENFP character   exist  Some people  It s obviously ESFP cuz he she is so FuNnY and cute   ,enfp
i was watching the rebuilds last night and her ne and te are so developed  tell me how she seeks out these exciting experiences  she s perfectly social and indulges in plenty of things  but these are obvious coping mechanism more than anything else  not indicative of se  misato is quick on her feet and easily comes up with new ideas to defeat the evas  she s an idealist  she sees these possibilities and is willing to take the risks to do what needs to be done  very evident in the rebuilds and how she directs the pilots to fight the angels  she is so typical of a ne in leadership  always coming up with novel and very out in left field ideas  and because of her developed te  she succeeds again and again  as for her fi  you can see this as the main motivator for her fight against the angels  she is motivated by the horror she saw in the second impact  and she consistently brings herself back to that in order to keep herself motivated  i think this is why she s able to empathize and guide shinji as well as she does  using her fi and her incredibly developed te  she guides shinji back to the eva and back to the fight  she shares her own beliefs and her own experiences in order to help shinji check back in with his own  just because she indulges in worldly things doesn t mean that she s a se dom ,enfp
Why is ExTP not considered  People are saying her Te is evident because she knows how to act serious in job  while forgetting that cognitive functions explains our thought process  not behavior   Te isn t about being a proper worker  it s about making judgments based on objectively perceptible fact  While Ti is making judgments based on logical principle which  though not present in the external facts  is the most abstract  theoretical expression of the external facts  Actually what we re wrong about is  Misato s Ti is getting confused with Ne  Yeah she s creative with her plans  that isn t something only high Ne users can do  and she really relies on them because it makes sense to her own logic  it s an inner thinking process rather than external  that s why her co workers seem to miss how she has trust in them  Most times we re given the information of probability for the plan to work  calculated by supercomputers  and most of time these probabilities are too low  A Te user would rely more on these mathematical information   objective fact  that they wouldn t insist to continue the plan that has         possibility of working   Even ENFP voters admitted that her Fi isn t visible  thus there are Ne Te loop arguments  Misato said that she had hard time identifying her desire to kill angels  that she doesn t know if it s to get revenge of her father or not  Introverted Feeling is making judgments with your own moral code  to do that you have to be aware of your own feelings  she lacks that   In another episode Aida tells Shinji that he s lucky because he can see the real Misato that outsiders like himself can t  Fe users make judgments based on external morals  this makes them hide their own self at times  Fi users tend to reflect their pure self to other people more  She built the harmony between the three Eva pilots  And she is the only one who could see Shinji wasn t actually happy despite riding the Eva without complaints  At least there s a visible Fe   Now that i explained that her proclaimed Ne is actually Ti  i m leaning on the ESTP side  But i won t vote her MBTI because i want to see the counter arguments this one will get first    English isn t my first language and I m pretty sure these paragraphs have a ton of grammar mistakes so please bear with me  ,enfp
a big thing about misato s character is that she doens t know how to show affection or care for someone without doing it physically  which indicates se ne imo,enfp
i get why some would vote ESFP  however i think her Ne is more prominent than her use of Se  e g  plans on defeating angels  yes she is quick on her feet and grounded  but her decisions are mostly theoretical and she believes strongly in them  both Ne and Se users seek experience and engagement in the outside world  so she can almost be seen as one than the other ,enfp
You know what  People keep calling out Intuitive bias for her because she has developed Te     and that is a Sensor stereotype if I ve ever seen one  ENFPs are extremely capable of keeping it cool on a very rigorous day jobs  and I can actually appreciate this one representation of one because it implies ENFPs can function in highly rigorous  corporate environments  I guessed she was some kind of Ne dom  but once I saw the the Te I realized this was an ENFP  Y all  We re not constantly trying to go wild and rogue and join communes  We can be      assholes in corporate gigs  We re really good at it  We can also go home  crank open them beers and be as ditzy as we want  This is the only fictional character I ve seen who s shown both sides  Glad to claim her as one of our own ,enfp
i am back  i m rewatching the rebuilds so i can get prepared for            misato s intuition for plans to defeat the angels is a recurring topic in the series  she constantly uses her gut feelings and the most absurd ideas  she even said it herself   a woman s intuition   an se user would try to create more realistic ideas and plans that without a doubt would work ,enfp
even i  an ESFP myself  an expert on se  who hates intuitive bias can say she s an ENFP  y all are mistaking her te for se ,enfp
HER ENNEAGRAM IS SO OBVIOUS AND THE WAY THAT YOU GUYS JUST TYPED HER BASED ON STEREOTYPES  DID YOU WATCH THE SHOW   ,enfp
Guys  she s an ESFP  Not an ENFP  Not because she do a lot of sensory stuff  but because she is grounded  direct and reactive  Much more than an ENFP  When she elaborates strategy  she have an easier time noticing tangible elements that she can put in her plans  without second guessing their effectiveness  She knows precisely what she tries to escape her past  Inferior Ni   and never stay too long in nostalgia  She looks forward and value the present moment  do not like to seem miserable to others  but rather strong and confident  because she knows her reactive abilities,enfp
intuitive bias having trauma doesn t equal inferior Si also how can an ENFP be SEE,enfp
 So fu    what if I m not you   That doesn t mean it s okay for you to give up  If you do  I ll never forgive you as long as I live  God knows I m not perfect either  I ve made tons of stupid mistakes and later I regretted them  And I ve done it over and over again  thousands of times  A cycle of hollow joy and vicious self hatred  But even so  every time I learned something about myself     The one who deserves to survive is the one who has the will to make it happen  He wished for death  He ignored his will to survive and chose to die for a false hope  Your survival is not a mistake  Shinji     Why Shinji  Exactly why did you come here  You mustn t run away  You must confront your father  and you must confront yourself      Giving up halfway is worse than never trying at al l come on  Get up  MOVE IT      A man who lived in his dreams  I couldn t stand him for that  I hated him even  He never paid attention to his own family  Everyone said he was a sensitive man  But he was really just a spineless man who couldn t stomach reality     Sometimes you just need some wishful thinking to keep on living     Were you really in love with him     Yes thats right  He accepted me for who I am    He was gentle with me    It makes me feel happy to be desired     So sleeping by yourself makes you feel lonely  You can t stand the hole in your heart  That s why you dont care who its with     I m a conniving       who only asks men for help when it s convenient for her  even back then maybe I was just using you       Even though a hedgehog may want to become close with another hedgehog  The closer they get the more they injure each other with their spines    I have a hard time understanding the ENFP sx  votes  i haven t seen a single argument explaining why misato uses ne or se  just excuses to vote one or another  Mbti is an inconsistent typology system but in my opinion misato is a clear ESFP SEE sx  being sx  a ridiculous and completely stereotypical typing for a character like misato   Misato shows a clear focus on the concrete world  to make things happen on the here and now  she s not focused on the multiple possibilities of the world or the situation  she s a determined character who is not only able to mobilize herself with her willpower but also others  shinji  she never gives up and encourages shinji to not do it either  recurring to harsh communication to explain her point  without mentioning her overindulgence tendencies in sensory things  in the past quotes you can figure out her motivations and that she openly feels HATRED towards his dad   living in his dreams   which is basically one of the main things that characterizes Sx s in the first place  Misato herself has difficulty reaching out to people without the use of sexuality  she has a need for love and need to seduce others with her charm and body  if I m not completely wrong in the series of    episodes specifically in ep   she mentioned how all the men she has dated before are similar to his father which she hates and neglects so much for not giving their family the love and attention that was required  is not really hard to make the connection  misato dated people similar to her father in order to receive that love and affection that she lacked most of her life  does she even loved this people  She admitted how she used them to her convenience and all of this just perfectly reflects the fears and motivations of E s   The sexual   is one of the most seductive characters  they seek affection and recognition trough their kindness  promises  charm and beauty   The need to seduce the sx E  implies a need for the desire of the other  But to say that the desire is only sexual would be to see only the most apparent  By investigating the matter by asking such people what they want  more original responses can be received  such as   I want everything   Just as we think of Helen of Troy as an archetype of the woman for whom a war is waged and for whom men are willing to lose their lives  we can say that sexual E  aspire to an irresistibility that can inspire women  greatest passions  Only most of these people are not quite honest enough to say   what I really want in man is for him to be a pocket Samson   or  I want a giant who will give me everything I want and when I want it    It is understood that there are people who think that inspiring great passion can be a way to solve everything in life  and that sexuality can involve money  castles and essentially blank checks  this is how the sexual two thinks   The sexual seven is not earthly  but heavenly  Hes not interested in the things of this world  It is the gluttony of the things of a higher and more advanced world  The sx E  is what we might call a dreamer  Ichazo used the word suggestive  which I understand as the passion to imagine something be better than the bleak reality  It is the passion to enchant reality  to fantasize  to paint things pink  It s a form of idealization,enfp
I see both Se and Ne in her but I think she s just a character with really high Ne rather than being a Ne dom,enfp
She uses Se in socionics and Ne in MBTI,enfp
Care to explain why Misato is ESFP  And I am not open to explanations that talk about behaviour and personality  you won t convince me that way  Same goes for people who think Misato is ENFP  I want to see both sides  I am not saying that I disagree with one or the other ,enfp
Shes a ESFP not answering any questions ,enfp
Not      obvious SEE creative subtype  the rest is pure math   stronk,enfp
Wasn t her whole shtick that she was reactive to the moment  And being especially observant of the environment  Not seeing a lot of Ne in there ,enfp
through the whole series she was trying to find out the truth non stop  she was so overly curious  no way shes a N over I,enfp
 ENFPs take a warm  genuine interest in others  they can  read  people well  and will act as the catalyst for new initiatives and creative ways of solving problems  They will bring a radical perspective to the team   this is textbook misato definition lol,enfp
Wait    Ne dom and SLUAN  Instead of SLUAI ,enfp
Why people think she is a feeling type  She s strategic and rational  rational enough to act charismatic when she needs to  The way she deals with Shinji to make him believe in himself and do what he gotta do is a big proof that she s more Fe than Fi    And why  w   She s a badass commander of the world s most important mission  but because she s goofy when alone she is a      Misato is a character that should not be stereotyped ,enfp
I rlly do see both se and ne but I m leaning more towards se  shes able to think on the spot and constantly falls back on sensory experience  ENFP voters please tell me what you think because I m still not sure   ,enfp
An ENFP that is not a complete idiot  has sex  drinks and takes action when needed  Oh  must be an ESFP,enfp
I don t really understand the abundance of SEE votes  Misato shows the ability to exert authority but only insofar as her position at NERV demands it  Se doesn t seem to be her main way of perceiving the world   However  she is very capable of generating ideas and measuring their potential  coming up with a plan on the spot  Ne   shows great strategic thinking  acts professionally in accordance to her rank and to a certain extent respects Gendo s and Fuyutsuki s hierarchical authority  Ti   Meanwhile her lifestyle outside of work betrays her weak Si  As for Fi PoLR  Anno himself puts it best       lives life so lightly as to barely allow the possibility of human touch  She protects herself by keeping relationships on the surface  and by running away  ,enfp
ESFP and ENFP war aside  non open   Ne dom still makes zero sense,enfp
Yeah  ENFPs cannot drink beer and MUST be an artist or some kind of job that requires creativity,enfp
I think what confuses people and se dom voters is how fast Misato adapts and reacts  Well  that is ne dom too  And ne dom can be really good at something in the real world too  that s not se dom exclusive  I for example am an A  volleyball player  or would you think an ENFP would be on the field and be hit by the ball all the time bc they are unicorn sugarcotton airheads  Nah  That s a dumb stereotype  We react just as fast as se doms and master skills just as fast or react even faster since ne is such a fast thinking process ,enfp
i also just want to say that an Ne user can actually be    reactive    and like respond to a crisis in an adaptable way  they are not all like  uwu rainbows and ponies and lets travel to the moon guys yay       of the time  and working an adult job means that you are going to have to obviously adapt to the situation  and even then  her methods ARE unconventional  and she responds to them in an Ne way  her last moments arent giving shinji a realistic run down of what he needs to actually do in the situation like an Se user would  but instead a high and mighty inspirational speech  proceeding to weirdly kiss him and promise to sleep with him  wtf   what part of that is Se at all  she even constantly comes to clashes with ritsuko during the show  who has her inverse Si  she hasn t got any problem seeing more symbolic meanings  i mean look at her breakdown in the last episode  she immediately sees the connection between her father and kaji  and also spends the majority of the series reminding shinji of the bigger picture ,enfp
She seems to me quite ENFP  her plans are quite unreal and imaginative sometimes taken from the least thoughtful concepts  it is really annoying and annoying how people think that Ne users cannot take action at all  Misato acts based on Ne  Te their plans are imaginative but it has a Te strong enough to make it pragmatic and how can they deny their Yes inf  She has the same opposite dynamics with RItsuko  ISTJ  as INFP Shinji and ESTJ Asuka,enfp
If anyone can explain Inf Si I would gladly reconsider my vote because honestly one of her main roles in the series was being very reactive in the moment to severe emergencies and she often eventually puts a singular plan together to solve the problem at hand which definitely seems more like the Se Ni axis to me,enfp
misato is extremely quick on her feet and enjoys sensory pleasures but that doesn t make her an Se dom  i ve been so torn between Se vs  Ne but her plans are so out of the box and unlikely  i believe an Se dom would be more practical and base their plans on observable fact rather than what misato does which is essentially     seeing how unlikely something is to work and doing it anyways because her intuition tells her it will  i feel like a major source of this debate to begin with is the fact that she engages in sensory pleasures for relief but that s not exclusive to Se  and could honestly just be her inferior Si anyways i think  and yes  Se doms can use intuition too  but the  guiding factor  for most of her decisions is her intuition  i just can t see an ESFP relying on it as much as she does  i m still learning though  so if i m wrong about something constructive criticism is appreciated  ,enfp
Oh sure  ENFPs can t drink  having s x and having a trauma because that makes them Se users,enfp
im watching ep   as im typing this  i dont even get the ENFP votes lol  shes definitely a textbook ESFP  can someone explain how she s even ne se   ,enfp
I m leaning toward Ne  During the  th or  th episode  we were shown that she only pretended to look tough  using Te  in front of her coworkers due to Japanese workplace culture  She s quirky asf when she s with children and people with whom she has a personal relationship  Her unusual level of determination might have come from years of curating her professional persona in the military  She seems to use a lot of focus in order to be determined  edit  look determined  tough   which should come easy for an ESFP ,enfp
shes constantly falling back on sensory experiences in almost every case especially when shes stressed  like when she went up with kaji after freaking out abt her dad   shes always having to puting shinji back in his place after his head is in the clouds and pulling him back down to reality  se vs ne  ,enfp
tbh inferior Ni fits her pretty well  but so does inferior Si  after a lot of thinking I believe she s a Ne user  Se doms can be just as rash as her but their plans would be somewhat more realistic and down to earth ,enfp
ouch this is a tough one  but I will carefully leave an ENFP vote here    ESFP and ENFP are actually pretty similar and people may be confused over which type that suites her the most but she used Ne a lot more  as her Dom  as ENFP does which ESFP does not   an example on misato using Ne is when shinji ran off to leave town  misato went after him because she didn t want to feel the pain of loneliness once again as before   im afraid to say that i highly think that the ESFP voters possibly voted her as an Se Dom because of the stereotypes ,enfp
Maybe she acts like ESFP sometimes  but ENFP and ESFP can be a bit similar in some acts it s normal  But I see her Ne and I think that she is an ENFP ,enfp
I feel like people are only voting ESFP because she s an alcoholic  She DEFINITELY uses Ne  Take her in charge at Nerv  for example  She can strategically come up with new ideas and backup plans without hesitation  She can see other views if needed  And her Fi is accompanied with this  she can feel what is right and wrong when things turn out bad  Also Si inferior bro  She neglected her past and became a new person  only for it to come back and haunt her when she was unhealthy  She became more like herself from before during this time  and I can only see her as an ENFP ,enfp
 ne dom  non inquisitive  The math ain t mathing,enfp
First  why is Misato typed as a sx   Literally the whole reason she hated her dad is that he never paid attention to what was really happening and neglected his family    Season    Episode    when she was talking to Shinji about why she joined NERV    A man who lived in his dreams  I couldn t stand him for that  I hated him even  He never paid attention to his own family  Everyone said he was a sensitive man  But he was really just a spineless man who couldn t stomach reality    Sexual Sevens are dreamers with a need to imagine something better than stark  ordinary reality  These Sevens have a passion for embellishing everyday reality  for being too enthusiastic  and for idealizing things and seeing the world as better than it actually is  Their gluttony gets expressed as a need for idealization   How does this represent Misato in any way  She is practical and driven towards her ideas  not a person who avoids reality to supress negative emotions  I don t believe she is a    but if she were to be  sp  would make a lot more sense    Secondly  why has no one considered enneagram   for Misato  In episode     when she was walking home from the party with Kaji she comes to this realization that the men she dated were extremely similar to her father  She dated those men who were like her father BECAUSE of the lack of love she received from him  she hated him for that but also subconsciously projected that lack of love onto men that were like him   She uses relationships to get what she wants  as stated by Misato herself   I m a conniving b tch who only asks men for help when it s convenient for her  even back then maybe I was just using you     The Sexual Two s deeper need for love and need to seduce manifests in a character who uses beauty  charm  and promises of affection to attract a partner who will make them feel desirable and meet all their needs  This Two may need attention or money or pampering  but whatever it is  the strategy to obtain it centers around classical seduction designed to create a special connection through which the Two can have their needs and desires satisfied   MORE QUOTES   So sleeping by yourself makes you feel lonely  You can t stand the hole in your heart  That s why you dont care who its with     Were you really in love with him     Yes thats right  He accepted me for who I am    He was gentle with me     It makes me feel happy to be desired      You re saying I should take care of myself  huh     Misato talking to Kaji,enfp
A lot of people agree she s a   core  but there s some disagreement here about her wing either being a  cp or an    I d suggest rewatching episodes     her conversation with Kaji outside  and     her psycho analysis   She clearly latches on to things that give her a feeling of stability and security and fears the possibility of being wrong in her decisions  Whether it be her on off relationship with Kaji  who she seeks comfort in because of how she believes he resembles her deceased father   her resentment towards the angels  which leads her to become loyal to Nerv   or her subsequent conflicting feelings about Nerv and the Eva  skepticism stemming from uncertainty in the self   these are all traits very common in   s and   wings    s independence comes from a fear of being controlled and bossed around  but Misato s seems to come from a counter phobic compensation of her personal needs instead  All of the reasoning for her behavior explored in the later end of the series strikes me as  ish ,enfp
How does ESFP have more votes than INFP tho    Wth,enfp
there is no way his ne is strong enough to be his dominant function  ne in socionics for iee  that i can see  but ne is about natural temperament to creating webs of information  ne in socionics is about ideas and potential  which could be ne in mbti but ne is about so many other things   he s not ne dom  he doesn t act like an ENFP  he acts like an iee ,enfp
He has the same tritype and enneagram as Bubbles  They re both high Fi Ne users and are both very sweet  cheerful  playful  imaginative  loves animals  and easily makes friends ,enfp
having the same mbti  enneagram AND big   as aang is my biggest flex in life  ,enfp
aang tries his best to see all emotional possibilities  we can see the difference between his ne and zuko s se ni when they redirected lightning  zuko was already beyond the point of heartbreak and just shot it back at his father  in his mind  that was it  his father was a terrible man  this was his destiny  but for aang  it first took him weeks to try to decide on a way to deal with the fire lord  when he was redirecting lightning  he stopped halfway after seeing ozai s face  he could always see possibilities  another great example was during the final battle  he said  no  i m not going to end it like this   very very ENFP,enfp
A true ENFP  While firstly appearing only as an impulsive typical tv protagonist in a cartoon show there is sth very unique to his character that makes him stand out  Unlike most of these characters who basically stay the same save the day but never evolve Id say Son Goku is a good example for a character like that Aang instead matures and maybe because I as a child matured with him as well see it only because of this like that but the transformation he makes from the boy who fled from responsibility to a living legend is a timeless concept but often fails in our modern times as humanity seems to have given up on true heroism so we have now only anti  heroes  like Deadpool or even straight out villain protagonists because somehow creators arent brave enough for handling this anymore and instead cling to a grey morality crapsack world where there is no room for hope or heroism and maybe thats why Aang and this series are so outstanding in many ways ,enfp
Aang is without a doubt an ENFP  he is very empathetic  flighty  sorry for the pun   imaginative  and amazing at befriending people,enfp
He s either an so sx   or an so sp    he s not an so sx    Also  he doesn t strike me as insecure physics ,enfp
Can someone please explain so sx over so sp  I don t see Aang exhibiting much of a desire to  merge  with others the way an sx   would  Even when he s in love with Katara  he views them as two distinct individuals   Sp  s are very attached to routine and creature comforts  Aang doesn t seem to primarily do this  but I see more evidence of it  he doesn t always love change  though that could just be Si grip  than of sx ,enfp
His Te Si came out when he was freaking out the day before the solar eclipse lmao,enfp
it might actually be healthy to use non anime sources while typing it  there was a very good comment about this  but I can t find it  The use of the Ne function in the argument was well explained  I hope that comment hasn t been deleted ,enfp
ive been asking for several days now of certain ENFP voters to explain si inferior  but they keep evading the question  im here to actually discuss mello s type  so please explain si inferior  and don t give me any of that  well explain ni inf  bs  i am asking first  when i get a reply  i will respond  edit  LMAOAOA NOT YALL DOWNVOTING ME    I asked for a reply  what s wrong ab that  are y all that scared of ESFP voters   ,enfp
Still think hes too intense and emotionally volatile to actually be an ENFP  Sigh this site is mistyping again,enfp
can someone pls explain the   fix ,enfp
im so confused cause im looking everywhere for actual explanations for ne dom but like   where lmao  i cant find a single one explaining why tf he actually uses Ne   news flash  he doesnt  mello is in no way a ne dom  in fact i would go to say he LACKS ne  he never looks for different possibilities or takes one idea and goes into different directions from that point  if you did say so  if you did say he did do this  give an example  a line  a quote  yeah  sure  hes in his head like ppl say  but you realize se users can   think   too   im currently in the middle of rewatching death note and will post an argument for ESFP then  one way i can see it and put it into words without quotes is  how si inferior  mello doesnt struggle with si at all  sefiteni makes more sense in many ways  especially with the fact that mello does not like to simply speculate and imagine possibilities  which would normally satisfy a ne dom  the pure thought is enough in most cases  but se doms are actually the ones who vigilantly carry out things  without forseeing the real consequences in cases  inf ni   they are more realistic too  and try to only pay attention and spend time on ideas that actually feel like could be plausible to carry out  this is definitely a lot more mello   mellos character revolves around envy as well  a key  w  characteristic  either way  ENFP and ESFP voters can mostly agree on this yes  he is ambitous and driven  but not because of his self image but purely out of envy and personal desires ,enfp
there s no way he is a Ne dom like idk ,enfp
mello seems way more like a sx  w  to me    here s some of the description of sx     according to beatrice chestnut    In the Sexual Four subtype  the inner motivation is envy  and its manifestation as competition  These Fours don t feel consciously envious so much as they feel competitive as a way of muting the pain associated with envy  If they can compete against another person they perceive as having more than they do and win  they can feel better about themselves  Sexual Fours believe it s good to be the best  Most people want to present a good image to others  but Sexual Fours don t care very much about image management or being liked  For them  it s better to be superior  They are highly competitive  and their intense focus on competition takes the form of actively striving to show that they are the best    doesn t that sound exactly like mello   he is not image based at all  he cares abt winning and showing that he is better than near ,enfp
the whole arc of his character is that he is SO emotionally driven and lacks a logical perspective ,enfp
Okay someone who believes he is a  w  what is your response to  The  w  personality is likely to be always putting on a show for other people around  trying to grasp attention or making things happen for them  and they tend to be more externally motivated than the  w   who may pay more attention to their inner world and try to do things that fit into this world instead of dealing with the outside The  w  is also much more ambitious than the  w   but this does not mean that they are in any way malicious  manipulative  narcisssist  or boisterous  it just means that they like to put on the mask of who they really are or how they feel  while the  w  may be more open and honest because they may be too concerned about their unique sense of identity to bother with any masks  ,enfp
He is one of the most type   i had ever seen  but why Ne   Se   Not disagreeing  just curious,enfp
Hot take but maybe he s an sx so with just a strong so variant  Sx is a lot about intensity of feelings  which I would attribute to him a bit more than the typical so traits  Which he still shows of course  he s definitely not so blind  but I d actually put his sx higher than so and he also kind of fits an sx  better than an so    Also who tf is voting      I d love to hear your reasoning for him not having a   fix  Not seeing a   fix above a   I get  even tho I see it differently  but his   fix is pretty obvious ,enfp
El es un muy obvio   social type   ,enfp
could someone elaborate on social      i m having trouble w  his subtype,enfp
how is he so   if you read about iv and enneagram together he fits the description of sx  much more,enfp
tritype       WHAT  He have a Love abandonment issues and he literally fells bad when Langa don t talk to him      explain why ,enfp
T o facil amo ele Renga canon,enfp
are the ESFP votes from people who watched only the first episode and then fuckjin  left  ,enfp
He definitely is one of the most ENFP  w  that exist in anime haha  at first sight i thought he would be an ENFP  or ESFP   with a visible  ,enfp
his  fix was so evident during his fight with langa  why would you think he s          where does he have any   ,enfp
Even tho his fi was very prominent in nwh  many movies that he was in showed his Ne  I think the movie was a situation where he just put more emphasis on fi whereas his ne comes more naturally ,enfp
No way home really cements it  It took May and his friends to really convince him to follow what he stands for  His Fi is secondary to his Ne  He tends to respond without thinking things too far ahead and comes up with all possible ways to counter something  like constantly adding clauses when the spell was being cast and pretty much interrupting it  The way he tries all kinds of tactics on the fly to escape Strange  even the genius problem solving Ne Te moment with geometry  By contrast Tobey still felt a lot more grounded INFP overall than Tom s version  so did Andrew s  but to provide an argument for that  it might be due to experience  Still  standing with the ENFP typing for now  Maybe as the new trilogy commences we will see a lot more of his aux function develop  since ENFPs really develop Fi from their late teens to most of their twenties ,enfp
After No Way Home  I think INFP could be a possibility  Most of his decisions in the movie were based of his Fi  Maybe even in future movies he will use even more Fi and then for sure be an INFP  but right now I don t think that s the case  Yes  he used lots of Fi  but he also uses lots of Ne  This could be either an INFP with strong Ne or an ENFP with strong Fi  In NWH I could definitely see him as an INFP with strong Ne  but in Homecoming and FFR I couldn t say the same  Just because he acted more like an INFP in one movie  doesn t mean that we can get rid of the fact he acted more like an ENFP in other movies  Through all the times we have seen him  his actions reflected more the functions of an ENFP than an INFP  If his character starts consistently acting like INFP in future movies  then I could see his type changing  but right now I think it should stay ENFP ,enfp
yeah after his depression in no way home he became way more introverted,enfp
MCU Peter is a    Ideation is a big driver for him at the start  he wants to be an Avenger because the Avengers are awesome  wants to impress Ironman because Ironman is awesome  The   desire for belonging is there but it s not the core drive    Peter is driven by a need to avoid pain  which extends to his friends  since he suffers when they suffer on his behalf   Movie     he wants to escape his grief for Tony Stark by having an amazing time abroad with his friends  Movie     he wants to escape the stress of his identity reveal by having an amazing time at MIT with his friends   In both movies he hits a low point where he wants to run from grief  He s tempted to quit and shirk responsibility when things get too emotionally difficult  and must power through his pain to save the day  By the end of the trilogy  Peter has grown to find satisfaction in sacrificing his own happiness for others  healthy      He s Spider Man out of a sense of social obligation   When you can do the things that I can  but you don t  and then the bad things happen  They happen because of you   That s an so  ,enfp
Just saw No Way Home and it was fantastic so I thought I d do an analysis here for Mbti   Spoilers From Civil war  No Way Home       you have been warned      After seeing this movie  I d argue MCU Peter as INFP with the intense amount of Fi he used but it could be a secondary in pressure  It honestly goes either way for Holland s Spidey as ENFP or INFP but Im leaning towards INFP for a few reasons   A  In Homecoming and Civil War he displayed more Fi of wanting to prove himself as an avenger and being spiderman  B  INFP s can be social as ENFP s can be private with an example being Callum  a social INFP  from Dragon Prince and Steven from Steven Universe   C  Peter s main problems are typically idealizing someone or being too trusting  Tony and Mysterio  with his past experiences of failure looping with Fi Si  He also wants things to be normal  feel that s the main focus of all movies  Homecoming is about being a better hero while having a normal prom  FFH is not being a hero and NWH is realizing he cant have both a heroic and normal life   I do see Holland s pete having ENFP moments  Scatterbrained in NWH  and sort of hyperactive energy  but as an INFP I have fel that sort of thing when excited or interested in a topic  Towards the end of Nwh and past experiances  Peter becomes more action oriented and chooses to be logical  Te grip   Peter has shown this when making his new suit in FFH and making his own webbing but that s pretty much it for actions of logic  Te   which feels more inferior with Holland s peter than tertiary   I haven t seen far from home but Ive watched some clips and the way Mysterio manipulates Peter is through playing a perfect hero and stoking feelings of inadequacy and Tony s death   Fi   The comments will be probably ugly below but I want to discuss this because I like Spiderman and I can relate to Holland more especially after this movie ,enfp
CAN WE STOP TYPING ALL ENFP s WITH STRONG FI AS INFP s   I think I speak for all ENFP s when I say that our Fi  in stressful or confrontational situations  comes out stronger than our Ne  I was mistyped as an INFP when I first got into MBTI just because I m an ambivert and in touch with my feelings  Go watch the first two movies and avengers endgame infinity war  he s basically the embodiment of an Ne dom ,enfp
When an ENFP is in adolescence  particularly in stressful situations  Fi can often be the most prominent function on display since the auxiliary function is developing   Don t just erase all of his other appearances just because his Fi is so strong in NWH  That s to be expected  And it doesn t erase how much his Ne is also off the charts in that movie as well ,enfp
I m new to instinctual variants  Why sx   sp ,enfp
Very scatterbrained and attuned to external world  an obvious Pe dom  Although his Fi in NWH annoyed the hell out of me  Like how is this dude gonna try to change peoples fates from different universes when like literally a year or two earlier  homie was fighting Thanos for trying to do the same thing lol  So when someone else does it  its wrong  but when he does it  its ok   thats Fi for you ,enfp
Just because she is bossy and critical doesn t mean she is te dom,entj
yet another example of a socially introverted ENTJ i considered ESTJ but her Ni really showed during albedo s event ,entj
Most INTJ votes are because they think having an E in your mbti means being socially outgoing or what ,entj
I doubt very much that she is an extrovert,entj
Te fi axis somewhere in her stack is the only thing I m sure about at this point    ISTJ voters bring up good points  but its out of her voicelines and perhaps story quest too  but in the recent dragonspine event  high ni voters gets an upper hand  a lot of times she tries to connect the dots regarding the whole albedo thing  or atleast seems so  Then again  it could just her te tendency in wanting to know what is going on in amidst of all this  esp when we re never really shown her thought process in reaching her conclusions suspiciouns,entj
Her current IV typing is absolutely horrendous  Sp   Eula my butt  ,entj
O boi  ISTJ vs  INTJ  INTJ vs  ENTJ Fi inf vs  Fi tert  w  vs   w    lots going on right now  There is a great comment like   below this explaining Eula s Fi Te  They said that her Fi is used  childishly   but is undeveloped due to not being able to use it much as a child   now  underdeveloped   inferior I think that  childish  is a great way to describe her use of Fi we use our tertiary functions very playfully  immaturely  or to express ourselves more uniquely than our dom aux functions would  Imma just copy paste my favorite Fi tert description      Tertiary Fi manifests in people wanting to defend their idealism and express their own individuality  They are so used to following a system that this functions nags them to express themselves and remind others that they are their own individual person  like a snowflake  This can lead to bouts of moral righteousness and dictating to others what is right and what is wrong  But it s simply their Te wanting to shout out their personal standards  And such  they may start their very own projects and hobbies that they have always wanted to do since a very early age    I think this describes Eula to a T At least far more accurate than Se tert descriptions I ve read  In my opinion  she shows no signs of repressing denying her Fi  so Fi Te definitely makes sense  BUT obviously I m open to different arguments  as for Ni Se vs  Si Ne  I can t offer my opinion abt it yet   I m withholding my MBTI vote for now so do with this all what you will  I hope that my babbling can at least narrow down some Te dom Te aux arguments    Again I m open to different opinions arguments  and I ll continue to read through all these comments,entj
Eula is not a VLEF  She is very easily a VLFE as she fits the over assertive profile of  V    F    A representative of the VLFE type is an active  active person  Self organization for the sake of achieving goals and everyday self discipline are not a problem for him   on the contrary  they bring pleasure and a feeling of tone  From the outside  Lenin looks like a self confident and decisive person who does not like to postpone things on the back burner  His assertiveness and ambition can both attract and delight people  and repel  especially at close range  It is not easy to keep up with such a person  and the state of pleasant relaxation next to him does not threaten       VLFE is a sober person  He is confident in his conclusions  and it can be very difficult to convince him  But Lenin himself is always ready to explain and argue his point of view  to enter into a discussion or even a furious dispute  He is interested in studying new information  especially if you can look at it from different angles   to study different points of view and draw your own conclusions       At the same time  representatives of this type are not quite confident in themselves when it comes to self expression in the material world  They doubt that they correctly understand their needs  correctly assess their appearance  and often suffer from complexes in this area  To compensate for their discomfort  VLFE can behave aggressively and assertively   violate someone else s personal space  exhaust themselves with diets and sports  clean their apartment to shine  reproach other people if they do not maintain the order  in their opinion  proper  There are also such anecdotal cases when Lenin comes to visit and  unable to ignore the mess and dirt  begins to clean someone else s home       Sentimentality is not characteristic of this type  He is able to maintain a cool head in the most difficult circumstances and not succumb to emotions  Lenin manifests his love and friendship not in sincere conversations and confessions  but in actions  Close people can count on his patronage and support in a difficult situation  In return  they will have to come to terms with his stubbornness and uncompromising attitude       Thus  VLFE is an energetic  persistent person  He strives for self expression in the material world  but complexes fetter him and force him to behave unnaturally  too assertively  Lenin s advantages are also persuasiveness in discussions and the ability not to get lost in critical situations     source     She is far too gutsy to be  F  VLEF is cerebral and known to be the most docile of the  Vs  Socrates  the type representative  was often known by historians as simply a witty but well mannered old man  ,entj
I m gonna be honest I have some problems with her being typed ENTJ that I think should be addressed      When did everyone decide she was an Inferior Fi user  This would imply that she heavily represses and even denies the usage of her Fi in favor of being able to see the world through an objective Te view lens  and while she does do the latter  would she really repress her Fi to do that  Fi is a function that isn t always going to show clearly given that it s an introverted function where one can keep the process of working the function to themselves and this is pretty much the case with Eula  Notice how much it bothers her how much people are unable to see her for  who she is  rather than just a member of the Lawrence Clan and even in the newest event trailer  she mentions that  people never bother to look under the icy exterior   If she was an Inf Fi user  she wouldn t really be so concerned with trying to show off what she uses to back up how she approaches situations and approaching everyone in general  She isn t afraid to use her Fi  but rather she is  childish  with it  so it s there but in great need of development especially due to the fact she couldn t use it much while growing up       However  I think what bothers me more is that everyone was so quick to jump on the bandwagon of her being a Ni user  At first glance  I get why people would feel that way because of how much Eula wants to break free of the rules she s been restricted by her whole life  She claims that she doesn t put much value into them because of how she views them as cruel and unjust and while this is true  there s an important point about all functions that should be made  They aren t always about desires that someone wants to achieve  but rather instincts that come naturally to us  The big arc of Eula s story is that her inferior Ne constantly screws her over when she tries to teach Aether the etiquette of the Lawrence Clan  It doesn t help either that for a Si user  Eula has incredibly high inquisitiveness which while not super common  isn t really out of the question either  Eula has a pretty high sense of curiosity  wanting to expand her boundaries of the world and understand it to become a better person that she never got the chance to be so she could finally stand up for her own beliefs  more tert Fi stuff   However  the reason I claim her to be a Si dom is because her natural instinct  is to utilize any customs that she has already learned before  and as a result she has sorta valued said customs subconsciously  She always speaks to others the way she learned from the Lawrence Clan  and she always follows the etiquette procedures too  Even then  when Eula notices customs that speak to her  she will apply them to herself and make note of their importance to her values  Si Fi   For example  she considers customs like the  Dance of Sacrifice  from her clan which still  puts her in comfort after all these years  and even Liyue s bone whistle which she uses to immitate the sounds of the sea and confuse the enemy  The struggle with her Dom Si Inf Ne is that while she wants to start acting in a way where she can stay true to herself and her values  it would confuse her sense of identity and approach to just break free of all those rules that she s been so used to  Si users  especially inquisitive ones  often feel a struggle between wanting to expand the way they outlook the world  while also wanting to uphold and honor what they ve already learned  subconsciously or not  and that is exactly what Eula struggles with so much  She wants to develop her inferior Ne  but her dominant Si feels uncomfortable abandoning all it knows and as a result  she can come off in a very odd way to people  and it ties in all her functions together  especially the Si Fi    I want to add more to this later but I at least hope it makes more sense to open of why we should open the possibility of ISTJ  or even ESTJ if people can explain Ne Fi  Though I think it s more important right now to distinguish the dominant Si inferior Ne rather than the Tertiary Fi at the moment ,entj
He gives off a Levi Ackerman vibe,entj
 You are entirely average    This line makes me wanna watch the series  But of course putting it on    x speed on Netflix will ruin the fun  I get all the gist just by reading the sypnosis of the episodes though   Maybe some other time  or maybe in my next life  if there s one   I ll watch Umbrella Academy ,entj
Undeniable ENTJ  as others have said he seems to rely on Se more than Ni  very result oriented  clear te se relationship   I think he may be an  w  though  going along with the  result oriented  idea and the fact I don t really see   wing for him  He is very aggressive  for good reason  Although he does have the logical diplomatic skills of a  w  I find that more Te than  w  ,entj
Great  now I get why my friends relate me to him a lot   At least my profile pic now makes sense ,entj
As I recall  he was the only one not really complaining about saving the world on the show   Anyway  he s so fluffy  I wanna crush him ,entj
He s the living incarnate of Se  Shouts a lot  impulsive  wants to acquire power and strength  He also doesn t seem to rely on Ni a lot  he s too result oriented  he doesn t stress about his personal meaning or what he is going to do and is only focused on the  The stronger  rule  ideology that Reginald taught  very focused on acquiring power  and improvement overall  very Typical SLE   Him traveling to the future and ignoring the consequences because of his drive to constantly improve and get stronger sounds like shtty Socio Ni    Well   except when he time traveled back  but that was when he was mentally old anyway  and the trauma he has experienced from surviving    years alone  By that time you can assume he was able to  think through  things ,entj
The real Te dom  and anyone please explain why  w  ,entj
reminds me of kaz brekker a lot,entj
only a  F would wear the same outfit every day out of convenience despite having multiple opportunities to buy new clothes ,entj
Te  Ni and Se are pretty clear  including the scene where he travels to the future by negligence totally refute a Ni dom or Se inf  but I would like his lower Fi to be more developed  in fact  he looks more like a Fe user than Fi kekw   Is there really anyone example of Fi inf ,entj
I m not sure what the Enneagram is  But the   or   in the tritype is extremely strong ,entj
The gayest ENTJ ever ,entj
Definitely EIE  i don t think Dio is SLE   D Ni doesn t make sense  he s very beta NF imo  His main goal was to find  heaven  like pucci  another beta NF   no desire of any material goal  it s true that he likes power but is just for a bigger purpose  very calculist  not saying SLEs can t be  but where he uses Ti creative  Te demonstrative  and Fi polr  Ni creative is evident in how he just waits and only acts when he finds necessary  also Dio is extremely good at reading people s internal feelings and persuade them  that s why he s so charismatic  Dio has always such dramatic  theatrical and expressive attitudes in his appearances  that s seems a bit exaggerated for an SLE imo  Madara is a good example of SLE  much more concrete  realist and pragmatic ,entj
he is the most stereotypical ENTJ  w  choleric dominant ever,entj
Dio is pretty much the textbook example of an ENTJ  w  ,entj
His Fe makes me jealous  ,entj
if he had better developed se at the first episodes of part   non of jojo would ve happened non of jjba would ve happened  very very obvious te dom and inferior fi  in my opinion kind of a unhealthy ENTJ,entj
God  such a healthy Te dom,entj
Throughout part   and    I think it s quiet obvious on how he s an ENTJ and I cant really dislike him because of his actions   His backstory wasn t as deep as I was expecting  but just seeing him act like he has his cool whenever he s with the people he s ordering compared to him fighting a Joestar and being extremely mad and wreckless really says a lot about his character  Still have a like and hate relationship with what I think about Dio  but he s so cool that sometimes I forget that I dislike him LOL,entj
maaan  yall still typing by letters ,entj
this man does not have neither fe nor inf ni  ESTP voters just because he s spontaneous does not make him se dom,entj
Being intuitive in MBTI is not equivalent to being inquisitive in your Big    Sukuna shows low imagination  artistic interests  emotionality  and progressivism ,entj
Sukuna might be extremely impulsive  but he runs everything with a motive  The need to keep Megumi alive  despite knowing that he would never bring him to his side  purely cause of his CT makes me feel like he has stronger Ni than what an ESTP would have  Another instance of Te Ni would be the pact he made with Yuuji    What made me really stick to ENTJ in his case was his CT  MS is perfected to the point that it doesn t have external borders  It is literally described as a painting in the air  I m not saying ESTPs cannot create something like this  but the ability to envision and perfect a domain expansion to the point it almost has zero weakness and has an expansion limit of an entire district screams dom aux Ni to me ,entj
Tell me one good argument for his Te Fi usage  at least one example ,entj
why  E      He s not unbothered by his emotions  he just don t have them,entj
ESTP voters and their arguments are strange   Sukuna does not have tert Fe  Sukuna  a heartless psychopath who has no qualms murdering thousands of innocents    did not just use Fe to read the emotional atmosphere to make Jogo feel better about himself  Because that s what Fe is  Rather  this seems to be his own little personal code  alluding to inferior Fi and the honor that   s possess  THIS seems more plausible  I m fully convinced that if Sukuna DID have Fe as third as opposed to Se  he would have killed Jogo without saying anything  Do you know why this argument is so strong  Because  to say what Sukuna did to Jogo  you need a CAUSE  a REASON  which is his inferior Fi  Someone evil   cruel like Sukuna would never use Fe just to make someone feel better  which is why tert fe arguments are utter garbage   If anything  Sukuna has child Se  as was demonstrated when he was revived after the    fingers and went out to      with the sorcerers outside by playing the clapping game   He s an SLE in socionics  Not an ESTP in MBTI ,entj
Where are the ISFJ and ESFJ votes from  Do Anything But Don t Vote Him under these That      is totally in dumpster fr  ,entj
The thing with him is that his hunger for power probably have something to do with his enneagram  ENTJ and Te in general values efficiency to solving problems we are not just power hungry psychos  His Se is definitely very strong  The only problem with him being a ESTP is that I don t see Fe  Of course tertiary function can be underdeveloped  I just think that ENTJ votes misunderstood his enneagram and temperament for MBTI ,entj
blair waldorf is one of the clearest ESTJ s I have seen  this is my argument for why    first of all  I will not be arguing for Te dom as everyone seems to agree on that one  HOWEVER  the consensus is still voting for her having the Ni Se   Si Ne axis   her scheming seems to be a big part of why people vote ENTJ   after all  she MUST be an Se user if she s able to make realistic plans here and now  but  the thing is  they weren t always realistic  and even if they were  that s not what Se is all about  you can just dissect this obsessive behaviour of hers and it would all make sense   so  why DOES she scheme in the first place   it makes her feel like she s in control  blair likes knowing the result of her own actions and predicting what will happen next with reliable info of what she s already experienced in the past  blair uses Ne to conduct the grandiose plans and she s so confident about them working out because they have worked in the past and she heavily relies on those same actions to work again  think about it   blair doesn t accept changes or new environmental situations easily  her perception of reality is warped and she sees it in an incredibly subjective way  for example  when one of her connections or plans get interrupted or when she s having a problem she cannot solve  she doesn t just see it as it is   an issue    but as a crumbling down stairway to her umpire  to her perfect life  to how things SHOULD be by her vision  which was the entire reason she was trapped in this cycle of vicious behaviour and implemented negative patterns over and over again in her life  here s a conversation with her and nate  who  by the way  is an Se user   nate    do you remember when you used to make us watch your favourite movies over and over again  it used to drive me nuts  well  I finally asked you why you liked watching movies you ve already seen  and remember what you said  blair    I like knowing how things are gonna turn out    nate    exactly    s  ep     blair plans  and she does so obsessively  her life was pretty much something she wanted to go perfectly as she had imagined it before  just look at serena   an amazing Se dom example    most of the time she just went with the flow and wasn t highly set on a specific routine or a way of doing things for that matter  if you genuinely step aside from your tiny screen and think about how blair s plans would ve gone realistically  you would be able to tell they were DRAMATIC  and if it weren t for her Si confidence boost  it would be just borderline unrealistic and too high of an expectation  as serena often said  blair s schemes are actually crazy because they have no guarantee other than her own Si telling her that it will work out just like every other time   blair finds immense comfort in the familiarity of things and always moulds her environment to fit that  she feels at a loss in new situations because that isn t what she s used to and it probably internally scares her that her life isn t going by this orderly structure that ensures things go smoothly  blair does not cope well with unpredictability   as for Ne   it s lower than Si since it is tertiary  but besides the scheming which I covered in the previous paragraphs  you can see it in the way she almost compulsively cannot resist the urge to stay still until she s explored all the possibilities for someone s actions  by the way  her Si way of remembering details with surprisingly good preciseness when in times of crisis is what she uses as a tool to help her convince others of the chance that one of her previously proposed possibilities of something is true   and that concludes ESTJ   ENTJ for our girlboss blair waldorf ,entj
You guys are just simping for her and want her to be an N  because they re  smarter      BECaUsE sHe S BaDaSs aNd I KiN hEr  ShE mUsT be aN InTuitIve    If you look at the functions  the truth couldn t be more obvious    The ENTJ voters are being unreasonable  Like they re making their own script about Blair s desires and fears like they wrote the series themselves   Let s face it  if you guys met a girl like her in real life  replace her face with an average face   would you like her  Of course not   Joke s on you  you are fooling yourselves   And that s coming from an ENTJ ,entj
this argument will be in portuguese but it s very important that you translate  bcuz i will explain in depth why she is ESTJ and the obvious SiNe  the same way ENTJ voters don t see arguments for SI we don t see good arguments for NI    primeiro vou falar um pouco sobre a personalidade em geral da blair  blair tem uma personalidade forte  confiante  muito manipuladora e ambiciosa  blair tem uma enorme desconfian a de todo mundo ao redor dela  incluindo seus amigos e at  mesmo sua melhor amiga  ela   muito insegura  ent o sempre fica na defensiva com medo que algu m possa superar ela  empurrando qualquer pessoa que possa estar na sua frente  apesar de tudo ela   uma garota muito leal e sempre disposta a ajudar seus amigos quando ela n o odeia eles claro  ela   uma garota sonhadora que quer ter um futuro brilhante assim como sua m e  ela sempre foi bastante dedicada na sua faculdade apesar dos seus atos  blair sempre aproveitou seu presente  mas  nunca esqueceu sobre seu futuro  principalmente na temporada    isso   geralmente uma desculpa para SE  ela vive no momento  ela aproveita o momento mas n o vive completamente nele     todo mundo tem uma vis o sobre SI  uma vis o completamente esteriotipada nada al m de ser preso no passado e n o gostar de mudan as  mas n o  SI est  muito al m disso  eu estudei MUITO sobre SI e estou chocado com tantas informa  es sobre  e como essas informa  es s o esquecidas  eu vou apenas focar em SiNe porque o Te dela    bvio ent o vamos l     blair n o   adapt vel  usu rios SE s o espont neos e conseguem se adaptar facilmente em novas situa  es  blair n o   assim  um exemplo  georgina   uma SE dom  um  timo exemplo de pessoa que consegue se adaptar facilmente em uma nova situa  o  criando uma m scara social e usando o sistema ao seu favor  Ti Fe   blair tem uma grande dificuldade de adapta  o  exemplo quando ela teve que passear com o namorado do pai dela  ela estava com muita dificuldade de se adaptar com seu padrasto  claro que   normal achar dif cil de se lidar com isso  mas existem outras maneiras de conviver  o que n o aconteceu com ela     outro exemplo foi quando ela entrou na realeza  ela estava com muita dificuldade de se adaptar com um novo ambiente que ela n o estava acostumada  um ambiente onde ela tinha controle e poder  o que foi um choque para ela  ela estava for ando ela mesma a se acostumar com aquela nova vida    outro exemplo foi quando ela foi para faculdade  era uma situa  o completamente nova para ela pois ela n o tinha nenhum minion e ningu m para seguir suas ordens  nenhuma familiaridade e padr es para ela seguir  foi ent o que ela fez outro ex rcito de minions  isso tamb m entra em um fato curioso  blair tem um grande medo de mudan as dr sticas em sua vida  tanto que ela continuou agindo como uma adolescente mesmo quando ela estava adulta  est    uma das principais caractericas da blair que indica que ela tem SI    blair   muito espec fica  exigente e seletiva  voc  claramente v  isso com sua lista de exig ncias de coisas para entrar no seu grupo  o que elas vestem  os pr s e contras das garotas  personalidade etc  tudo muito espec fico  o que pode indicar um  timo uso de TeSi  usu rios de NI tendem a ver coisas como um sistema geral sem varia  es espec ficas como sendo necess rias  n o apenas isso  ela sempre tem uma raiva muito espec fica com algumas pessoas  um  timo exemplo   jenny  quando ela voltou para nova york sem interesse em brigas  blair insistiu em brigas passadas  para alimentar seu ego e poder  o que me faz pensar que blair   na verdade         seu senso de controle e poder  ela   uma pessoa muito agressiva e dominante  que faz um grande contraste com seu TE dominante  ela sabe seu poder e ama estar no controle das situa  es  eu n o vejo muito  w   w  nela  se algu m puder me explicar melhor    blair   uma pessoa com uma mente muito fechada  tornando ela uma pessoa imatura todo tempo  ela n o   aberta para novas opini es e  ngulos  o que um NI geralmente faria  ela acha que sua verdade   uma  nica verdade  eu como ESTJ posso confirmar que tive uma mente fechada para v rias situa  es muitas vezes  incluindo negar meu SI  eu e blair temos isso em comum por conta de nossos SI  temos opini es fortes e concretas  dif ceis de ser mudadas     SI leva voc  a ver qualquer coisa fora de um contexto familiar como perigoso e indigno de confian a    isso grita blair  todo o tempo quando algo sa  de algo que ela n o est  acostumada  como perder por exemplo  ela fica extremamente na defensiva tentando derrubar todo mundo ao redor dela  um  timo exemplo disso   quando Serena foi para Yale e Blair n o  ent o ela come ou a tratar sua melhor amiga muito mal     SI leva voc  a geralmente proteger sua integridade das coisas e sinais dos quais dependemos  ISSO   blair    com isso est  mais que  bvio que blair   uma usu ria de SI  eu poderia colocar mais exemplos aqui mas isso ficaria muito longo mas isso j    o suficiente  certo     part   in the comments ,entj
Inquisitive in Big   is a bigger joke than her being an ENTJ  To all of the ENTJ voters who are screaming she uses Se   Si  when exactly  This girl has never spent a single second relaxing and enjoying the moment  And it s so obvious that none of the Ni voters study Jung  Jungs Ni has absolutely nothing to do with scheming  Jungs Si however would be more related to that  Any dislikes will just prove my point that the people typing do not study Jung ,entj
I can see anyone ENTJ or ESTJ  by the Te dom that really makes a lot of sense in it I could vote for her for anyone  so if someone presents me with a valid argument for ESTJ   i change my vote,entj
ENTJ this ESTJ that yeah yeah yeah can we talk about her big   mistype    Blair   Inquisitive   Literally impossible,entj
U stupids shes definitely not an ESTJ shes ENTJ just  w  but shes such an ENTJ,entj
It seems to me that people vote for ENTJ because of Blair s advanced Se  when the Si is obviously bigger than an Ni  Some people forget that tertiary function sometimes develops only by the age of thirty or forty  and therefore many do not see her tertiary Ne  Blair  as she herself said many times  sees the bad in people  is fixated on the past  wanted to enter only Yell and categorically rejected other options  because Yell was a family tradition  Yes  she thinks about the future  she has ambitions and goals  but this is a healthy Te  isn t it  Many people on this site think that the dominant Te is automatically included with the auxiliary Ni  although this is not at all the case ,entj
So I used to think she was ENTJ at first but now that i really finished the show multiple times and analysed her personality more  ESTJ makes more sense  We pretty much all agree she is Te dom and Fi inf    but she does not have a high level Ni  as a usual ENTJ would  She is very structured and always has her set of rules that she expects everyone to obey  which is a clear representation of Si ,entj
Her Ni is immensely visible  the final showdown in the end is a direct proof for the Te Ni combination  Cruella has such distinct Ni that could even be her dominant function yet inferior Se just doesn t make any sense for her  On top of that  Te dom is also clear as well ,entj
Can somebody explain to me why she is sx so   I thought sx is her blind spot     isn t it mostly about one to one connections  Also she didn t show any interest in being in a relationship or being really close with anybody,entj
pls don t immediately downvote me lmao but i think ESFP makes more sense than ENTJ   i just posted this on the other board too   i agree that she s the same person so her type is the same but i think ESFP in both cases makes so much more sense  there s no way her Fi is inf  literally all of her decisions came from a place of inner motivation  ie a Ji function  so either Ti or Fi  and in this scenario i think we can all agree that she uses way more Fi Te than Ti Fe  if we compare cruella estella to the baroness  who i m assuming is a Te dom  i think there s a pretty clear difference in the way that they approach their similar behaviours  every cruel thing the baroness does is done from a place of objectivity   she does not care about the fates of those she s hurting  she just does what s best for her or her name  compare that to cruella estella who is completely motivated by revenge and avenging her mother  her motivation is coming from a place of subjectivity  i wrote this all really quick so i hope it makes sense lmao but in short if we re debating what she struggles with more  i think it s Ni  always open to other opinions  but this was my impression after watching,entj
The ENTJ votes     that s the real devil  I ruined it lol ,entj
How can someone be more SX   than Cruella    Beatrice Chestnut s description of SX eights    Sexual Eights have a strong antisocial tendency  People with this subtype are provocative people who express lust through open rebellion  through declaring in word and deed that their values differ from the norm  Along with being the most rebellious of the Eight subtypes  the Sexual Eight is  interestingly  also the most emotional   This outspoken  rebellious Eight likes to be sen as bad   or at least they don t mind it   and they tend not to feel any guilt over the rebellious things they do  It s almost a matter of pride for Sexual Eights to go against the stream of convention or to disrespect rules and laws   The name given to the Sexual Eight is  Possession   which refers to a kind of charismatic taking over  or dominance  of the whole environment  an energetic capture of people s attention  These Eights display the idea of  Possession  in that they can take over a whole scene energetically  becoming the center of things  Sexual Eights like to feel their power by possessing everyone s attention  They express the idea that the world begins to run when they arrive  ,entj
I m concerned as to why so many people think she s voted as a      because she s evil   Have you considered    that she just fits the tritype well  Strong   traits  but an overall   core  That is cruella  It has nothing to do with if she s evil or not  because being an   has nothing to do with if you re evil or not  It just seems like a weird argument to make in the first place    ,entj
Not sure if ENFP or ENTJ  but Te   Fi is obvious  The movie sucks though   w  is quite obvious if we look at her childhood which represents the rebellious nature of an    She lacks the desire to be truly unique of a    her fashion escapades stem more from a desire to be in control and rebel against what she finds unjust  w  adds the flare of extra ness and interest towards fashion ,entj
I don t really get ENTJ    I think that s kind of based on false stereotypes  She seems like an fi user sx  to me,entj
Ah yes  everyone knows dominant Te children love disobeying directions and doing whatever they want consequences be damned and then decide to become an overbearing arrogant stereotypical  ENTJ  to fuel their career and as revenge to appease their inner child as an adult  Yes this is very much an ENTJ ,entj
ESFP because she likes to dress up,entj
Yes  he is generally an ENTJ  but after the death note  I have no doubt that before the death note he had another personality type  In fact  the death note turned him into an ENTJ Maybe if I had something like that I would become an ENTJ  who knows  ,entj
I understand why ppl might think that Light is a moral perfectionist  i e  w   but I interpret his crusade with the Death Note as coming from his hatred towards the idea of criminals  rather than coming from a place of wanting to help ppl  I always saw him as hating how lowlifes control others and how that s led more of the world to be swayed by criminals who go properly unpunished  this to me being  w  behaviour  rather than a    his motive isn t really about perfecting the world for the sake of others  I see it as just wanting to punish those he hates     Tho my main piece of evidence of why I think he can t be a   at all is the fact that he was willing to kill the criminal  who at the time he thought was L  all because his pride was wounded  I think this was in ep     Essentially  that makes Light a hypocrite cos he was murdering someone for the sake of pride  meaning he went against a principle ,entj
I don t understand why Light Yagami is mistyped as an ENTJ when its quite clear that he isn t  He is an ISFP and in all honesty  it could be argued that he s an ESFJ but I personally believe that his cognitive functions suit ISFP more  Firstly  he exhibits characteristics and his thought process follows a methodology  or  lack there of  that ISFPS have  He believes that his ideas and values regarding morality are correct and the best for the world which essentially is a good example of unhealthy and controlling Fi  He resorts to violence and manipulation to obtain the control and to do what he believes is best for not just his close acquaintances  but for the whole world  His usage of Se is self explanatory  he obtains information using perception and external sensations from the present  As for his tertiary Ni usage  he is able to use his primary functions in order to predict and connect what happens in his internal system  Lastly  he seeks structure and efficiency  Inferior Te      Argue with a wall  it s clear that I m right ,entj
The xNFJ votes throw me off just a tiny bit    whether trolling or not  If there is one thing that continues to happen when typing villian character there is always the argument of  Oh well they are manipulative so obviously they re an ENFJ   My INFJ friend labels herself as this whether joking or not and it makes me completely uncomfortable  makes me feel like I can t even trust xNFJs you dumb motherfuckers   referring to xNFJ voters   With that out of the way    Fe users are good at understanding what other people want  Fe Se is extremely good at this  However  ENFJs are more concerned with the unity of groups of people and what OTHER people want  Not  what works  something that Light shows to be very oriented with when it comes to the ideas of right and wrong  As well if Light were an ENFJ he would probably get caught way sooner  throw ENFJ and INTP into a chess game who is gonna win   metaphor for inferior Ti   Light at first glance when it comes to his morals however does have this idea of  Hey  this is most beneficial to humanity   but Light would have different means for his ends ,entj
why  E instead of  E   sorry if someone already done a argument on this  i didn t see it ,entj
Okay  so let s talk about how sx blind became the dominant votes  I m still learning about Instinctual Variant  but I think these results are strange  Sexual   tries to change others according to their principles and expresses anger if they reject this  This is literally Light  He also shows many characteristics of Social    but focuses on reforming the world rather than directly appearing in front of people as a just model   And he did a lot of reckless things  such as killing fake L and trying to set an example because his ideal was insulted  but he frequently reviewed various details to avoid being caught by L and the police  Wouldn t Choleric Melancholic be better ,entj
Definite INFP  He has a lot of umm what s it called like Fi or something,entj
i m extremely shocked i don t see more arguments for sx     sp   on here     social  s  claim to know what is right and just  and will ensure that society lives by these rules and ideals  they re on a virtuous crusade to reclaim the holy land from chaos  corruption and disorder  they can be quite political and preachy about what they believe  and making sure others live by these rules as well  they know what is right  moral and just   this is just exactly light  everything described is exactly how he thinks  the reasons behind all of his actions are to reform the society he believes to be corrupt     sexual  s  counteract the typical   s fear of corruption by not really caring about their own corruption  but holding a strong prejudice towards the corruption of others  they outwardly project an anti corrupt message and personality  but rather than fight their corruption and overcome it  choose instead to merely hide it   anyone want to tell me how this is NOT light in any capacity   i m still trying to determine whether he s sx so   or so sx    self preservation one doesn t even come into the picture  yet he s typed as a so sp    sx BLIND      self preservation  s  want to be the best they can  highly disciplined  and applies their high standards to themselves without any leeway  these ones primarily focus on avoiding their own corruption over that of others   when has light ever cared about evading his own corruption  he didn t  he simply became corrupt and chose to ignore that fact   either very anxious or self controlled  this subtype channels concerns about survival and security into material achievements as a way to be a good person and do the right thing  it seems important to subdue nature and to impose order on the natural world  however  too much self sacrifice can fuel physical tension and resentment   sure  while this description could be fitting for light somewhat when the descriptions of the other subtypes of enneagram   fit him so well  i don t think there is any debating his sx   so far outweigh sp ,entj
HEAR ME OUT Y ALL  I see higher Fi than Se  Se inferior and Ni dominant can manifest as a lack of realism in the approach to achieving one s goals  he had a hugely inflated sense of self and saw himself as a god for no reason other than happening to come across the Death Note by chance   and Ni Fi looping can explain his obsession with mapping out a future  Ni  based upon his own sense of morality  Fi  without considering any of the practical implications of it  low Se  ,entj
Funniest part is that people are saying that he was an INTJ when he forgot his memories but tbh that wasn t even a INTJ variant of him he had a very specific moral compass at the time and a pretty obvious healthy ISFP such an obvious fi dom qt the time with a well developed se and ni and good usage of te anyone willing to debate that ,entj
i wish i was born as ENTJ or ISTP,entj
I want my life back ,entj
I m happy to see that SCOAI is leading    I feel special as if I had just heard the biggest compliment of my life ,entj
I like myself overall but I think being extroverted and high energy  having more Te and generally being more comfortable with confrontation would solve like     of the problems I currently have lmao,entj
They re very cool people,entj
I LOVE ENTPS THEY ARE HOT IDK IF I WANNA BE THEM OR MARRY THEM           ,entj
second is ENTJ,entj
                                                         ,entj
i want to be cool,entj
It s really hard to choose cause I really like my Ni  but inferior Se is killing me  And I also like my Ti  so don t wanna have it as the inferior function too  Plus  Te Ni seems like a really good balance in order to make your dreams practical  But  at the same time  my dreams literally revolve around Ni Fe and Ni Ti  But still  I guess ENTJ for the win to me ,entj
If it s pretty much agreed on that he s TeNi  then why is there still a mess in his profile  Im assuming it s because of other systems   Guys  please keep in mind that he s very results focused and that itself should indicate strong Te  Bakugou is all about getting things done  His top focus isn t being present in the moment  experiencing life to the fullest  or understanding why things operate the way they do  His top objective is to get the outcomes he desires  as he has a clear vision of what he wants to be in the future  To Te  objective facts and measurable results are everything  He s also lot more concerned in putting the logic he s gathered to good use and  getting things done    Bakugou appreciates looking forward to the future more than being involved and in sync with others around him  which is more Se   Fe in character  outside of fight  He has a knack for foreseeing opponents in combat and was one of the few to notice a hidden link between Izuku s All for One power and All Might  His weapons have symbolic value for him   Bakugou works hard for his victories because his inferior function feels that it would be pointless if he didn t give it his best and battle to the last finish  There s no purpose  he says  if he can t stand on top of the globe without a strong cause ,entj
I think you guys might be confusing   with social three  Bakugo s childhood isn t the one of an    it s the one of a three  He was always admired and praised for his abilities  but let me refer to Chestnut for comparison    The Social Three has a desire to be seen and to have influence with people  This three acts out in vanity through the desire to shine before the whole world  Social Threes enjoy being on stage  This subtype is the most vain of the Threes       The Social Three is very concerned with competition and winning  This is the most competitive Three  They are also focused on power  whether or not they are the one who has it  They tend to be demanding and authoritarian  though these characteristics may be hidden behind a presentation that is smooth  decorous  and humorous  Social Threes may view others in terms of how they potentially further or block the process of reaching their goals  They look at things in terms of how they can exert control over them  and they don t allow themselves to be surprised by life    They might look a lot like  s a like because of how assertive and strong they are  Also  Bakugou seems to have a social   fix  a typical social antisocial  with behaviors that are frowned upon but focused on doing the  right thing   becoming a hero    Also  I don t think he s sx  If anything  he s interested in  suceeding and becoming the number one  to be seen as the mightiest by everybody  so    and himself  His character development shows how he starts to connect to others  sx  and understand others  but it s not his natural drive ,entj
       Before I start  if you want to see the previous argument showing why he s not a    and how he fits an   much better via  core type  and it s key characteristics   doesn t fit the origin and nature of the key characteristics and source of envy of a      https   www personality database com comment            Let s now  instead of resorting to subtypes  take a further look at how Bakugo fits the characteristics of an    according to Naranjo    He is convinced that everybody at bottom is malevolent and crooked   that friendly gestures are hypocritical   that it is only wisdom to regard everyone with distrust  unless he has been proved honest  But even such proof will readily make room for suspicion at the slightest provocation       I didn t need your stupid help  But you looked at me like I was some kind of weakling       demonstrates his disdain for weakness  which belongs to an      the complete and utter misinterpretation of Deku s motives here  which fits what is described above  Deku is  at the bottom  and he sees him as just that  malevolent to him  chasing him not out of admiration but in trying to overcome him    In his behavior towards others he is openly arrogant  often rude and offensive  although sometime this is covered with a thin veneer of civil politeness  In subtle and gross ways  with or without realizing it  he humiliates others and exploits them    With a seemingly naive egocentricity  he will use people as a means to an end  He frequently makes and maintains contacts exclusively on the basis of their serving his needs for triumph  people he can use as stepping stones in his career    followers who give him blind recognition and augment his power      Note the way he treated his classmates as a child and middle schooler wanting that blind recognition from his followers  how he would purposefully humiliate Deku and call him a failure to boost his own ego  that egocentricity  how he uses people such as his classmates as means to ends in the Cavalry battle and such  He even ADMITS to using his classmates as stepping stones here   ,entj
There s     k votes on Bakugo s page  but only     IV votes  which should really emphasize just how much of an uphill battle fixing Bakugo s profile is  If only      people know about the instincts  that s  k people who still think   is just a brooding  emo type that doesn t fit Bakugo at all      and   fit him far better than    and even then  SX   fits him far better than SP    However you wanna put it  Bakugo is mistyped    I ll go ahead and reference one last book    Transformation Through Insight        by Claudio Naranjo  pg         In E   ENVY IS THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC ELEMENT AT THE MOTIVATIONAL LEVEL  ENVY INVOLVES A PAINFUL COMPARISON BETWEEN SELF AND OTHERS THAT MAY BE FELT AS WORTHLESSNESS  COMPETITIVE RAGE OR AN EXCESSIVE STRIIVNG FOR MERIT  Envy can be focused on specific people   as for example  a brother or sister  or generally  as with envy of the opposite sex  or envy of the privileged or wealthy    Transformation Through Insight        by Claudio Naranjo  pg         The subtypes of E  are as differentiated as the varieties of E   and there is a sharp contrast between the angry  sexual  and the sad  social   while the first is complaining and explicitly demanding  the latter is too shy to express his or her desires  except through an intensification of suffering   as if to convey   See how much I need help      The angry  sexual  type was caricatured by Dickens through Mrs  Grumble  in David Copperfield  Freud  in his psychoanalytic work  observed the pattern in his description of  those who feel exceptional  by which he meant THOSE WHO FEEL THAT LIFE IS IN DEBT TO THEM AND THAT THIS GIVES THEM RIGHT TO ADVANTAGES  He gives Shakespeare s Richard III as an example      Transformation Through Insight        by Claudio Naranjo  pg         Sexual E  persons are USUALLY ARROGANT  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A GENERALIZED SENSE OF INFERIORITY AND ARE PRONE TO GUILT  Take  for example  the vision of Oedipus in Pasolini s film  His way of standing in the road along which his father s carriage approaches might be through the attitude of an E  person  BUT E  S ARROGANCE  AS WELL AS PROTEST AND INVASIVENESS  IS MROE VISIBLY AN OVER COMPENSATION  There is a conscious pain of feeling misunderstood  and an arrogant attitude is adopted in order to be recognized    Everyone around Bakugo told him he was the best  Everyone said he was gifted  everyone said he was amazing  and he thought that because everyone said it  it must be true   only that  no matter what anyone did  no matter what the facts or the results told him  it never felt true to Bakugo    Everything Bakugo has tried to do in the series is to confirm what everyone has told him  but no matter what he does  he doesn t believe it  He never has  He might think he s good  he might think he could one day be the best  but ever since they were children and even now  Bakugo has and continues to feel inferior to Midoriya  always needing to compare himself to him and always falling short    Even when the heroes praised him after holding off the sludge monster  Bakugo felt inferior to Midoriya    Even when he got into UA  Bakugo still had to focus on the fact that Midoriya got in too  accusing Midoriya of ruining his dreams    Even when he was given an assignment by UA with Iida against Midoriya and Uraraka  Bakugo still had to try and prove his worth against Midoriya and convince himself that he was better than him  even if it meant forgetting about the match    Even when he won first place in the UA Festival  Bakugo still had to focus on the fact that Midoriya did something he couldn t do  pushing Todoroki to use his flames    Even when Bakguo himself finally admits that he bullied Midoriya because he felt inferior to him and hated feeling less than him  people still don t believe him    Bakugo has ALWAYS been compensating for that feeling of inferiority he feels towards Midoriya  and if people won t take HIS own word for it  then I dunno    This character is far more complex than just the disgustingly simple    bully  profile he s been shoehorned into  and it s a shame he didn t get the analysis and comprehension he deserved       ,entj
For those of you who voted ISFP  since when did he have inferior Te   Te is not only a function of assertiveness  ambition and work ethic  which Bakugo himself fits this statement behaviorally  Te is a function based on an external logical judgment  which means seeing logic according to what others have agreed with and using it efficiently such as sources  formulas  etc  We can see that he is a type of person who constantly judge rather than perceive  and his assessment is based on objective sources that have been publicly recognized  Even his  Non Curious  personality stems from the mindset of  wouldn t do that if it didn t match some standard or was pointless useless  which has always been his grip as a character  Te know how to use their knowledge in a more efficient way and Bakugo is no exception  since he often inductive thinking at applying his logic in a useful and rewarding action  He s very ambitious  like extra ambitious  He would purposely ignore his own desires and morale as if so that the goals he had planned could be completed in an instant  effectiveness  Just because he s emotional and unhealthy  doesn t mean that he has a lower Te since being irrational   feeler  Even Dominant Thinkers have their time not to be rational  people aren t always rational anyway    Sure  Bakugo has Fi  but the Fi he uses is unhealthy and out of control  The dominant function is a function that we can control healthily while the inferior function is a function that s difficult for us to control  since they manage us  not us manage them  but this is just my theory related to function analogy  And even though he has low Fi  he still has it in his stack function so this doesn t mean he never uses it at all  He has a very  very hard time tuning in and expressing his feelings  or even he thinks that emotions are just a lump of self feeling that interferes with success in life  Do we really have to rest and enjoy the activities we love if that is an obstacle to my successful live  Why should we follow the moral principle of all when there are more effective things we can do  That s more or less how Bakugo perceives his weak function as a demon interfering with his dominant function s learning  Bakugo always aspired to be a hero and this is not a secret  like Deku   but his goal more or less has no deep meaning other than  he wants to be the No   hero  or  so that I can beat Deku   A Fi dom will aspire to be something if their conscience approves it no matter how big small the salary is  ridiculed because they aspire to be something that doesn t make sense to people and make everything a competition with certain people   He s also a pretty obvious Ni Se user  You might think he s in a Te Se loop because he s totally impulsive but actually he uses his Ni most of the time  Intuitive Introverts are focused inward  on the internal world of thoughts  ideas  and concepts  When Ni is combined with extraverted thinking  Te   as in the case of an INTJ or ENTJ  insights  hunches  etc  may be more focused on complex systems  concepts  objects  products than people  Se is also quite clear from how focused he is with his surroundings as opposed to having to think about possibilities and ideas  like doesn t he likes seeing something  what is it   Se  rather than have to change something through the  what can be made of  thought process  Ne      When Te doms rely too heavily upon Te and suppress Fi  they will develop an overly narrow and inflexible view of the world  Instead of using Fi appropriately to foster a nuanced and tolerant worldview  Te will use Fi to justify problematic beliefs and actions  In other words  Te will develop a maladaptive tendency to seek so called moral rationalizations to explain adherence to whatever  objective  standards rules they believe in  utilizing a starkly categorical conception of reality to make judgments and decisions quickly  only caring about procuring external rewards  sometimes at the expense of personal integrity   When Te is not functioning in a healthy manner  Te doms will be more prone to displaying rash or insensitive behaviors as well as black and white overgeneralizing that negatively affects personal human well being  and this can lead to a gradual buildup of feelings of incompetence or insecurity  especially when they are unable to achieve important goals or develop meaningful relationships as smoothly as they would like to   Boom  the ultimate Te Ni Se Fi,entj
Why are there so many votes for ESTP  Bakugo is definitely an ENTJ for these reasons     His Te is way stronger than his Se  This is apparent because although he is very observant  he much more associates with Te  He uses very direct language and whenever anyone says anything he doesn t believe in  he immediately contradicts them  He doesn t really understand those who are emotional    His Ni is strong  This is portrayed in almost every fight scene with Bakugo  He always has a plan and  dare I say  he s always one step ahead of everyone    He has no Fe at all   He s not caring or harmonizing  He doesn t care about the emotions of others   I don t understand why anyone would say he is an ESTP  That confuses me ,entj
i write well in english but i have a bit of a difficulty handling my thoughts in another language so i apologize for any misspelled or weird writing          bakugou grew up with a mother who was just as explosive as he is  who put him on a pedestal for nothing but his quirk  he learned that he was strong and imposing because of his power  a big power  after all he BLOWS things up   bakugou has willpower  dexterity  and cunning but don t have what deku has   deku managed to be as powerful as bakugou is and yet never bullied anyone  he never denied team work  he was never afraid to cry  he never stopped helping even those who mistreated him    having a quirk   powerful  dominant  no one ever will come near you  bc you blow things up  and people consider you the greatest bc of it  you don t need emotions  empathy or vulnerabily to be the bigger man ever  having no quirk   people will come for you just like you come for them  you ll be hurt  you ll cry    saying that  i m making things up  when i say that bakugou is ONLY jealous of midoriya s capacity of being  weak   quirkless  and yet vulnerable emotionally open to others is the same as saying that you ve never watched or consumed any bnha media lol                      people confuse a lot of aggressiveness with se  Bakugou is a great example of an immature te ni  who cannot see the raw reality because of so many believed things drawn between the lines  or misinterpreted things he converged into a  symbol  or a broken metaphorical truth   hence the  i ll be a bigger hero than you   thing he has with deku   such a repressed internal feeling  a moral and an interpersonal connection with the environment so terrible done that it prevents him from achieving his dream goal  he can t understand truly what it is to be a hero  and until he doesn t connect and accept his inherent vulnerability  he will never improve and he will never evolve as a character itself    i know the ISFP  sx voter is a troll but i honestly can t see such a sloppy speech getting attention like that   but explain to me  how did an ISFP  sx took so long to see its own Achilles  heel  how can someone with unconscious  inf external thinking use the function more than its dominant one       he is clearly relying on external critical thinking  achieving results based on internal analysis  external application  ni te converging information and transforming it into something applicable in the environment society itself   he is NOT relying on the creation of his own artistic or emotional impression of an environment  person or object with his direct sensory approach  fi se    he clearly has difficulty connecting with his fi and misinterpreting his learned logic that vulnerable loser  he is clearly terrified of others taking advantage of him  clearly terrified of being emotional and terrified of FEELING things   of course this is the definition of a    not an    lmao,entj
ISFP    I mean   I don t know man I just have a hard time trying to buy it   Why would Bakugo have inferior Te  It s been a while since I ve seen the show  but I don t remember an instance when it was a hard function for him to use ,entj
Hi  could someone please explain to me why Bakugo s a sp   instead of a sx    I recently read the Enneagram subtype descriptions and I think he fits better the description of a sexual   ,entj
fi dom   core means a lot of emotional introspection and being self aware of the inner feeling of being too sensitive  unique  out of place and being unable to fit in or be seen as part of something  they are completely focused on finding their inner selves    both  s and  s are reactives  but lets see the difference between these two types based on how they react to conflict      Fours want to understand themselves  They feel that something is missing in themselves   others seem to have a strong sense of who they are   but Fours feel that they haven t found their sense of self yet  They know what they are not  but they don t know what they are  Fours seek a rescuer   someone who sees and appreciates the special qualities that the Four sees in herself      Eights can get into conflict by being too willful  defiant and confrontational  Eights tend to not censor their own impulses or emotional reactions  Eights want to feel the realness of conflict to give themselves a stronger sense of being  When conflicts occur  Eights are very quick to challenge and confront them  Eights keep their guard up all the time and want to minimize their dependence on  and trust in  others  They do not want others to see their vulnerable side   bakugou fears being emotionally vulnerable  he has little to none understading of his inner self and what he believes or feels deeply  he sees the world as a battle arena and he needs to fight so they don t take advantage of him  he is the spitting image of a sp      the whole midoriya bullying thing was bakugou hating on someone who can do what he cant  be emotionally open  sweet and vulnerable    please let my boy be a ENTJ   in peace  ,entj
why would anyone think shes an ESFP   she quite literally reeks of Te dom  Se dom does not make sense with her at all   Te Ni Se is the best fit for her imo  i cannot see her using Se as a dom function  and Fi aux   maybe that could be confused for because of her slight selfishness but regardless ,entj
I mean I could see her as an ESFP but inf fi makes more sense for the way she deals with emotions  I can t see her as a   tho she s an obvious   I mean goals  seeking attention and validation  showing off  hard to cooperate with  creates different personas and has a hard time understanding which of these personas is her true self   ,entj
Those of you who are comparing this girl to Bakugou irritate me a lot  you are saying that she is Sedom for being explosive like Bakugou or for having attitudes  minimaly similar for the simple fact that they are both noisy  I don t see this girl as Se dom and I don t know how this is becoming a popular opinion  I may change my mind later on but that s not the case now   I m really bad at typing others and I haven t watched the evangelion movies just the    episode series  so maybe I m talking nonsense  Asuka is a goal oriented character  focused on external rewards  others  approval   she understands what she needs to do to achieve this even if it goes wrong  She feels that everything will be better if she is the one in control  which is obviously a stereotype but still a feature of the Te role   she tries to reach her goals quickly but always creates a mess  She s always judging Shinji because she thinks he s less competent than she is  so she s always yelling  which comes a lot from Te and Se lol  and trying to impose orders  She is a character who is very focused on rewards like I said  so she acts very rigidly and absolutist with herself and others around her so I think she is an extj unhealthy but still a Te dom  You guys can correct me if I m wrong  that s just what I think at the moment ,entj
I saw some people on tik tok saying shes ESFP  can someone explain,entj
      Read this in order to be convinced how she is not a Se dom or ESFP since the votes have increased because of Tiktok   You know what  I can t really see Se dom Asuka  These ESFP arguments state that they can t see dominant Te in her because she s too impulsive and reckless  immerses herself into high risk situations and fights and all things that indicate her usage of Se  which are accurate and tremendously discerned  of course  But there is no way she uses Se as a primary approach towards the surroundings around her  Tell me  does she seek physical stimuli or thrills and novel experiences as her top focus more  Or does she primarily use her Se to achieve results and outcomes she want in accordance to objective metrics and external logical judgement   Let s compare Asuka to an another ENTJ who prefers Se  Bakugo Katsuki from My Hero Academia who is very heavily mistyped as Se dom  Many argue that he displays any form of impulsivity and risky actions therefore his Se is dominant  but the claim fails to convince due to the fact that he uses Se method to guide his Te aims  his results oriented nature and somehow  the end justifies the means  attitude towards his goals   Take a read of this argument from on Bakugou s page and apply it to Asuka s way of approaching things    bakugou uses his se to collect environmental data and then apply it to his own understanding of external empirical information  in other words  his se is guided by his te  it acts accordingly to his te  and his te only   an ESFP would subconsciously use te to maximize and understand physical and tangible experiences  an ESTP would do the same  but with fe  it is clear that both of these tendencies are nowhere to be seen in bakugou s behavior    Now going back to Asuka  she lacks the receptive nature or openness towards sensory data of a Se dom would be  She doesn t also principally prioritizes living to the fullest moment and seeking novelty at all  She is more attuned to judging data based on an objective logical scale of things  empirical knowledge and external standards  Look back when Asuka boasts to Shinji in Episode   because of how precise and consummate her fighting technique is   What do you think  Third Child  A fight should be clean  elegant and without waste   She is applying external laws and standards here in her environment of how a fight should be in order to attain measurable results  with some help of her Ni to envision a desirable outcome  Also  when she instantly divides her time to strive for efficiency in her last fight against the nine Mass Produced EVAs  Yes  she is very action oriented like we can observe from Se doms  but she doesn t use Se methods to stimulate herself with fun and new experiences in her enviroment  but use it to meet her dominant Te aims such as attaining aspired results and getting things done  just like Bakugou    Didn t you say you were going to punish him   Asuka s response to Misato when hugging Shinji while crying after he gets in danger  She is rejecting any emotional response from the external and even from herself because she still clings to what Misato has said earlier that she will grant him a punishment because of his  recklessness  and  foolishness   This information conforms to her external metrics  logical schema and standards of competency of how she believes that punishment should be granted on Shinji because of his impulsive act  Now let s discuss about her Fi ,entj
I don t see how she is a te dom,entj
Her Te is obvious that s okay  but where tf ESTJ voters see Si  Her Ni is more obvious imo  since she always has a very detailed plan whenever she step in the battle against Angels  she s complaining about her next step   what will I do now   and how will that affect in the futuristical events  Also  she seeks for absolute independence and freedom from the other people   she makes her own rules and her own system of living  she lives the live how she wants  without the rules  that s something Si dom aux would never do since the Si function is focused on rules  tradition  routine and categorizing ,entj
After a rewatch I m pretty sure Te Ni Se makes waaaay more sense than Te Si Ne for her,entj
No me parece que el instinto secundario de Asuka sea sx   Asuka nunca estuvo interesada en tener pareja por el tener pareja  establecer una conexi n emocional  etc   lo hac a meramente por  hacerse adulta  y con ello dar buena impresi n a los ojos del mundo  siendo esta pr cticamente un objeto para presumir  algo m s de so   que de sx     Tambi n destaco una cosa  y es que es tan poco sana que su tritype es abusivamente obvio ,entj
are very interesting all her functions are unhealthy  Te  she denies her sentimental side and cherishes to always be the best in everything she does  Ni  she imagines situations in the most ridiculous way possible and sees herself as an incredible person in a childish way which further reinforces the social  Se  when she s at the moment of a fight she risks even dumb just to prove she s good at what she does  Te Se loop  besides being very annoying and having a toxic personality because of that  Fi  she denies all of his sentimental side and ignores the feelings of others to support his incredible image  which clearly shows his Te Dom Fi inf along with  social  sees his sentimental side as an insult to his dominant Te  for me a perfect example of an unhealthy ENTJ  w ,entj
such an amazing character and an obvious ENTJ  she and toph are best girls ,entj
Very obvious te dom with how quick she figured out the system how she had this specific goal in mind and oriented towards that task instead of getting distracted strategizing and making a long term goal to have and finding the patterns to her goal  ni helping out te  how she has such an obvious inf fi she s just a textbook ENTJ  And while I do understand ENTJ why not a   gut fix instead of a   fix ,entj
Can someone please explain VLFE over VLEF  I m just learning about Attitudinal Psyche  but she seems more  E than  E to me  Insecure emotions  unconcerned physics ,entj
 My own mother thought I was a monster  She was right of course but it still hurt  SHE IS OBVIOUSLY ENTJ AND WHOEVER SAYS THE CONTRARY IS BLIND LOL,entj
She is clearly an ESFJ  Has   friends E   Senses things S   Cares about her fathers opinion F   Planned everything J ,entj
 My own mother thought I was a monster         She was right of course but it still hurt   ,entj
Those four XNFJ votes got some explaining to do ,entj
A very despicable antagonist but brilliantly written  The te dom fi inf is basically written all over and unlike her father she is more concrete instead of going into delusional thinking via tert ne of being the Phoenix King or sth her se gives her a much more grounded attitude to power more driven and relying on instinct like some predatory beast which indicates developed se instead a si ne axis imo and for all of her snobbery and vanity thats exactly what she is an uncivilised animal with a disregard for any established structure or tradition  That said her slow descent into madness how the facade broke more from episode to episode to her final clash with Zuko finally settling things with a triumph of his true heroism over her animalistic lust and megalominity and not only symbolizing a physical defeat but also a moral one was one of the best written arcs in one of the best shows I had right to experience when it aired ,entj
I definitely think her gut fix is    not    I think a lot of people are giving her an   fix based on the idea that she desires power  but I actually don t think this is true  Azula desires success  not power  That s why she s a    There are actually several instances where she actively gives up power in favor of plans that will help her succeed  When she takes Zuko back to the Fire Nation  that means she s not the heir apparent to the throne anymore  but she doesn t care about that  I think Azula s much more afraid of being imperfect than of having to rely on others  She has trouble genuinely trusting people  but she s able to use them to move her plans forward  Someone with an   fix would be more concerned with doing everything themselves  Azula only cares about this is she thinks they re being incompetent  or imperfect  Azula does everything to make sure that she is in line with the Fire Nation moral values  Many people mistake this as not caring about morality  but this isn t true  She cares deeply about the morality society has given her  and is always trying to be the perfect Fire Nation princess  She has an extreme level of perfectionism  which is directed primarily onto herself  Not only that  she represses her anger  just like she represses everything else  rather than using it as fuel the way someone with an   fix would do  This is a very long explanation  but I think she s definitely a     tritype  The Taskmaster  rather than      The Justice Fighter   Edit  Her being a social   makes her more open about her desire for achievement  which makes her LOOK like she has an   fix  but her openness about being competitive is not the same thing as how an   would deal with anger  Azula is much more prone to repress anger and channel it into perfecting herself  like someone with a   fix would do ,entj
One of my favorite antagonists ever,entj
insecure emotion     he seems pretty unbothered with it if you ask me  leaves  personal  matters up levi   hange,entj
I m sorry  but whoever voted ENFP for Erwin smith  I would like you to please step forward  wtf  ,entj
Can someone explain LSI ,entj
Bruhh  this site literally don t make any sense sometimes    How the heck is Erwin a VLEF  Tf     Here s how VLEFs are described     VLEFs are the most academic minded and argumentative out of all Attitudinal Psyche types  They make quick decisions about how to act  without questioning their decisions too much  This type is very curious about the world and is interested in the theoretical views of others  no matter how complex  Through expanding their mind  they find a logical path to their ambitions  always open to new ideas and theories  VLEFs refuse to feel any particular way until they are ready to do so  They can be extremely averse to those who apply emotional pressure to them  This type is skeptical of the strong emotions of other people  and will hide their own expressions if they don t feel safe in expressing them  VLEFs spend so much time in their motivated intellect that they overlook their own health from time to time  VLEFs appreciate anyone who decisively takes care of food  chores  and other practical tasks    Erwin s nothing like VLEFs  And the fact that there are    VLEF votes     On the other hand  this is how VFELs are described     VFEL is the Attitudinal Psyche type most motivated to enforce rules that make everyone s lives easier to manage  They are resourceful leaders that patiently teach others how to organize their environment so they are fit for success  This type can be uncomfortable with acting on their emotions and prefers to use willpower and practical skills to enforce their own stability  VFELs value their own time when accomplishing goals and they do not like to waste it on technicalities  They enjoy people who can concisely explain solutions while respecting the VFEL s emotional vulnerability  This type does not spend too much time in their own imagination because they believe taking action is a better way to make their aspirations a reality    Conclusion  Erwin is VFEL ,entj
Forgive me but I do not see him as LSI  He is ultimately consumed by his work and LSEs can be curious  intelligent types like Sherlock Holmes and Alan Turing and Data  Star Trek   Erwin constantly uses Te  examining information trying to extract the obvious answers from them but shying away from more abstract answers  while devising optimal strategies  etc   Watch this video of an actual socionics professional describing what an LSE is  https   www youtube com watch v YQWL qbqeyA,entj
Why isn t he a type    He s so consumed by his work that he almost doesn t have a life outside the Survey Corps  He s focused on efficiency and success  not on  being loved through being perfect   He manages to not care how others see him as a demon or as a bad person  as long as he succeeds and finds out the truth  He s a master at leadership and at arguing his position in a persuasive and inspiring way because he knows what soldiers need when going into battle  not because he lives by what he s saying  He s not for the survival of humanity as much as for his own selfish wish to find out if he  and his father  were right on the truth of their world  He s a gambler  a strategist and a great liar despite always being true to himself and his own values  Those are all characteristics of a type    not a type   ,entj
I am this man s dog and I believe he is      ENTJ so this my argumant   Extroverted Thinking  Te   What good respecting commander doesn t think solely on logic  His job depends on long term planning  and making sure there is the least amount of deaths possible  He needs to distance himself from his emotions to make the best possible plan of survival for everyone  But he also isn t naive to the inevitability of death  He can t waste his time on saving every single person  He knows that sacrifices are meant to be made  But at what point does the death stop  When his goal of the eradication of Titan s is achieved  He also knows that he will probably not see that happen in his life time  But that doesn t deter him  He also knows the best replacement for the role of Commander is the person who understands the Titan s best  Hanji  He has a goal in mind  and he will follow through with it  even after death    Introverted Intuition  Ni   He is extremely intelligent  That is a bit of a requirement for his job  But even before he became Commander  he could already guess things before it happens  He long knew Levi was there to kill him and steal documents before he even tried to do it  But he also knew that Levi would be a great asset and bring humanity that much closer to victory  When there is barely news of Eren s ability  he knew that Eren would be the key to defeating the Titan s  He knew that the basement Eren doesn t even remembers will be of great help in their mission  and makes it his biggest priority for the most part  He makes the connection of the government being involved with the Titan s pretty quickly  and knows that no progress will happen as long as the government suppresses humanity  And I haven t seen an occasion where he was wrong  Even when he had help identifying who the Female Titan is  he knew it had to be Annie after analyzing the evidence   Extroverted Sensing  Se   As Commander  he has to be aware of his environment  Just one second of ignorance can wipe out every single human  He has to know when to retreat  when to use Eren  and when more Titan s are coming  Out in the field  he quickly figures out that the Female Titan was calling Titans to come in to eat her  And knows that if the Scouting Legion stays  they will die  Erwin Smith can t afford to live in the past  and has to live in the moment to ensure the survival of his soldiers and humanity   Introverted Feeling  Fi   Now as this is his weakest function  you only get to see this a few times  And it doesn t help that it s INTROVERTED Felling  so he internalizes this more  And unfortunately you don t get the chance to see this in the anime  But in the manga   SPOILER ALERT  when Erwin nearly dies trying to save Eren from the Titan trio  and is recovering  he makes a remark about how he was bullied for being strange as a child  Not only that  but how says   How many hundreds of people do you think I ve fed to the Titans by now  One arm s hardly enough to make up for that  I ll pay off my debts in hell one day   He obviously feels the guilt of all his failed missions as Commander  After this  you see him and his old friend  Nile Dawk talking  you see that Erwin makes a reference that he actually had feelings for a girl in his Trainnee days  but gave it up for his vision to change the world  She later marries and bears children for Nile   Erwin Smith is not an emotionless sociopath  He is a human being that loves  regrets  and feels a great range of emotions  He just can t let it interfere with his vision for the world    RIP best character,entj
I am actually between ENTJ and ESTP    Can someone show me arguments that go against the ESTP idea  As everyone is already voting ENTJ  and no ESTP     I would like to debate it     Genuinely asking ,entj
how does he have Fi inferior   i see Te for sure  and Ni is extremely clear  thats also why i think hes an Ni dominant    like someone else said    every time he makes a plan  his subordinates call it a gamble and then it plays out exactly like he said    isn t this literally Ni over Te  his plans  the expeditions and his strategies  all of them are full of gambles and predictions just like this       When the truth of this world comes to light  I must be there to see it     Is that    so important  More so than your legs  More than the success of humanity    Yeah    this is also definitely not inferior Fi  a Te dominant probably wouldn t think this way  a Te dominant would prioritize winning efficiently and with as less of a risk as possible instead of prioritizing their own personal goal  their own personal wish ,entj
Listen to his speech  connecting the dots  can t get any more Ni than that  The man has lots of Se too ,entj
Why not ENTP who suffering from constant chronicle stressor so he appears like an xNTJ    His innovation through apple isn t just about efficiency like what Te dom would to think  His innovation through apple company revolutionize user experience in technology  not increasing the efficiency or other practical side about technology  His innovation really understand human centered perspective when make a satisfying user experience on apple design  this is really abstract and not an exact things to be measured like what Te dom wants to explore  Seems really Ne Ti Fe thinking proccess rather than Te Ni  Superficially we see him like an xNTJ but when we see how he think about technology and his visionary side  is really suit with how Ti Fe thinking proccess ,entj
In case of Te  I didn t see it  his innovative ideas and biography are solely Ti  the way he negotiated with other people to buy his computers would be Se aux over Ni  as his target was grounded but remained ambitious with it since he knew that he would have opened the modern era of computer although with such a minimum budget by using a typewriter and TV  helped by his dear friend  Steve Wozniak  So I would say it s not even Se inferior or tertiary when it comes to the short term plan  Very opportunistic and able to work outside the system  which defines what Ti actually is  His spiritual experience in India and his philosophy showed a strong Ti and Ni  He had a hippy state before been a Buddhist after back from his journey  His way of thinking was pretty abstract and by Jungian  Ti is described as the realm of logic whereas the picture is impressed by the abstraction in their own conceptual manner  given the way how he said that he has  no system   I believe this would lean Ti   Te  Inferior Fe was painfully obvious from the way he treated his family or when he had a pancreas ailment that would have costed his life forever or when he said  An apple for a day keeps the doctors away   I would have to say  unlike Bill  Steve cared more about the process rather than results  the reason why he built Apple from zero  paid by just    as a CEO and also resolved the problems which had been circumventing Apple for a long time after he had kicked out of the business  I remember that he had bought a Lucas Film production to create a science computer company  Nexx and he thought it d be a big success but no  he just walked under the egg shells with that company until he worked together with Bill Gates after back from his journey to raise his Apple company  Unlike Bill Gates who cared more about the results which is definitely a Te user but voted as INTP  Steve Jobs was more practical and very determined on the process  didn t care of how he gained his popularity and how Apple became one of the biggest technology industries until due  As an inferior Fe user  he cared more about his family and has the usual selfless attitude  would do anything for Apple and his family even though his life was the risk of his big gamble  He saw life as the gamble itself  which is why he wanted to bet on his every word with the usual courageous and striking statement and this is the opposite of Bill Gates who sees the world as the competition  so there s how we have had a gambler vs a competitor in the history of American industries which the story has been lasted ,entj
I think Steve Jobs isn t an ISTP  why  As an STP who works in computer fields  I can t stand not knowing everything which is going on  Wozniak said that Jobs didn t know tech at all  no hardware  no software  The only thing he cared about was his visions and to get things done  We STPs are not like that ,entj
Why sx so  I think he is sx sp or sp sx ,entj
He s really hard to type  but I see more Ni than Se  Se think in the present moment to be in tune with the environment  Ni is the opposite  think deeply  ignoring the material and thinking  what s up behind it  Steve jobs seems to be a Ni aux Se terc  moreover  ISTP voters can explain why Ti Te  for me ENTJ,entj
It s a complex typing  but to summarize everything into a few sentences   U don t know enough about what Apple was like if u voted ENTJ  His  ideal  was completely different from stereotyped te dom leadership  He might have several developed functions but there still exists focus that shapes his ideals   No  I ain t gonna make any more explanation  Either analyze it by urself using ti or question urself if u understand ti dom well enough if u don t have a developed ti ,entj
Very strong sense of individuality  eccentric and anti bureaucracy to be dominant Te  Very strong sense of concepts to be inferior Ni  Very strong awareness of details  beauty and quality to be inferior Si and Se  Very strong awareness of people emotions to be inferior Fe   Steve Jobs is just a exemple of how an high functional person can becomes and be ahead from functions stacks definitions  He s unique and extremely hard to works in just one type ,entj
Can someone explain why   ,entj
He really had a   in his tritype because of the way he wanted to get attention  I also consider that the combination of ESTP  w  is weird but it makes sense for Jobs  he definitely had a well developed INF NI  most of the publicity he did  it was very SE TI ,entj
Many people claim that INTJ voters are only using Letter typing  I will breakdown the cognitive functions and other ENTJ characters to compare Thomas Shelby to  To start  Michael Gray is an ENTJ  he is more confrontational and brash  He uses Te as dom  I believe he is more charming with women  whereas Tommy is more direct and blunt   Do you want to        Comparing TS to a clear ENTJ like Harvey Specter  it is evident that Michael and Harvey are more arrogant  A easy way to tell INTJ from ENTJ is ENTJs improve existing systems and INTJs create new ones  For example Tommy creates endless new opportunities for him and his family  And Michael wants to improve the existing drug trafficking industry with USA   INTJ Cognitive Functions  Ni Dom   What will be Te Aux   How to do it  Fi Ter   What I value as important  Se Inf   What is happening now   Tommy uses Ni dom to process info on people and his overall large plan  he wants to be a God  able to control everything  He uses Te Aux to organise people to achieve specific targets or opportunities getting him closer to his overall goal  His Fi Ter gives Tommy a moral compass  Obviously his sense of right and wrong is unorthodox but he knows that Mosley is bad and wants to stop him  If he had Fi Inf he would have no qualms being on Mosleys winning side  His Fi Ter differentiates him from Alfie  who has no morals and betrays everyone   At the end of season   Tommy is stuck in his head  Se Inf  unable to comprehend what went wrong  The present moment was overwhelming for him when his plan failed  In Season   Tommy acts more than previous seasons  doing more of ugly work  killings  that his brothers do  This unfamiliarity causes extreme stress and leads to overindulgence of sensory pleasures  alcohol and sex  to cope with it   To conclude  INTJs can act as well as think so long as the plan requires it  For example Tommy realises Arthur can t lead his family into success so he takes charge instead of his previous background work  Or he acts in his own plans if there is sensitive info and he needs the job done right  One more small thing  when Tommy walks  his eyes are down  thinking and processing info  instead of the classic ENTJ strut  Tommy  like INTJs  is careful and cautious with what he says  only saying the bare minimum and speaking in short sentences with pauses   I have seen glimpses of an ENTJ Tommy is season   but I hope season   will show us once and for all ,entj
Why melancholic choleric  He is definately choleric melancholic  please change that      vote,entj
People do realize that ENTJs are one of the most introverted extrovert types right  Besides that he deals with past trauma  something that cannot be easily dealt with  Function wise there is literally no way this man can be Ni Fi  He prides himself on the work he does and is not afraid to be in the center of it ,entj
How do yall explain the Se grips I wonder  Fi at third position would easily explain his complicated relationship with his introspection  I still think his dominant function is and always has been Ni ,entj
ok   ENTJ  are u guys sure ,entj

I understand why he comes off as an ENTJ  but I m thinking INTJ is more fitting  Highly successful people are always hard to type  as they tend to have a lot of things figured out for themselves  that would usually give their type away more clearly  He knows how to use his Te  that s for sure  but I think the Ni is a bit more active in him  as he is constantly thinking and seems to have a plan for almost everything ,entj
No one seems to realize that tommy has ptsd Before the war  he was described as sentimental  charming  funny and idealistic But after the war turned cold and calculating  there is so much stereotypes based typing and intuitive bias Tommy seemed to be as caring  loving charming and sensitive as only an ISFJ would  following tradition and having a protective feeling towards his family and loved ones But after the war  he seemed to polarize his behavior to an INTJ,entj
Why bother arguing anymore  INTJ voters are consistently delusional across all threads involving  mysterious badass cool character   They unironically consider themselves to be the ultimate  cool   badass  guy hence the mass hysteria going around voting every characters in sight to be INTJ and I am getting tired of explaining to them for the hundredths of time that  thinking about future once doesn t make a character Ni dom  ,entj
Ok hold up  he is that ENTJ that confuses you to believe he is an INTJ  I mean there is not anything wrong with being confused and being in love with him  right ENFP ,entj
ti se  I REPEAT  TI SE ,entj
I dunno   either INFJ or INTJ they re my fav type  I m so jealoused of them  because they re way smarter and way more brilliant than I am  they are perfect ,entj
As much as I want this enneagram type  I envy it myself ,entj
I envy no one  gigachad ,entj
I envy their confidence and their natural kindness  Edit  Also  why would anyone in their right mind envy an    I mean no offense to  s  but most people hate them so why would you want to be one ,entj
ENTP  but I love myself to much HAHAHAHAHA,entj
Te Ni ,entj
Yes ,entj
What s to envy in a type  Are you sure you envy the type and not the stereotype  Don t answer  it was rethorical ,entj
 Even I m jealous ,entj
I m sorry but Rick is a clear Ni dom with a Te aux  no discussion  Btw we can also perceive his Fi ter in the show since he often has these personnal rules that he never breaks  He s an INTJ  and as an ENTP i can clearly tell he s not one of us  He never ever uses Fe and it s clear that he uses Ni and not Ne like come on  INTJ it is  Also  such a pessimist can t wing with type    he s definitely a  w  for me  he s reluctant and analytical ,entp
ENTP why   Deceiving  plotting as a whole Seeing and understanding others but not giving knowledge As a consequence of Ne s manipulation of the information and retaliation  Rick plans to defeat everyone and preliminary assessment of whether he can win  He is indifferent to the world Because he sees that all is nothing and decides only because he receives information and decides which information to trust  which Ne ti does not block his thinking no matter what anyone says  He will listen and reply with jokes  In which the feeling of impact is very strong by Ne to make clear in the information that surrounds   I don t want to be stereotypical  but I still say that INTP is different from ENTP  The main thing is proof  What Rick did was not only proving to be true  achievable  but building on a variety of ideas  Knowledge is a tool that enhances imagination  Rick s solution was to look at the big picture to find the bad points  Which I think is a clear Ne ,entp
I always thought he was an INTP  but after looking into it a bit more ENTP could fit as well  But eh  what do I know   PS  Isn t it interesting that majority of INTP s on here voted him as an INTP   At least as far as I was bothered to look  ,entp
rick is an ENTP by far  His Si is so damn low he doesn t care about routine  stability  or idk being or act like a normal person  his Fe is higher than INTPs he can t be an INTP  he adapta well to people in many situations  he uses his Fe in an unhealthy an manipulative way ,entp
Can someone explain rick being ENTP or  w  no one has done that  which is weird,entp
Why are all these ENTPs villain like characters ,entp
Rick has so little Si it s incredible  he cares so little for stability it s insane    Even as an Si inferior myself  he s still crazy  ,entp
                                  INTP                                                                           ,entp
Rick  in the first two seasons  is way more ENTP  w  than season three and beyond  At this point in the show  he s an INTP   Rick is not nearly as open to new ideas as you guys like to think  showing how he leads with a very developed Ti  If Morty offers an idea that Rick doesn t consider logical  he shuts it down immediately  like when they teleported down to the microverse battery  An ENTP Rick would entertain these alternative ideas a lot more than the INTP Rick we have now  As for his Enneagram  his tritype is  w   w   w  sx sp ,entp
people keep asking  what s an argument for ISTP  so i m just going to move them all to the top here so they re easier to see  not all of these are mine btw im crediting ppl  CREDITS TO USER  OF   I ll be explaining my views on why I think Karma s an ISTP  I believe I focused more on the Se Ni axis on my previous comments instead of Ti Fe so I ll go over them in depth here  I ve had this saved up for   months now so I felt like commenting   Dominant Ti  Karma uses deductive logic to analyze problems and figure out their solutions accordingly with his own subjective understandings  During the pool incident  Karma was able to deduce that Itona would be weak to the detergent that Terasaka had sprayed on the class  since Korosensei is vulnerable to that detergent and they both share the same weaknesses due to having tentacles  He deduced this by taking realistic observations of the scent on Terasaka s shirt and Korosensei s weaknesses to water and the detergent Ti Se    The final exam showcases   Karma analyzes the underlying theory behind the problem  deducing that the atomic crystal has lattice structure with identical atoms since it has identical cubes bordering it  He notes that there are atoms at the vertices which are also a part of bordering cubes  and a central atom A     which is equidistant from the other atoms  With a single vertex surrounded by identical cubes on all sides  an atom would have equal portions in at least   cubes  i e  a vertex atom would have    th its volume in one cube and since there are atoms at all   vertices  their total volume would be exactly that of one atom  A    also occupies an area of one atom  since all atoms in lattice structure are identical  Karma deduces that the volume of A    is  a      half of a cube   There are also various instances of Karma analyzing external structures through his own personal understandings that allows him to form plans in response  In the baseball game  He uses the opportunity of the opposing team cheating to form a closed off defensive position in order to obstruct their view which would be called as cheating but since the other team was allowed they d have to allow him as well Ti   analyzing the rules of the game and explaining his actions as logically consistent to them    Another example would be when he told Korosensei that he was aware that Bureaucrats secretly manage the country and implement plans  deducing this from the fact that the country kept functioning even when the politicians were useless seeing beneath the surface that civil servants hold powerful positions from the shadows in future situations Ti Ni  In the final mission  Karma analysed the entire mapping of   E s mountain including the logistics and locations which he used to devise logical plans  He was able to understand the technology required for reconnaissance and the traps formed by his classmates to use against the mercenaries which would immobilize them and create an opening for a surprise attack Ti  Se and Ti   Se     Korosensei noted this about Karma s fighting style in both the sub and the dub which I think solidifies Ti  Se  i ve paraphrased them here    Karma is a combat assassin that values the process  bargaining  strategy  how to defeat your foe  then comes his assassination  sub    Only once he has  analyzed  their moves does he deal the decisive blow  dub    Karma s approach in the term  exam is also very Ti  simplifying problems down to basic essentials yet still expanding his knowledge  which is why he was able to remain undaunted in the face of new syllabus   Auxiliary Se  In his fight with Grip  Karma was able to react quickly enough to dodge alo his attacks  and was able to recall and replicate Karasuma s moves in order to counterattack  the latter noting Karma s attention to details and adaptability  He was also able to adapt to the circumstances by holding his breath and spraying him when his back was turned   In the Civil war arc  Karma s Se is constantly picking up on details in the environment for his Ti to model  He was able to model Hayami s movements using realistic observations  noting that she had great kinetic vision  though she has less range and accuracy Ti Se   hence she d be useful in an active battle field  He notices Mimura s demeanour and producer s eye for the field for reconnaissance Ti Se  which proved to be very resourceful  Lastly in his fight with Nagisa  he observes the hilt on his leg  models his fighting techniques by taking his hits and adapts to them accordingly to take him down Ti Se    more in replies ,entp

anyone have any arguements for SCOEI SCUEI  he seems too nonchalant and aloof to be xxOxx over xxUxx in my opinion but i d like to hear peoples thoughts,entp
His Ne function seemingly dominates his overall personality  Not to mention  he bought an intire squid in order to make his teacher mad  When he fought against grip  he used a lot of tactics to fight against him  His ideas are too wild that nobody could basically think about them  For his Si  he used his own experiences to improve himself   Bad English like seriously ,entp
can someone explain why he s typed ILE  ,entp
how is he sanguine   melancholic   to be fair i don t see much of either for him but he has VERY few sanguine traits  so i m leaning more towards melancholic,entp
I m going to make a statement about his IV stack  right now I m leaning more on bojack being sp dom but i could see sx dom  what I do know he is so blind   s with the social instinct find personal value in relations and belonging   s with the self preservation instinct find personal value in accomplishments  lifestyle  and career  and  s with the sexual instinct find personal value in desirability and displays of attractiveness  Bojack reads more as sp and sx  I think he fails a lot at the social instinct  because it isn t where his concerns lie    for self pres  he wants to show his value through the life and career he builds  putting so much of his sense of self worth into whether or not a project he s in is successful and makes him look good  he displays all of his past accomplishments to prove that he has value  tries to achieve without considering how his actions may be affecting or hurting others  he often cuts corners  also uses materialism to show off his success    for sexual  he wants to be captivating  when he s in a relationship he can  if only for a moment  morph his outward personality to whatever his partner wants  until at some point  they get to know that that is not actually who he is and it was a display created to attract them  has a tendency to try to disappear behind his performance  and he rejects people when they get to know the real bojack  he wants to be considered desirable    for why he fails at social  he does not care to be seen as a good role model  he does not care about others potential  he his so bad at maintaining and watching after his social reputation  lacking in social charm  the way he builds relationships is less so like and more sx like  as he does it through trying to be magnetic rather than finding commonality like people with high social instinct would  social  s get caught up in following paths that others set for them or what others want  but bojack didnt  bojack knew he wanted to be famous to achieve value  nobody told him that he should act or do comedy  he is also too outwardly critical of the social realm to be a social dominant  his social blindness is indicative of a lot of bojack s problems     source for this is the book  the instinctual drives and the enneagram  ,entp
He s so hard to type  i d say he s a  w  but   also seems pretty accurate to me too  Sure  he likes attention  is ambitious and has succeeded in his achievement of fame  But is this who he really is or is this what he actively pursues bc of his childhood trauma  Him being famous is pretty much rooted in his mom telling him he better do something great  to compensate for him being a burden   Even when he became famous his mother was still dissatisfied  and after all this negative  and only negative  attention he was given as a child  who wouldn t actively pursue positive attention from others  I feel his   ness is very much rooted in trauma  but does anyone have an argument for him being a   bc of his nature and essence  For the ones saying he s a    i think he s not  A   often dwells in their negative emotions  unlike Bojack who is constantly distracting himself from his emotions as long as he can until it s all too much for him  He often rationalizes and avoids emotions  using external stuff such as drugs and partying  I might be biased  but that seems to me pretty much like something a   would do  He can also seem cold and distant when dealing with other persons emotions  again  more a   behavior than a   s   But is this him being a   or him just being unhealthy  I think both  but i also think it s a good enough argument to discard   as his type  So i ll stay with   for now but i ll read more comments and see what y all think about this ,entp
whats ur guys  fav episode and why ,entp
stupid horse man         ,entp
Honestly thrown off by the sheer amount of Choleric   Sanguine votes here  He may have starred in a family comedy and acts as the main character of a comedy show himself  although the genre is debatable at times   but that s just how the show is written   Bojack himself is EASILY one of the most nihilistic and miserable characters on the show  He likes to make jokes and enjoys plenty of cheap thrills in his spare time  but there is not a single drop of sanguine in this guy besides that  Pretty easy Choleric   Melancholic typing confused by the nature of the show if you ask me     ,entp
I don t know what this man s enneagram is  He s so goddamn mentally unhealthy  it s near impossible to figure out  I do know that I relate to him way too much  But ANYWAY   Something to factor into this is that he probably has borderline personality disorder  I wrote an analysis on that at one point  although I think I lost it  but he has all nine of the traits of BPD  and you only need five to be diagnosed  And one of the traits of BPD is impulsive behavior  such as binging on food  alcohol  or drugs    Additionally  he is an Ne dom and seems to have ADHD  which also factors into his high degree of impulsivity    Also  I think we can all agree he s depressed to some degree  which can make it difficult for people to work toward their goals and prevent them from feeling fulfillment at achievements   So when people use his impulsive behavior to call him an enneagram    or say that being unmotivated to improve his social standing or not feeling worthwhile when he gets an award makes him not a    please also remember that there are a few other factors that could also be causing this   Finally  I d be willing to explain why I think he has BPD and ADHD in the replies if anyone wants to hear an argument for it   EDIT  my arguments for both are in the replies ,entp

Hello Barack  My favorite ENTP freind    How are doing   Bests  Joey  ,entp
He seems like a Ni dom with high Fe,entp
A lot of political commentary books I ve read suggest he s seen as somewhat cold and boorish behind closed doors  This means he probably has Fe  enough to cultivate a warmer persona for the press  but not enough to be an Fe dom  So  we re looking for an extravert with Fe  but not dom Fe  so tertiary Fe  I doubt he s an S  so ENTP   I wouldn t personally call ENTPs boorish  but from an S perspective  it s possible he could be seen that way if he s riffing on theory all the time    The ENTPs I know are passionate when talking about their many research interests  hobbies etc  so much so that people they can accidentally lose people who don t share the same interests ,entp
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,entp
It s official  Barack Obama s Tritype with the incorporation of Wings is  w   w   w  ,entp
EIE  as the majority here already seem to believe  For DCNH subtype  it seems that Obama would be D subtype due to his job as president  but I believe that there s a clear initial aspect to him  DC does not seem likely  he seems less like the trailblazer EIE DC  like Hitler  and more likely is a DH   the compromise leader subtype  So the DH subtype of EIE seems very likely  No clear accentuations  and absolutely no sign of an AO shift ,entp
 My goals mostly involved maintaining normalcy and stability  but those would never be Barack s  We d grown better about recognizing this and letting is be  One yin  one yang  I craved routine and order  and he did not  He could live in the ocean  I needed the boat     Michelle Obama   Becoming   This quote seems so indicative of her Si Te comfortably managing with his Ne Ti ,entp
Not pragmatic and always appeals to morals through the use of universal values  If you think he s ENTP you are probably mistyped yourself and have no idea what Ne is ,entp
Notice how     of ENFJ comments lack an enneagram vote   And I don t really blame them  When I only knew about MBTI  I tried linking everything to it  But there are many more factors at play  including enneagram ,entp
so uhhh  what s with those ISFJ votes rising suddenly ,entp
He wear a mask which make it difficult to see his actual  true self  He wanted to save everyone but he didn t want anyone to find out about his motives  because that would destroy the image he created  He kind of remind me of Celestia Ludenberg ,entp
i understand why he s ENTP but can someone explain his Fe to me ,entp
guys wouldnt it be funny if kokichi ouma was a  LIE   eh get it because thats his sweet catchphrase  I think it would be pretty funny,entp

It s been a while since i last played the game but why is he  w  over  w   Since he is    ,entp
What would guys type pre game Kokichi ,entp
he is absolutely an eie  and i m pretty confused why people type him ile   his primary concern  the entire game  is with people  understanding people and manipulating them  reacting to them in the current moment  influencing their emotions  garnering reactions  etc  this is his interest way before anything else  and these are characteristics of fe base   he isn t intimidated or offset by the domain of fi like an ile  he just doesn t care about them  like an eie doesn t ,entp
okay guys who s ready to fix his IV    ,entp
What s with all these ISFJ votes  You call whatever this man has a healthy use of Fe  Or are these votes all Kokichi s    banned fake accounts   j  Honestly  as an ENTP myself  some of the things he says feel like something I d say  Stereotypes  stereotypes  sure  but I just feel the tert Fe on a spiritual level ,entp
People are between INFJ and ENTP  but I don t think arguments pointing out how good he is at deceiving reading others will do much  esp since both ENTP and INFJ voters have used it   Both Fe Ti and Ti Fe types are known to be good at playing people without being played themselves  because they balance absorbing emotions and reading people s intentions with trusting their reasoning and keeping their stories logically coherent   So maybe focusing on whether he has Ne dom Si inf or Ni dom Se inf will help more ,entp
I definitely see more ni in him than ne  yes he has ne tendencies like being nosy  and he tends to be very driven by curiosity  etc  How dominant or fe as the secondary function seems too far fetched to me  because he is always seen to use auxiliary fe in a very unhealthy way  rather than dominant or secondary fe  He could be an e tp  or an INFJ  but dominant fe seems a bit too far fetched  However for him to be ESTP  I dont see inferior ni at all  I do see inferior si in him because of how he doesnt do things as how it should be done  which jean  a dominant si user disapproves   and how he doesnt acknowledge his past and thinks he took a clean break from it  I m going to go with ENTP for now  but honestly  to come to a conclusion  we really need to see more of him  Which I m sure we would in the khaenriah chapter ,entp
 Kaeya enjoys putting people into high stress situations and challenging their values  which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike    This Is Fe Ti ax there  Fe  Kaeya absorbs other people values and emotions and Is interested in them  Ti  Kaeaya questions and debunk people s own values with Logic   This Is what Johan Liebert from Monster does  an INFJ  Kaeaya being ENTP is the biggest mistype in this site ,entp
kaeya  w   w  waiting room  people mischaracterise him so much it s scary,entp
Does anyone want to explain EIE and  E  What   Or  F  Just generally  this is a VERY weird AP and socionics combination  EVLF or EVFL is most likely for EIEs so this is a bit of a shocker to be FLVE   not that  V is necessarily contradictory but that s the only part that COULD work ,entp
my favourite character in this game  and main  but I m putting off typing his enneagram because I don t think we have enough information on his core yet    I m guessing mostly either   or   but I am not sure of it yet  hope we get to hear more of his background    sigh     my mysterious dreamboat    love you,entp
A lot of Ne and I love it,entp
I see that people are still really struggling to type his enneagram  I think if people were more familiar with what ENTP  w s are like he d be one of the easiest to type  The contradictory behaviour is the biggest give away it s a sign of type more than anything ,entp
Ni dom  Keaya showed his Ni function during secondary missions  Keaya could clearly predict and see the general painting of the actions of the other characters  He never displayed Ne  since in the webcomic we can see him linking informations to get the big picture of what was happening after Collei entered the city  he also used Ni when stuff about Diluc s father came out and said his general considerations to Diluc  Fe  we can clearly see his Fe since he makes totally fun of Fi  Kaeya enjoys putting people into high stress situations and challenging their values  which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike  He doesn t have internal values  according to him   Justice is not an absolute principle  but is the result of striking that fine balance between strength and strategy  As for the details of how it s done    Don t worry yourself too much about that   Ti  he showed several times in the game that a thing should first make sense to him or he won t act  he does never trust other sources and he makes sure that something does make sense with his internal theory first  Inferior Se  he usually does the others do his job ,entp
I think the reason why she s seen as a Se user is because of her apathy  I understand it now  and it is quite hard to type a  w   But I see Ne dominant now  not Fi and not Ti either  I don t think she s a head type at all  She s very present oriented  She may not be aware of what is going on  but wouldn t a  w  be a little more energetic than she is  The gluttony would manifest in her wanting to get the most out of a situation  and the w  would even emphasize this  but that s not what happens  She is just there  trying to not make any difference  not expressing fear of what could happen to her  not trying to involve herself in the situation    Of course  she must have some psychological problems  but I don t see how this behavior implies that she s a    Being an ENTP  w  makes much more sense  And honestly  being a Ne dom  w  whose mental healthy has been awful for almost ten years  seeing her imagining some future scenarios for someone else and not for herself feels painfully familiar   ,entp
her quarrels with the priest and her mocking his prayers is the most ENTP thing ever  hj  but yeah  her final conversation with Sae byeok about what their lives would be like if they escaped the game shows some clear Ne possibility exploring  and her ultimate decision that Sae byeok should live  given that Sae byeok has something to live for and she doesn t  shows her Ti and Fe,entp
the fact she kept talking about future plans with Kang Sae Byeok when one was about to die totally forgetting about it and Kang Sae Byeok was like    girl   and she went  oh right i forgot   SI INFERIOR LOL,entp
 Kang Sae Byeok  Thanks for playing with me ,entp
She s an ENTP all the way through   Ne Ti  She is very cynical and critical of people s opinions  not shying away from expressing her harsh but honest remarks  Her Ne handles her cynical assertions in a more playful and lowkey annoying way to show people s hypocrisies around her  most notably with her interactions with the pastor  This Ne Ti combo gave her dominant attitude in conversations as opposed to Se doms who would ve been more engaged in engaging in the world with actions  think of Doksu and the crazy woman     Tert Fe  She is good at reading the room and group dynamics but her pride prevents her from dealing with the group with her head down like she knows she s expected to as a girl in the game  Instead  when she sensed people did not like her presence in the    people groupings  she volunteered to leave despite knowing that doing so may put her at risk  She handles the Inferior Fe Sae byeok at the end by leading her into a very Ne driven conversation  She can read people s intentions and motivations around her  She knows how to read people  She is just above doing desperate acts even on the brink of death    Inferior Si  Her inner turmoil seems to have stemmed from her past experiences rooted in her memories that she couldn t let go of  This is evident in her continued disdain towards religion because of what her father did  She doesn t seem to have any responsibilities as well outside the game  confessing she wouldn t know how to spend the money even if would win it  She is not even responsible with her own well being  easily giving her own life for someone she just met ,entp
i understand alpha irrational but why ILE   SEI ,entp
I m actually voting INFJ with PTSD from the intense trauma of her life s events  which I think could make her seem more Ne then Ni  but she seems to have a lack of sense of self and sacrifices herself  She doesn t seem to debate really  She was annoyed by the guy who kept using his faith audible  but Jesus INFJ  flipped tables when he felt people were practicing religion wrong too  One can argue INFJ may carry a higher moral standard others sometimes can t reach in the spiritual humanist arena  Though we think the world could be a better place if they did ,entp

  months ago  I asked if it was weird for an Ni user to have ADHD  I mentioned that I might have checked almost every box for inattentive ADHD after a few years of research  and how that was chucked out the window the first time I tried to mention it  Well  it turned out I was right this whole time and received the diagnosis after years of waiting    Finally  after wearing that mask for so long  somebody saw right through me for the first time  And because of that  I m officially in the ADHD club  I m curious to see how that affects my personality type though  because maybe there s an underlying reason behind why I wasn t diagnosed in childhood ,entp
ion think i have adhd  im actually glad i dont  sounds like a PAIN,entp
Just gonna leave this here   https   practicaltyping com            the umbrella academy klaus hargreeves ENTP ,entp
Nah he s not ENTP  Everyone  even ENTP voters admit he has no ti  so WHY would he be ENTP    And as for fe  where is that  When does he ever try to accommodate others  adhere to their expectations  or read them easily  He disobeys expectations and almost prides himself on being controversial and degenerate  He only focusses on his own feelings  for example  when he lied about Ben not being here in s    Yes  ENTPs can be selfish and insensitive  but when they disregard other s feelings  they do not do so to focus on their own like fi users  No  he doesn t have morals  but fi isn t morals  Fi is being led by internal emotional impulses  and that is literally all this guy is led by  Fi is viewing your feelings as truth  causing fi users to often have a self righteousness to them  Klaus has this  like when he  completely unaware of how socially shocking such a display of homosexuality was in the time period and in public  tries to pull Dave out of the closet because KLAUS thinks it is best for him  He doesn t even consider how Dave feels and how the others react   He also vents about his feelings very often to people who really don t care  ENTPs are uncomfortable expressing feelings  and even with high fe  they try to express shared  relatable feelings to put others at ease or influence the emotional atmosphere  Klaus just does it because he wants to express himself  regardless of the effect on others  He just does what he feels whenever he feels  regardless of logic and other people s feelings  He has no te but why would he   inf functions are low  He does go to extreme measures to get what he wants sometimes tho  like the snowglobe scene   And nope  NOPPE  the cult is not an example of fe  He literally hates it because so much social interaction exhausts him and limits his emotional freedom  He s not even convincing  his cult members are just cartoonishly deluded drooling babies honestly  He abandons the cult anyway  so clearly he didn t even enjoy the social unity  Provide a specific example of how the cult is fe or you re just waffling  ENFPs can be cult leaders too  Exhibit A  Charles Manson ,entp
I m voting ENTP but I am      sure he is ENFP in Season    even watching a compilation of his funny moments from the mixture of both seasons the difference shows so much,entp
Now I think he ultimately is an ENTP  but the character is not consistently an ENTP     ok his Fe is consistent that is always there  But Ne   Se is the problem   He suffers from the Se Ne funny character problem  His motivations and or actions seem motivated by Se  Often living in the moment  not looking at the possibilities and sometimes getting on that Ni grip tunnel vission  You rarely if ever see him excited about future possibilities  if anything it is his biggest flaw   But he is played by an Ne dom actor  who is very funny so he is given free reign to improvise and be as witty as he can  So all his dialogue comes across as an Ne dom   Which you end up with a character that acts like an unhealthy Se dom  but talks like an Ne dom  It is quite common   So if you analyze his motivations and actions without hearing a single word he says  one would be convinced he is an unhealthy Se dom  But if one analyzes just what he says  without taking into account what he does  he is without a doubt an Ne dom   Ultimately they ended up with a great character  because it was done right  for the most part  But for typing it can end up being confusing  But such things can happen with fictional characters ,entp
I was going to vote ENTP too but can someone explain why Ne Se ,entp
 I have this weird self esteem issue where I hate myself but still think that I m better than everyone else  that sums it up pretty well ,entp
Funny to me how this grandiose weirdo cult leader character has been mostly typed ESE  while the soft spoken  cozy sweater boy Harry Styles has mostly been typed EIE on this site lol,entp
Can someone explain how he uses Thinking  This dude feels more than anyone in that family,entp
 How many more rock bottoms are you gonna have to hit before you start taking care of yourself     Ben   Si polr,entp
openpsychometrics said that i m     similar to him  and honestly  i don t know if i should be happy or scared about it ,entp
issok guys ENTP s are just better at practicing narciss  i mean healthy self love  hence why we vote for ourselves B ,entp
Ni doms aux are awesome in general  I think if I were to ever befriend one I d be irritated by how they make no absolute sense  Making guesses solely based on your intuition     and being correct     I wonder  are you related to aliens by chance  Idk ,entp
chads ,entp
Best type ,entp
Contrary to popular opinion  I actually love INFPs so much  Also  Ti users suck  Looking at you  ENTP and INTP ,entp
se dom solos,entp
ALWAYS THE ENTPS VOTING FOR THEMSELVES  ,entp
it s always the ENTPs voting for themselves  ,entp
ENTPs y all get so much love already  vote a type other than yourself  Thank you,entp
Still patiently waiting for an ENFP to adopt me and take me on adventures ,entp
MADRE MIA no sere yo aqui kuroo but irl,entp
I         love Kuroo but I think you put too much  chill  in his character he s not  w   He s competitive and likes to annoy and mess with people  You can clearly see it when he invited tsukishima to train with him an Bokuto  he made him  angry  just to train with him   Shows his    and his  goofier  behaviour  the little yay when he scored or the chaotic laugh  shows us that he s obviously a  w   Not laughing all the time or being serious doesn t mean his wing is    Him being a ENTP  w  makes so much sense pls don t vote  w   And him not being as  aggressive  as atsumu is not a good argument  not being stereotypical doesn t make him less  w   ,entp
ok although he may be a social   that doesn t change the  s fixations  They are still the same old aggressive  s  Just nicer and like appearing more vulnerable to their inner trusted circle  That doesn t change the type itself  Still  s  Still aggressive  When combined with SLE this is a very intense combination that Kuroo doesn t fit very much  Look at Miya Atsumu he s an SEE     and he s very intense and competitive  Kuroo on the other hand is very chill and outgoing which hints more so towards   wing  IVs don t change a types fixations only their behaviours ,entp
y all gotta do your research on social  s  as a social    I ll shove information about them down people s throats if I have to  so as to avoid continual mistype after mistype lol  here s the best source I have found for enneagram in general   http   www russellrowe com enneagram types enneagram type   description pdf  click on the  subtypes  link and read the social   typing  which suits Kuroo very well  I personally have no takes on his type beyond wanting to casually mention to either side      w  voters  don t forget that he has a   fix  so an  w  SLE with a   fix will likely be far more aggressive than that  Although  I also see more  w  attributes than  w   so potentially fix the tritype  since I could also see a   fix     w  voters  read up more on social  s  because as a social  w   even with the   wing  we re really not all THAT aggressive given our IVs  But then again  given he s an SLE  who knows  He s also calm over limbic  so he naturally won t be as aggressive as other  w s   for either side  why not consider a   fix  it would make sense with his ability to soak up information like a sponge and spit it back out at people in a display of intellectual dominance    fix supporting   core     but I m not partial to any one typing  just food for thought  I suppose ,entp
can anyone explain the wing arguments  i can see both w  and w  but i want someone to explain it to me,entp
honestly i think kuroo is classifiable as  w  compared to  w    w s are active people  who would prefer to choose freedom rather than peace  and also thinking about the fact that kuroo is a scorpio  a characteristic of scorpions is precisely this temperament ,entp
personally I see kuroo as an ENTJ I don t see Ne anywhere but rather I see Te because of the way he leads his team I don t see so much chaos in him,entp
initially i saw it as an  w   but upon reviewing some comments and researching further into the   variants  i see that most of the arguments presented for w  can be easily explained with your social instinct   and he is also very healthy  i see that many people here compare it to atsumu  which in my view is a mistake  because even characters with the same types can be different,entp
Everyone who says he s w  over w  needs to do their homework and read about so  ,entp
Y all are always saying that s he s so chill and mature despite being E  so why isn t it w    w   I feel like his w  tendencies are stronger ,entp
In my worst I m a toxic empath lol,entp
I think I m Ni lead but tend to somewhat frequently use both kinds of socionics Intuition with the ease of an ambidextrous person using both their right and left hands to write  pretty sure I got Fi and Te sandwiched in my stacking though  so this got me wondering for a while whether I was ENFP or INTP  ILI    It seems like a lot of  gen z  internet meme culture is really random and uninhibited like Ne  so I guess a lot of people tend to have an ENXP online persona,entp
Yes  I can be heaty sometimes ,entp
uh ,entp
Sincerely am guilty for this because of my strangely abundant Ne and the Fe Ti axis  Makes me wonder how much do other INFJs act like ENTPs in this happening ,entp
I m the same type and enneagram that is most voted today on this thread   but sometimes I act like an ISTJ  w    Normally when I m very tired ,entp
I frequently consider the possibility of being a Ti user   ,entp
me when mental health good,entp
I m literally an ESFJ in my mind but how I act and all my decision making is literally ENTP,entp
only around strangers does my Se ever seem to function    ,entp
I ve seen people trying to take out obvious ENTP characters like Chandler  Tony Stark  Hisoka  Jack Sparrow     But I never thought some people would try to take away even the most obvious of them all  the Joker   I mean  what the hell  the guy is literally       Ne Ti   Everything about The Joker involves breaking the status quo  breaking traditions  breaking well preserved things and turning everything upside down as all sorts of random ideas come to his mind   His pleasure is not in physical sensations through   senses  but in playing with people s psych through his way of thinking and interpreting the world  Se is not even in question   His business is not following plans or reaching targets  his business is to clutter everything and make it flow like unpredictable ramifications   He is the walking stereotype of the villainous ENTP  wreaking havoc with his restless mind spurting random ideas into the air while playing with people s minds with his own logic  Pure Ne Ti ,entp
A perfect example of ENTP possesed by INTJ shadow  ,entp
Occam s razor says ENTP  After all he claims to be a dog chasing cars  Well   can you trust anything he says   This is why the ENTJ votes are somewhat compelling  There could be an argument made that his whole persona is just an act which mocks chaos   The same way Bane mocked the idea of hope ,entp
There is no way this character is not    J  his figure is totally based on the ENTP archetype  however  he is obsessively controlling and planning  The movie plays precisely with that    he always says he doesn t make plans but his actions show the opposite of that   And honestly  I think he s more Ni Ne  He intuits everything Harvey and Batman are going to do and with that manipulates the whole situation  he manages to intuit the kidnapping of Hong Kong and take advantage of it before the act happens   The joker in this movie is almost an omnipresent and omniscient demonic entity  and that s precisely because of his planning for everything   I saw some possibilities between INFJ and ENTJ here in the comments and I found it interesting ,entp
Absolutely ZERO Ne and I watched the movie like three times  Probably ESTP or ENxJ  ISTP too possibly  Even xSFP works to some extent ,entp
Why VFLE  I don t necessarily disagree  but I don t really get why his Logic would be insecure  he seems pretty confident with his sense of logic  Plus   L types will pester others with logical questions and play devil s advocate when unhealthy  which pretty accurately describes this version of the Joker   F doesn t make any sense to me either,entp
Why insecure Logic  Insecure Emotion makes way more sense ,entp
Obviously he s not exactly functioning the same way a normal human being would  but I d say Calm over Limbic in SLOAN  but he s generally calm  calculated  and doesn t sway from his goal  as much as we might want to associate said goal with  Limbic  behaviour  That s not my understanding of it  That s why I ve voted SCUEI   Comic Joker is still a SLUEI  though ,entp
The fact he is voted ILE blows my mind   Extremely expressive  theatrical  flamboyant to the max  ideologically driven and focused on delivering his message  the guy has literally zero Si  no care for comfortable   no care for pain   nothing   And really  Alpha Quadra   Alphas are focused on lighthearted  easy going and COMFORTABLE enviroment  they want to focus on POSITIVE emotionality and don t want to disrupt positive enviroment  they are of the belief that everyone is equal and we should let people to their devices   This has nothing in common with Joker  he was ideologically driven person who had a clear vision of what the world was and how it operated  he wanted to shake things up and bring change  he believed people deep down were pretty immoral individuals who would hurt one another once  pushed  to it  he went about his goals in aggressive fashion and wasn t afraid to use force at all    Beta quadra   You people clearly have no clue what ILEs are like or what Alpha quadra is like  go educate yourselves ,entp
  Si Polr    F in Attitudinal psyche   Isn t VLEF better fit or how is it possible that he has  F  he doesn t care about AP Physics at all ,entp
all that really happens is that I become more extraverted and more argumentative,entp
i pretend to use Ni Fe functions a lot hahaha,entp
duh  lmao,entp
We can all agree here that our ne is off the charts online ,entp
my Ne online        ,entp
It s basically a less pessimistic   negative version of me   cause ruining people s moods would kill me  It s also a more people oriented version  because when I actively participate is when I feel more socially extroverted  The rest is just me ,entp
My Te is definitely emphasized more online than it is in real life sometimes ,entp
it s cool troll people online,entp
I always try to be nice and kind as possible on the internet and I ll also describe my internet persona as  having a kind word for everyone    love to all of you       And btw love ENFJs so much   Note I would not consider myself to be THAT nice and kind in reality  for those people in my real life would probably describe me as cold  insensitive  and angry LOL   and this is why INTERNET PERSONA exist as we always like to behave differently on the internet,entp
terrible ,entp
I think he s an ENTP just by how sarcastic and funny he is  also a little more social,entp
  I am going to just copy paste a reply I made so if some of this doesn t make sense its because of that  I just think I made some good points that debunk some common ENTP arguments     Your dominant Ne argument is based solely on the fact that he has an spontaneous sense of humour and that he  sees the possibilities in jokes   That s barely an Ne argument because anyone regardless of MBTI type can act that way  because thats the foundation of humour  If anyone who likes to make jokes on the spot is an Ne dom  half of the world would be Ne dominant   You then mention he also uses Ne when he quits his job  but I don t think you remember correctly how that went down  He didn t use Ne AT ALL  he stayed in a job he hated just for the pure comfort and routine of it  being afraid of the unknown and therefore staying in it for years  This is an example of his unhealthy Ti  Si  He only quit his job after he was under pressure from another person  Monica   He actually didn t see any possibilities of his dream job  he was so close minded and stuck in his was  Ti Si   until Monica who uses Te Ne  helped him find a better opportunity  This is Monica s Ne  not Chandler s   Your aux Ti could also be applied to dominant and even tert positions  You mention how he  brings the group back down to earth with his logic   That s more of a dom Ti or even Te  like ross    Tert Fe is not childish  Again  a stereotype  Tert Fe helps the user communicate  read  and express emotionally more easily with others  all of which Chandler has a lot of trouble with  He is extremely uncomfortable with expressing his emotions to others  like when the girls were trying to cheer him up after his break up with Janice   and with the emotions of others  think back to his quote  I m not great at the advice  can I interest you in a sarcastic comment     In the inferior Si argument  you are basically saying that tert Si users only use Si healthily  and Si infs  unhealthily  Neither is true  Any Si user   and any person for that matter   can go to the past both for good and bad motives  In fact you mention how Si infs are trapped in nostalgia and negative thoughts  That sounds more like Si tert because Si inf  with dominant Ne often prefers not to dwell on the past  and instead quickly move on from experience to experience  Everything in your inf Si argument screams dom or tert Si ,entp
Dominant Ne  Dominant Ne users see possibilities and opportunities in everything  In Chandler s case this can be seen a lot by how he sees everything as an opportunity to make a joke  In every situation he quickliy gathers every joke idea  This can also be seen in his career where he quits his well paying job because he  sees better opportunities  about his dream job  Auxiliary Ti  Aux Ti users guide others with logical reasoning  mostly around Fi users  The biggest example is his entire relationship with basically everyone  Yes he most of the time messes around with them but it can be seen that he also  in some cases indirectly  tell others his subjective logic and change their opinions with it  He is the one who brings the group back down to earth with his logic  Tertiary Fe  Tert Fe users find relief through connecting with people and or their friends like a child  Around the people they know  tert fe users are observed to be childlike and often referred as  the child  of the group   Inferior Si  Unlike tertiary si users who uses past as a way to be happy and be reliefed  they are trapped in bad feelings and thoughts that nostalgia brings  As we can see in the show  embarassing moments and or bad situations make him remember his past thus feel bad about the situation because he can relate his past to it  mostly parental issues of his past   So no he is not INTP because he is quirky  no he is not INTP because he acts like a child which in fact proves that he is an ENTP   no he is not INTP because he is inteoverted  Use  Cognitive  Functions ,entp
BEST    CHARACTER    EVER     So sarcastic and fun ,entp
Who the      changed the picture  ,entp
I think he s an INTP yes he use Ne so well but Ti is so clear too,entp
i haven t even watched this show  i just watched one of those compilation videos that showed up in my youtube recommended about chandler  and he gives off such strong xntp vibes,entp
This guy    who is terrified of uncertainty  the unknown is an Ne dom  The guy who is only secure and comfortable and able to function healthily when everything in his life is stable and permanent  The guy who sticks with a job he hates for years and years and years until he quits because he s away from home and his wife and friends  The guy whose Ne tert wife has to encourage him to make the most of his unemployment and explore his options  who freaks out over losing the newness in their relationship while he is just happy that things have become reliable and stable   He screams inferior Ne  That he is a   does not explain how poorly and neurotically his Ne comes out and how it is repressed in favor of Si  His humour is not a strong argument for dominant Ne  especially when his jokes are always about shooting down everyone else s crazy ideas and bringing them back to reality ,entp
i think in this case Ne Ti  By letter he could be an INTP but by function i see more Ne,entp
Argument has pivoted between ENTP  ESTJ  and ENFJ  with Fe and Ne commonly being referenced  Perhaps we have a ESFJ amongst us  who displays a great usage of Ne  Personally  I wouldn t point to ENFJ due to a general absence of Ni   Also  I don t feel she has stellar Ti  I feel her Fe and Ne much outshine the possibility of Ti aux  like ENTP,entp
I would agree with ENTP so far   Si inferior  the stronger preference is to always see new ways of doing things so for Ne doms they do not like routines and procedures as they believe that it suffocates them from exploring for more possibilities    https   youtu be Vbu HOCti c t        Ne dominance   They can be dried mandu  its a typical lets just wing it Ne usage like how I use my Ne    I will edit this if I see more Ti Fe axis but for now this is what is prominent to her,entp
Why not ESTP  I thought she was ESTP even when she received ESTJ at   p ,entp
I m actually more curious as to why we type any of the BL  KPI K members  since it s not as if they show many genuine expressions of their personal thoughts or feelings  This is also why I think that people should probably stop placing heavy emphasis on just a couple of quotes of theirs  as it s too difficult to discern what they might be thinking through them ,entp
I am pretty sure she is an Fe dom  I ve looked many ways of her being a Te or Ne dom as everybody is saying that she is either ESTJ ENTP but the more i watch her the more i m convinced she s an Fe dom   The most obvious thing i see is that jisoo always mimicks her partner s vibe  Do u guys realize how jisoo is a total different person when she s with jennie  lisa  and ros   She s chaotic when with lisa  she s soft when with ros   and she s nurturing when with jennie  It s like jisoo always wants the other person to feel comfortable around her  She always puts up with lisa s joke even when jennie or ros  dont think the joke is funny  because she doesnt want lisa to feel bad  She CONSTANTLY talks about how she wants to take care of her members  I know she doesnt use Fi since she has difficulties expressing her inner emotions  When something happens  most times rather than talking about how it makes her feel  most of the times she point out how the other person would feel about the situation   As for the Ni or Si  i dont know for sure  But i m more towards Ni,entp
Someone explained it before that Jisoo s Fi is her weakest function  Regardless those in ESTJ camp will assume  but they won t be able to explain  that it s inferior Fi even though it s obviously not there whatsoever  losing a brain cell every time I tried to understand their arguments   Quoting from earlier post I saw on this page   For instance  other members said Coachella was like a dream  Jisoo said she wishes she could ve felt it emotionally like they did   To me it sounds like trickster Fi   th function aka the least developed function in the stacking   Fi is a judging decision making function based on personal values or feelings towards things  Meaning those with higher Fi in their stacking  like Jennie and quite possibly Lisa  are in tune with their internal feelings  You could say Fi dom or Fi aux readily know what she likes  know what she feels  about coachella in this case   Jisoo  on the other hand  has trouble understanding what she feels about coachella  This is partly because she is so used to utilizing her more developed and preferred Ti in her decision making process  So when it comes to tasks that require Fi like telling people what she feels about things  it doesn t come as naturally for her  My bf also has trickster Fi in his stacking and whenever I ask something like  Do you like this movie or that   he would answer  movie A is good bcs    movie B is good bcs     You can tell his answer comes from a logical standpoint  Ti  rather than what he truly FEELS about them  Fi   Those with trickster Fi are so used to using Ti to fill in the job that usually Fi does  Similarly  Jisoo seems to not have clear understanding of her feelings towards coachella while other members were quick to point out that performing on coachella feel like a dream for them  This is bcs in this case Ti can t give her the answer about how she FEELS about coachella  something that seems like an easy task for Fi users ,entp
How does she use Fi   I don t think she value things using her own personal values and she doesn t really view her values opinions as her assets like Fi users do ,entp
I came here because I m curious to see someone with the same MBTI and enneagram as mine  However  I honestly think she s ESTJ  Correct me if I m wrong but here is my argument   I know I should not base her type off mine  But if you were to imagine an ENTP  w   won t it be the type of ENTP who is more expressive of emotions and is not so big on organization  If I were to judge off the comments  she seems to have high Te and low Fi  In my perspective  the confusion comes from the stereotypical Te doms being serious  bossy  and is on efficiency mode most of the time  With her having enneagram    or even     her Te comes off as mellow and not so obvious   I don t know but  can you imagine an Ne dom  w  saying things like       I never dream to be anything not possible    You cannot disobey the truth of life   When working in a group  everyone has their place and a role  And when everyone settles into their roles  that s how synergy is born   when everyone is where they need to be  big things can happen    And if you were to down vote  at least explain why you think I m wrong  It s annoying ,entp
I m guilty as charged for mistyping Jisoo as ESTJ before  Last month or so we saw a great turnaround thanks mostly to   jy    Mnc    chi      twicecutie    stillstephen    Tina      among many others for their contributions AND most importantly US for finally typing Jisoo correctly  To those     people who still see her as ESTJ  I get it I was in your position too not too long ago  What I can offer you is this  Arguments for Te dominant ESTJ tend to come from Jisoo s character when she is AT WORK or something that is not exclusively Te  Arguments for ENTP tend to come from her character in casual settings  Entertainment industry in Korea and public perceptions tend to be strict  rigid and too idealistic  ENTP itself doesn t fare well in situations like that  Jisoo being smart as she is  knows it too and maintains a public persona that is well accepted by the industry consciously or not  In her situation it means she has to appear less chaotic  more organized  more responsible therefore appearing very much like ESTJ while hiding her playful and funny ENTP self  Not very hard because she isn t usual ENTP to begin with  but makes it difficult for us to correctly type her  I found contents from the likes of Blackpink House and other casual events tend to be more representative of her actual personality because we get to see her side while she isn t at work  though technically she still is  Also contents where the other members share what Jisoo is like in real life  There hopefully you can read between the lines and witness that she is actually ENTP trying to mimic ESTJ and not the other way around  Unless of course if those     people still think we should type other people based on their personality in a work situation or their public image  FWIW I saw on twitter recently someone said even Jisoo s music preference is very much ENTP  And that guy wasn t trying to type her mbti ,entp
is her attitudinal psyche correct  I think she isnt vlef,entp
I feel that he is more  w  than  w   wing   is characterized by always thinking about risks  that is why they tend to be paranoid and insecure  they do not have enough confidence to make their own decisions  but instead when Gumball is decided on something he does everything that it is in his power to achieve it  regardless of the risks that this entails  He does not usually think about the consequences of his actions  he can even be quite impulsive  that is why I think that wing   suits him better  which is based on a determined and energetic character ,entp
currently thinking abt the possibility of    ,entp
One of the nice s ENTP S I ve ever seen  I wanted to be like him in childhood,entp
ok ill explain why i think gumball is a  w  considering his core then   well i guess this article explains it more    https   enneagrampaths com            enneagram types  w  vs  w      The Seven will desire to do something  but the  w will start to doubt themselves and analyze the risks involved  This makes  w s more indecisive   The Seven will desire to do something  but the  w will start to doubt themselves and analyze the risks involved  This makes  w s more indecisive    Like ive said in previous arguments  gumball just jumps into whatever he wants to do not considering the different possibilities that could come even though it s obviously super duper unsafe  if he really wants chocolate but a crocodile is in front of him HE WILL WRESTLE THAT CROCODILE  i dont know it was an example i had in mind but anyway the point is he doesnt think about the risks which is another reason i think he might even be an ESTP      w s are pleasure oriented to an extreme  The  w helps the Type Seven get exactly what they want  Stressed  w s can seem demanding and pushy  They become increasingly irresponsible and excessive the further they disintegrate  Short term thinking can take over so the  w  gains things immediately without assessing any risks   w s don t mentally travel as much into the future anticipating what might go wrong  Instead  the  w adds future goals and the ability to reach those goals with a strong willingness to take charge  They can seem less friendly than the  w   because they care less about what others think and refuse to be put into boxes   Gumball will do almost anything to get what he wants and we can also see him negotiating with others to do so   also something a sp   would do    We can even see him push Darwin away at times acting selfish and greedy   Stressed  w s care less about people who feel limiting or who will frustrate their plans  Honestly I can t explain more I ve already made   or   arguments about this  I also think Gumball s variant should change to sp   so people can look into that as well  Gumball is definitely so blind ,entp
I thought at first ESTP  but his Ne scares me,entp

another argument on why gumball is  w  and not  w   Type   description   Sixes are reliable  hard working  responsible  and trustworthy  Basic Fear  Of being without support and guidance Basic Desire  To have security and support  tbh darwin shows these traits much more  gumball has very strong ne but he rarely uses his imagination to think about the consequences of what his actions may be  and when he does  he dismisses it and goes along with his mischievous plans that have very unsafe and unfortunate endings  darwin being by his side warns and alert gumball of what hes going to do but gumball dismisses his advice due to his stubbornness  gumballs lack of si also effects this imo  he doesnt learn from his mistakes even if he knows the ending wont be great  HE HAS SO MANY NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES LIKE HOMIE NEEDS TO CALM DOWN  gets thrown at windows  almost  sometimes does fall off of buildings  gets beat up so much  punches himself on purpose sometimes  and gets into so many problems almost every episode  an episode of him acting the opposite would include him actually thinking about his descisions and avoiding danger  honestly  the type   description is the opposite of how gumball acts  i dont know how this many votes for  w  happened in the first place  im open to see your thoughts but im sure gumball is a  w  ,entp
why gumball has a   fix    heres my reply from one comment    although it may seem he has no   fix to you    and   wouldnt make sense at all either  in many episodes we can see him showing many traits of being a   especially when its in a situation where he is trying to prove himself   The Test  was a pretty memorable episode and he tried to hold in all his insults to others so he would be liked more   and they did lol    He genuinely does want to be liked by others and will sometimes even go great lengths to do the things he does because that s just what gumball does       though gumball is very lazy  he has a lot of moments where he does things just to be liked and be shown as  cool   another example is  The Ollie  where he tries really hard to convince Darwin that he can skateboard to be cool   he wants to be seen as impressive to others and show   traits in way more episodes of him trying to be helpful and show   traits ,entp
I do not see his   wing  I watched almost the whole series and never saw him taking the lead,entp
wtf  why is he an ENTP sx so  w   i dont see any sx   in him and he is      so   blind  also his wing   is unapparent other than him being funny and jokey  and intuitive  intuition talks about the  what ifs  and  what could happen   i dont see gumball favouring this ,entp
I m not good at typing real people and those around me  I m unsure what his MBTI or Enneagram is  I keep flipping between INTJ  INTP  and ISTJ  If I really had to guess then maybe INTP  He was someone who rekindled my love of learning  School had beaten me down and made me lose a lot of myself  especially my curiosity  He was my history teacher primarily  I had a lot of classes with him  It was a dream come true  He was passionate about these things and actually cared to teach and show us what was really important  Help guide me in ways I don t think he ll ever know  He was the best father figure I ever had  grandfather even  He helped me become more rational  more inquisitive  and helped me become who I needed to be  He was one of my only reasons for even going to school each and every single day at one point  and when he wasn t there man that sucked lol  It was very beneficial both ways  me and my friend  INTP  who also looked up to him  were his favorites  I know that seems a little um rude and self centered  But it was because of us that he was able to teach the way he wanted and have students who actually cared and challenged him even  Very intellectual convos and questions that he d never been asked  I miss that kind of communication  Great dude  very important part of my life  He made my last two years of high school a great experience and I am forever thankful ,entp

ENTP   ENTJ   ENFP   ENFJ,entp
Definitely ENTJ  They are more responsible professionally  financially  ethically  intellectually  ENTJ INFJ are actually great match compared to ENTP INFJ ,entp
can you guys read about enneagram subtypes or something because I m tired of social characters being voted so  just because they re outgoing  if you read about   subtypes he s clearly not a so   he s a sx   possibly even sp   https   www personalitycafe com threads sexual sevens according to beatrice chestnut        ,entp
Guys academics do not equal intelligence  if you really want to see his true intellect  read the manga  specifically the sports festival    SimoneTumbuka  goes into more detail about it in the comments,entp
Don t underestimate this pokemon  Has some intellect  And especially a way with words   and Ne when describing a fanciful turd  A true intellect  On a more serious note he uses plenty of Ne when strategizing on the battlefield imo and you can definitely see core   with his frequent cringe dad jokes  His self doubt and frequent need for assurance probably comes from his lower Fe but seems like a fun  lighthearted dude that just wants keep things positive        ,entp
This guy is like the definition of a  w   For those of you who think he is a   because he is loyal  just think more about how that side of his personality doesn t compare with his fun loving and relaxed side of him  But  idk  I guess I could be wrong ,entp
Wouldn t he be more of a  w  than  w    From his Wiki Page   Denki becomes quickly distraught when put into stressful situations  to the point of appearing spineless and incompetent to foes and allies alike  During combat  he is very quick to panic and may accidentally activate his Quirk in the face of any imminent danger  leaving himself vulnerable in the process  He becomes more reluctant to use his full power when there are allies close to him  being afraid of hurting them through collateral damage from his volatile bolts  When he is assured that all his allies will be safe from his powers  he becomes more confident in his fighting abilities  He does not tolerate others looking down on him or his classmates and will defend them if necessary  ,entp
In german we say  Ehrenmann ,entp
Literally where is his ne  The only arguments I m seeing here are for fe   fi  He s never questioning everything and all his observations actions are based around what s happening around him   During the Provisional Licence Exam when he follows Kirishima and Bakugou  instead of listing off what ifs possible reasons as to why he didn t want to be by himself  he just says that he was scared to be alone  When the meatball guy started attacked them  he didn t make inferences either  he just reacted to everything he was doing   He never comes up with actual strategies or new ideas to try and use his quirk in the most optimal way  he just goes in hoping his sheer power can take them down on its own  Jirou was the one that came up with the  human stun gun  idea during the USJ incident and Power Loader was the one who came up with the idea to get him sharpshooting equipment   His inability to read the room has nothing to do with tangents or rants of any kind and more to do with his bluntness  which is se not ne  Also preferring to follow trends instead of doing your own thing is more common with se users   Just because he can come up with creative come backs and y all self project onto him  doesn t make him an ne dom ,entp
Why is non curious the consensus  He s shown to have a wide range of interests and even though his grades are poor he s still quite knowledgeable  I definitely see him as more inquisitive  my guess is either SCUAI or SLUAI ,entp
He doesn t show se fi at all  His ne ti is really obvious  what drugs are ESFP voters even on  ,entp
I copy paste this again because a lot of people are mistaking Denki s functions due  mbtiTikTok    Fe vs  Fi  it just can t be ESFP because he doesn t show Fi at all  Fi is about self expression  uniqueness and identity sense while Denki is obsessed by fit in  he lack of uniqueness indeed  he loves anything that is trendy  while high Fi don t care about the trends or people approval because is not what Fi is about  while Fe is about fit in  be seen as popular or trendy but he has a shallow understanding of how to do it and that can indicate a low Fe  So we can exclude all the type who use Fi  xxFP and xxTJ  because he doesn t show it at all   Se  one of the biggest flaws of Denki who is often pointed out by Aizawa and by his classmates is his inability to give an immediate physical response during a fight  indeed in physical confrontation Denki tend to freeze  People may think that is due is fear of hurting people but in reality is simply because Denki fear physical confrontation  One of the characteristic of high Se is indeed being quick in physical responses  having fast reflexes living in the moment while  Denki becomes quickly distraught when put into stressful situations  to the point of appearing spineless and incompetent to foes and allies alike  During combat  he is very quick to panic and may accidentally activate his Quirk in the face of any imminent danger  leaving himself vulnerable in the process    from fandom wiki  while high Se as Kirishima s have no problem in jump in physical confrontation without thinking twice  indeed Kirishima s flaw is the exact opposite to Kaminari s   Also his way of speaking do not indicate Se since he is not straight to the point in communication but he use metaphors and he  turn around the concept  who are not common for high Se  In the mall OVA we can also see Denki don t notice the fact that the ceiling is falling above him and he is saved by Kirishima and Bakuguo  So we can exclude all high Se  xSxT    Ti vs Te  I think here most of ppl get confused about Denki  Ti is often mistaken ad symptom of intelligence  this is a lie  Ti is the internal logical reasoning without using external sources while Te is base on data  reality and strong fact  Ti developes their own models without the need to relate to external sources and for this reason Te user are more likely to be academically skilled than Ti users  We never see Denki relating to fact indeed he make the choice who makes sense for him not that makes sense in an absolute way  Te users want to impact the real world and they re driven by goals  such as Bakugou  Denki don t have a particular purpose or seems interested in putting effort in anything  So we can exclude all the high Te users  xxTJ   I m not saying that his Ti is high but is still higher than his Te    Ne  is about connection  big picture  missing details  brainstorm ecc  If we look at Denki s room we can see that he has various interest in a lot of different areas indeed girls judge his room as  too much   He is not able to stick with study routine requiring the help of Momo for passing his exams but he is the most knowledgeable in the thing he is interested in such as literature  art ecc  the hyperfixation for some interest is indeed a high Ne inf Si characteristic  Also is way to express  Denki often use metaphors  for example when he roast bakuguo he use a useless amount of words for saying  hey  you have a sh tt  personality    indeed one of the nicknames Bakugou gives to him is  Mr  Vocabulary   due is articulate and particular way to communicate  The use of an unusual lexicon and of a peculiar periods structure and metaphors are indeed Ne indicators  Moreover in manga Denki is often showed in going off topic  speaking of weird stuff who seems unrelated to the current situation but that are distantly related to that situation  this is litteraly Ne   Moreover  we have to consider also that unluckily BNHA secondary characters are not really well in depth inside characters psychology and Kaminari s thoughts flow  as well as a lot of other character  is never showed  so we must relate on his way to communicate and his decisions  For all the reason above I think that the closer type who is able to describe is personality is ENTP while ESFP is totally senseless due his lack of Se and the absence of Fi  I d say more even ESFJ make more sense than ESFP ,entp
i kinda see him as a ti dom but idk ENTP seems to make the most sense for him,entp
you know  sometimes I forget that this guy s typed as a      ,entp
       I would like to give an argument to support everyone s argument as to why Dazai is so   instead of sp    Again  this is just a feeble attempt of mine to explain someone s type    Disclaimer  This is gonna be a lengthy explanation  Please bear with me as we uncover Dazai s actual enneatype   When typing someone s Enneagram  I believe that EVERYTHING must be considered  Fixation  Holy Idea  Trap  Passion  Virtue  Disintegration  Integration  Instinctual Variant  Centers of Intelligence  as well as the core fears and desires  and when I say everything  I mean EVERYTHING  not one aspect to be left out  Also  let us not stereotype everything as this will only end in a mistype  Instead of seeing the whole picture  we just prefer to see the side or detail that we would like to see  leading to a wrong conclusion   Let me start this off by dismissing E  arguments  As per everyone s knowledge  E  is from the heart triad  meaning that the underlying issue for this triad is Shame  However  shame is not to be seen in Dazai  If we were to take the meaning of shame literally  Dazai is freaking shameless  and he is not the type to get conscious of his image    Another one  sp   is the countertype of    which means that this would not look like   at times  And since this is the countertype  it would be the most logical variant to apply to Dazai s character since he also seems to be long suffering in his being  Also  core   arguments state that Dazai is in search of his identity  as with the basic fear and desire of E   However  although I don t consider ENTP   as impossible  having such a combination is kinda illogical due to the rationality logicality of the minds of ENTPs  due to their Ti aux  and the emotionality of E   They may be rare  yes  but Dazai is not a core    I may agree if   is his fix  but not as his core type    Now  if we were to take fixations  holy ideas  traps  passions  and virtues into account  it is true that Melancholy can be seen in Dazai  but not Holy Origin  Authenticity  Envy  and Equanimity  Let me remind all of you that Dazai is in search of the meaning of his life  not his whole identity  Since when did he get envious of this and that    Now  let us tackle E  s disintegration and integration  E  disintegrates to   and integrates to    Since when did we see Dazai disintegrate to    Since when did we see him act like a   when stressed and get all sulky just because his affections and acts were not reciprocated or because his individuality was not seen  In all honesty  him disintegrating to   makes much more sense than him disintegrating to     Onto one of the Core   arguments  his fixation  E  s fixation is Stinginess  As from what I have read  this is a desire for anonymity and viewing life from the sidelines  Allow me to give an example of that    SPOILER FROM STORM BRINGER   There was this part in Storm Bringer where he planned how to capture Verlaine  As his plan commences and proceeds  with Hirotsu by his side  they were just viewing everything that is unfolding from Dazai s plan from the sidelines   One more thing  whenever he plans something  he never involves himself in his plan  except when he needs to intervene   I know someone who is a social    and I can see their similarities in terms of observing  planning  and such   Another Stinginess description that I have read   A scarcity paradigm that leads to an insatiable thirst for knowing  a reluctance to share   knowledge  time  space  and personal information   and to strategizing about how to control one s environment    I forgot where I read this  but  from what I remember  Dazai said that   I m a very private person  You don t ask  I don t tell   This is exactly why Dazai is mysterious  he never reveals his personal information and what he does on a regular basis  aside from the persona facade that he keeps on putting  This can also be seen in one of the episodes where Atsushi is guessing his former profession  and Kunikida says that his former profession is one of the seven mysteries of the ADA   Another one is how Dazai schemes  how he completely controls his environment  and how everyone dances in the palm of his hands  His intelligence and predictive ability contribute to this behavior of his  Another example that I would use would be from    Minutes    ANOTHER SPOILER AHEAD FROM    MINUTES   During their mission where Atsushi s memories from the future were brought to the past to prevent what had happened  Atsushi disclosed such information to Dazai and Kunikida even though Wells strictly told Atsushi not to disclose it to anyone  Anyway  to help Atsushi  Dazai manipulated everything  even torturing that captain  Poor captain  Atsushi realized later that they were dancing in the palm of Dazai s hands ,entp
Why is everyone insisting on  w    ,entp
Why do y all think he s a  w    gen really nobody here has valid arguments and I don t see any characteristic traits of  w  in him  I can tell bc I m a   core  and I m     sure that you typed him as  w  just because you think he is faking his smile and in reality he s just like yozo    please stop they re two diffrent characters and we don t have any proof from him in the manga or even in the anime that he s faking his personality so we could tell he s a   core    Idk what enneagram he is bc I don t have time to read about it again and analyse it now but I m sure on       he isn t a   core,entp
what is this  w  erasure  i dont see why he s voted as a w ,entp
I apologize in advance  this is going to be a lot of rambling because i am honestly very confused but still I want to give my thoughts for consideration about this guy s enneagram   I doubt he is part of the heart triad  The heart triad deals with feelings of being unworthy of love  So their basic goal is to prove themselves worthy to the eyes of others  That goes for  s   s and  s    Examples of heart triad types would be Atsushi    core   Many times he thought and believed that it would be better if he didn t exist  he feels the need to earn his right to live by being of use and helping others   Or again Akutawaga  sx    who is entirely motivated by envy and jealousy  He wants to prove himself worthy because he feels inferior to others      s especially  withdraw from others in order to create for themselves a mysterious and unique aura to attract attention this way  Sp s  specifically  long to tolerate pains as a mean to believe they are worthy of love and gain it from others  All of this doesn t describe Dazai at all  He  until now  isn t struggling with self value nor is seeking self validation or attention from others like heart triad types do    In some way  I think he fits head triad more         Types       and   make up the Head Triad  and each of these types focuses on the theme of Inner Guidance and Support  This translates to issues around Anxiety and Insecurity for them  and like the other triads  each of these three types will have a slightly different strategy to handle those issues  The Thinking types are also known as the Fear triad  They have more difficulty  relative to the types in the other two triads  with making decisions and making plans for their future  The Head types tend to focus on some  unique aspect of  worst case scenario  thinking  which  in turn  can develop their creativity      The mental activity is our effort to create a ground for a sense of ourselves  and to produce a sense of guidance and direction       This fits quite well with Dazai imo  His depression seems so come from a lack of guidance in life   he can t find meaning and   when he joined the mafia  tried to seek it through outside occupations  Sx  typically have a need to idealize reality to more than what is it and are often mistaken for  s  Dazai seems more like a depressed sx  to me  struggling to find something to live for  and  not being able to find it  then having to deal with feelings of anxiety concerning the lack of clarity in his life  He isn t seeking meaning as in a search for personal identity or expressiveness  but rather meaning as in something to give life itself a sense     Those explications are a bit all over the place  I am currently half way through season two  I am going to wait till I finish all seasons before officially settling for a type and rewrite a more coherent argument later lol  Strongly leaning towards   core for now ,entp
can someone explain why  E    E for ap,entp
why   wing for his enneagram ,entp
Can someone give an explanation of sp so   I think that he is  w  so it would have to be in relation to that btw  I thought that he would be sp sx at first but I really don t know the instinctual variant system that well ,entp
It s funny how ISFJ is considered the opposite of ENTP when its just the same functions in reverse  If we flip the function orientation as well we get ESFP  but it s still funny because many ENTPs act just like one ,entp

I relate to ISTP a lot more than I feel like I should  It s how I tend to act around my friends and honestly most people  I suppress my emotions way to much and I hardly open up about my feelings  If you think you ve gotten through my shell  think again lol  It s really easy for me to set aside my emotions in most things so then I come across as uncaring and insensitive  Really stoic around new people and stoic in public unless with a friend or my mother  In the real world and around me  it s easy to get lost in the emotions and issues of others and don t get me wrong  I do  But It s also easy for me to just ignore it and set it aside  examine it later when I have time to myself  I m very hands on and love to explore new things and implement new ideas  I also can oddly enough remain the calm one in times of disarray  At least when everyone around me is panicking that is   Comfort is something I value very highly and don t put too much effort into my everyday look  I just want to be comfortable and that s good enough for me   I think I have gone to unnecessary depths explaining myself lol ,entp
being a shy extrovert is weird,entp
i guess that s because im in the age of developting my Ne  so im showing off a lot of extroversion now than when i was younger and was very shy due to my Fi hero ,entp

To all the people that says that Gojo has a well developed Fe   He doesn t  In fact  his Fe is oftenly very bad  This guy doesn t know how to show affection or be decent  and you only have to take a look at his relationship with people like Utahime or Nanami   It seems that Gojo deprecates Utahime for being weak  but this is VERY FAR from being true  Gojo likes her  but he doesn t know how to express that and thats why he ends doing a display of acid jokes to piss her off and have her attention  The same goes with Nanami ,entp
https   www personalitycafe com threads self preservation sevens according to beatrice chestnut          Read this and came to a conclusion that gojo  without any doubt  is a Sp  ,entp
Im not sure if he s a so  or sp ,entp
How the hell is this guy typed as an so     He s so obviously an sp  ,entp
Can someone explain his attitudinal psyche,entp
How is he so   i think he s very clearly sp    Self Preservation Sevens express gluttony through the formation of alliances  They typically collect around them a kind of family network  in the sense of banding together with trusted others and creating a good  mafia  or partisan group through which they can get their needs met  They rely mostly on those they trust  These Sevens create a kind of surrogate family of people they value a family in which they typically occupy a privileged position  Naranjo says there is a kind of reciprocal interest in these relationships  expressed in the idea that  I will serve thee  and thou will serve me     Gojo places a lot of importance on his students  He trains them  and in return  they become better sorcerers and fix the skewed jujutsu society he dislikes  He fulfills his students needs to become stronger  and his students carry out his wish to change the system  We also see this with his friendship with Nanami  Him and Nanami are friends  but there is an implication that they are using each other as a way to replace their former friends  Since they both find it hard to cope with the death of their close friends  they  create an alliance  with each other to feel better  Gojo befriends Nanami  who reminds him of Geto  and Nanami befriends Gojo  who reminds him of Haibara  They fulfill each other s needs for their former relationship by  mimicking  them    Self Preservation Sevens always have their nose to the wind for good opportunities  These Sevens are very practical  good at networking  and skilled at getting what they want and finding a good deal  they tend to be opportunistic  self interested  pragmatic  calculating  and clever  They hold the position that if you are not alert to opportunities  you will lose out    Gojo is always on the lookout for new ways to improve his technique  especially in high school when he focused on developing infinity  He also finds new opportunities to teach his students  like when he took Itadori with him to fight Jogo  In another scene  we see him telling Megumi that the way to improve his skills was to take the opportunity  and to not hesitate    Self Preservation Sevens cultivate a sense of being kind and generous they like to feel that everyone depends on them  They may feel omnipotent and they may sometimes use people  They may also feel that normal rules don t apply to them that for them  there is no law  and they can do what they please  And most of the time  they get away with getting what they want   It s no secret that Gojo is quite literally the strongest sorcerer  He often makes comments about higher ups  sometimes to their face  Principal Gakuganji is a victim of this  and can play it off as jokes  He truly does get away with lots of his behaviour since he holds high status  and he knows it  He is well aware of it  in fact    When they have the Social instinct in second place  they may look more like magnanimous Eights  people oriented and impulsive    Self explanatory  lmk if i said something wrong or u disagree,entp
thanks Gege for this man im crying,entp
WHY IS HE A SO  HE IS NOT ONE AT ALL  DEFINITELY NOT SO,entp
Is the only argument for his ne his training methods ,entp
according the se argument  It is obvious that the reason he voted as se user is he doesnt lives in a fantasy world and is realistic  Not every ne user has to be childish and detached from the world  in fact  ne users use abstract concepts for immediate and problem solving and dont go out of the current situation when they come up with ideas  sterotypical ne which is messy and complex and has trouble getting out of the way is unhealthy ne  he is actually a very healthy example of ENTP and unlike unhealty edgy psychopath anime boy ENTP sterotype ,entp
What pisses me off is that marvel s  th phase has made everything that was important and why Iron man died  as something that s not even worth it  Watching the stones being used as paper weight in TVA had me buring in frustration ,entp
More like what ENTP wish they were like    OMF HE S SO ME  ,entp
I think his Te is pretty developed and are much too organize as well as objective than Ti users   ENFP would also be reasonable but due to stereotype  nobody is going to think of him as ENFP   ENTP also make a lot of sense  but ENTJ   This dude is not ENTJ  there is no Ni  He just want to advance his theroy and make it into practice    Here is why I think he is ENFP with developed Te    Cognitive function wise I see Fi Fe as well    It is hard to type him  he is not stereotype ENTP  He is outgoing but at the same time is quite serious and organizing to the point he puts on an INTJ persona sometimes    So yes  for me ENFP and ENTP are both reasonable types for him  I just see Te Ti and Fi Fe,entp
my biggest kin right here,entp
 I see a suit of armor around the world    Ne for sure  go ahead  his intuition is driven to the object ,entp
Decisive  abrasive  and action oriented  He never lives in the world of ideas or the future like Thanos  and is instead more concerned with what s in front of him and taking opportunities at a moment s notice    I can understand how people could mistype him as an ENTP or ENTJ but not all ESTP s are braindead morons ,entp
TL DR he s a decisive  goal oriented Te implementer rather than an open ended Ne explorer  his journey is discovering   re evaluating his Fi priorities        Ni over Ne   In discussions around Tony Stark s type  his Ne is often taken for granted as self evident  but I actually have a hard time seeing Tony Stark as an Ne dom or Ne base  Where are the varied interests  the ongoing pursuit of new ideas  He shows much more of a singular focus  first as an executive and then later in life as Mr  Iron Man himself  And note how he delegates executive business functions to Ms  Potts after joining the Avengers  he wants to go all in on one pursuit rather than juggling multiple projects at a time  Even two is one too many  Potts can deal with the business  because Stark has to focus on the Avengers now   Likewise  he s very future focused and time oriented  look at the amount of forethought and planning he puts into designing Ultron  He fixates on a singular idea for years and years of his life  and meanwhile  I can t even tell if the man has ever had any outside interests  hobbies  or side projects        Te over Ti   Ti users   Ti valuers tend to be more theoretic based  exploring an idea for the sake of understanding  to develop precision  for the idea s own sake  That s not Tony Stark  he s all about application  He develops weapons to meet US  defense  needs  he builds the original Iron Man to get himself out of a cave  he continues developing technology for the sake of applying it to specific projects  He s not engaging in projects for the sake of the project itself  or to learn something or build an understanding or test an idea   everything he does is tailored to some external benchmark for failure or success   This is not to say that Stark can t  use  Ti  he s still a skilled logician  However   and especially in the first Iron Man movie   he s prone to dismissing logical frameworks or ideas if they fall outside of what he s trying to implement  He s a Te goal oriented task master who attaches his self worth to being productive  effective  successful  and he doesn t want to waste his time on purposeless theoretic meandering        Fi over Fe   ENTPs   ILE s are known for being charming  for engaging in witty banter  What I see with Stark  however  is qualitatively very different  he s openly arrogant  gruff  and dismissive   and most importantly  he s  okay  with coming off that way   Plenty of Fe users are perfectly capable of arrogance  but they typically at least try to mask it somehow   Stark s quick on his feet  but most of his humor is of a Te dom style where he ll sarcastically castigate somebody for being particularly ineffective or inefficient   However  Stark has this steady undercurrent of introverted feeling  he s clearly insecure about his relationship with his dead father  which compromises his sense of self worth  when faced with the effects of his company s weapons  he experiences a wave of self loathing  looking inward to question his motivations and his personal sense of morality  and in End Game  he makes it clear that his    goal is  protecting what s mine   His values are attached to his close inner circle rather than some collective group or society as a whole  and he builds his personal self worth through being the Te provider for those few people he Fi cares about        DISCLAIMER  Yes  I know it s possible for somebody to be typed differently in MBTI   Socionics  For my own purposes  I m focusing only on people who IMO capture what both systems have to say about the same functions IM s   In other words  I m not typing Stark as LIE because I think he s ENTJ  I m commenting on Stark because I think he s both LIE and ENTJ   E g  I could see a strong argument for typing Ms  Potts as ISTJ ISFJ in MBTI yet ESI in socionics  but I m more interested in people who I see as occupying the overlap between the two systems ,entp
Sexual    Hisoka is stereotype of sp   ,entp
i m avoiding voting on his MBTI because i need to read more arguments before coming to a conclusion  but i ve been re watching HXH from heaven s arena onwards  and i m beginning to see hisoka as an ESTP   to me he has strong Se and Ne  it s difficult for me to choose between the two for his dominant  the thing that s getting me is  if he s ENTP  the inferior Si  i don t know if i see it much  but i ll have to analyze his character a bit more ,entp
Hisoka is an ENTP with mental issues which makes him creating a lot of possibilites around fighting someone mentally and physically   Only because he likes fighting doesn t mean he is an ESTP  Also guys stop typing characters with mentall issues wrong u gotta bend the theory on those characters   also he is some kind of unpractical if it comes to himself which u can see in the interaction with Machi ,entp
His Se is so obvious in his fight with Chrollo,entp
Wait  I m curious since I m also new in mbti typing community  Where do you guys see his Ne  If it s about possibilities  I don t think he see that much possibilities like Ne do  What he see is the most possible possibilities like Ni  Moreover  if we look at his explanation of nen based on the user personality  that s probably the data collected by Se and formulated as patterns by Ni   I m open to any discussion  but please give a proper argument ,entp
What if Hisoka is actually a Ne Se   Ti   Fe hybrid without any inferior function and we are all wrong  Would that make us ESTP  ENTP  and ISTP voters all morons ,entp
His Ne is so obvious in his fight with Chrollo,entp
Hisoka didn t kill Gon immediately  and got excited at the thought of Gon being stronger  He s excited by a thought  A thought isn t real  Therefore  Ne    This is the argument ENTP voters regurgitate over and over again  Is this what Ne means to people  Because he s literally just excited at the thought of doing something physical  He s thinking about how his experience will be more intense and physically challenging when they re stronger  Do you think an ESTP can get excited at the thought of a more intense sensation  And do you therefore think an ESTP can hold off from acting immediately and wait for more that more intense sensation    If you do  then I recommend voting ESTP because       of all the ENTP arguments on this page rest on those two fundamental questions ,entp
The ESTP arguments are more convincing overall and ENTP arguments has some half truths in my opinion  Let s take a look on some ENTP arguments       Ne  because he is looking for possibilities  is a half truth  Hisoka does not look for pure possibilities  he looks for possibilities to feed his sensations through his   senses  it is much more mundane  Hisoka is looking for new experiences instead of different possibilities  It is Se       Ne  because he is looking for potentials  is another half truth  Again  he is looking at people potential in order to fight them and please his drive for good new sensations  Like he do with Gon and with Chrollo for example  He is a huge pleasure seeker and has pleasure to fight  He uses so much Se that I don t know how people are not seeing it   Everything that Hisoka do in life is to feed his Se  his hunger for better sensations  adrenaline  excitement through the   senses  Hisoka is all about the exactly extreme usage of Se  he is a complete pleasure seeker  almost a caricature   I will put here a quote from Carl Jung about the Extraverted Sensation type    The more sensation predominates  so that the sensing subject disappears behind the sensation  the more unsatisfactory does this type become  Either he develops into a crude pleasure seeker or he becomes an unscrupulous  designing sybarite  Although the object is entirely indispensable to him  yet  as something existing in and through itself  it is none the less depreciated  It is ruthlessly violated and essentially ignored  since now its sole use is to stimulate sensation     Carl Jung  Psychological Types   Hisoka is a good example of a smart ESTP ,entp
Example of Ne Ti users in HxH  Neferpitou  Shalnark and Shizuku Caught in so many ideas  often absent minded and confused because of that  Hisoka isn t an Ne Ti user  Even the majority of people here who claim that they are XNTPs  they aren t ,entp
i alllwasys think about this  i often see people using celeb s speech patterns and body language in interviews as proof of ne  not saying they re incorrect to   and i literally used to think i was ne dom because of how conveluded the way i speak is  also some people see someone slightly odd and vote enxp  whereas people will only consider INFJ if the celeb is real life dumbledore,entp
So my real type is ISTJ  w  sp sx     ELVF RLOEN  but I know for a FACT people would mistype me as an INFP     because of my political views and the fact that I m quite sensitive melancholic lazy basically not a robot phlegmatic hard working conservative ISTJ stereotype people have of it  It s interesting that people seem to get that the most sensitive out of thinkers are I TJs  if we look at the results on PDB page  but still see us  ISTJs especially  as literal robots  And I have   Se  that s why they won t go for ISFP  but would rather argue I m an INFP in a Fi Si loop  my Ne is kinda non existent as well lol     On the bright side I think people would type my attitudinal psyche correctly I m quite stereotypical ELVF  and no way people would type me as anything but  w  sp sx my   core really jumps out even in my manner of speaking and I don t shy away from confrontations if people come at me   People would mistype me in big   as RLOAI because nobody seems to know what E means and type everyone A until they re a literal selfish brat  And they would type me as I because a lot of people don t seem to comprehend that smart and scholarly   I ,entp
they will be like    Fi dom bcs i hate fake ppl and i am selfish          ne aux bcs i am creative  absent minded  lost and imaginative si tert bcs i forget things quite often but i still care about the past te inferior bcs i fight with my parents       like WTF        an fe user can also hate fake ppl and even si doms can be creative  and even si doms can be detached from reality and forget stuff and not always care bout the past  and even fe users can fight w their parents wtf,entp
I don t know but I m guessing XNFX,entp
I would do some crazy  hit  Not f cked  hit  but crazy  hit ,entp
He has emotions other than megalomania   SCREAAAAAMING    We haven t seen him kick a dog     Yep definitely a feeler  ,entp
Elon Musk be like,entp
depends what I m famous for  I m going to say INFP because my fi is very obvious  but I ve been mistyped as an INxP before by people I know  because my ni is pretty strong and se ni looks like ne sometimes,entp
Idk  everyone think Im an ENFP cause Ibdont agree ewith their opinions so they just label me as a toxic Fi user   Edit Gonna change my label to ENTP again,entp
People  because they love stereotyping  would probably think I m an ESTJ because of my political views and controversial opinions  Just imagine how many mistyped INTJs there are on this website  Too much to count ,entp
i can see why people vote ENFP because at first he did give me typical ENFP character vibes but tbh as a Fi dom i don t really see how he would be a Fi user  or like i may see it but i still think tert Fe makes way more sense imo   but idk it is funny to see the war in this comment section tho,entp
sure the votes may say venti is an ENTP but all the comments say ENFP so i think we know who the true winner is,entp
ahhh i literally dont know if they r a ENTP or ENFP,entp
I don t even play the game  but I see what s going on here   If you still think he s an ENTP  please explain your reasoning by replying to this  If you re dead set on him being an ENFP  feel free to also leave your reasoning in the replies ,entp
People keep saying Venti is an ENTP with well developed Fe  but I don t think they ve researched what that looks like  Overall  there seems to be a lack of understanding of the role the tertiary has within the function stack  ENTP use of Fe is unique to ENTPs and cannot exist independent of the influence of its function stack    An ENTP who makes good use of Fe will take pride in feeling responsible for the feelings of others  They are acutely aware of how what they say will impact others  and it s important for them to utilize this influence   The need to affect one s external world  Fe  can pull one s attention away from the intricacies of one s internal frameworks  Ti    ENTPs who lean into their Fe tend to focus only on enhancing their social utility  Venti doesn t seem to care about this at all  He s very content to take a passive position socially and acts like himself regardless of present company  People often remark that he s lazy  weird  or annoying  and he doesn t change his behavior or express discomfort in being perceived this way    Convergent ENTPS  will ensue a kind of lack of natural curiosity  and convergent employment of Introverted Sensing and Introverted Thinking only to the areas that directly affect this type s locus of control  For example  this type will often master skill sets  develop intricate social frameworks  but pay comparatively less attention to philosophy and existential concepts   Venti is clearly very philosophical  He s a romantic  and we can see this in his poetry  his ideas about freedom  and in long flowery speeches he gives throughout his story quests  While an ENTP can certainly take interest in philosophy and poetry as a result of Ne and Ti  when those three functions work together  they don t explain both his inclination towards the philosophical and his stubbornly empathetic nature  ENTPs with heavy use of Fe tend to  rely upon the Extroverted Feeling feedback of other people in order to conceive self concept and identity   Venti often seeks the opinions of others  but never about himself or his values  When he asks the Traveller for their opinion  it never causes him to reevaluate his own  he already knows what he believes and who he is without relying on others to define that for him   There s some mixed opinions on this  but I think Venti cares a lot about having influence  Fi users want to imbue others with their values  but they don t necessarily care about their name being attached  ENTPs in contrast  tend to aspire to exert influence BECAUSE of the weight their name holds  It s important for them to feel like they are the authority on something because of their logic and innovation  and they want other people to acknowledge it  Venti actively rejects being acknowledged  and delights in people underestimating him  ENFPs want their beliefs to be valued objectively  Te   regardless of the influence of their reputation  Venti feels especially strongly about this because his usage of Fi cannot be separated from his beliefs about freedom  If he shared his views subjectively and directly  without providing objective evidence  he would feel that that influence was meaningless and even contradictory to his beliefs because of his position as an archon  He DOES want people to come to the same conclusions as him about freedom  love  and even trivial things like his tastes in food  but he doesn t want to win them over through persuasion  he wants them to see what he sees  Te   and then agree because they also think it s right  Fi   In contrast to ENTPs who decide to take control  Venti actively rejects it   It also might be helpful to examine how other character s interpret Venti in canon  Paimon and other characters often remark about how Kaeya seems dishonest or has ulterior motives  even when as far as we can tell as an audience  he s being genuine  Though Venti makes no efforts to hide his mischievous and dishonest side from the Traveller or his other peers  I E  when he steals the lyre or when he lies to Jack during Stanley s quest   he is never referred to as disingenuous or fake  His reasons for lying are straightforward and obvious to others  Te  not Ti   and are usually the result of him empathizing with someone  Fi   Jung says   The force of extraverted feeling then pulls the personality into the object  the object assimilates him  whereupon the personal quality of the feeling  which constitutes its chief charm  disappears  It becomes cold   unfeeling   untrustworthy  It has ulterior motives  or at least makes an impartial observer suspect them   In other words  people tend to read ENTP Fe as fake  This is because the ENTP s Ne  Ti  and Fe work together to help the ENTP predict how other people will react and adjust how they conduct themselves accordingly  This is often out of genuine care for others  but it s still calculated and people often interpret that as manipulation ,entp
Most obvious Ne dom but I can t believe some of y all think of him as a ENFP    His Ne Fe usage man is so out there when he s talking about Dvalin and his suffering you can see so much Fe and his story quest just adds the cherry on top that s shows Fe Fi especially at the very end  His Ti has some notable moments but there s none that are really remarkable to me right now I ll edit this is I find evidence for Ti but for sure Venti is a ENTP there is little to no evidence of Fi and Te,entp
he doesn t show any ti  in my experience  his fe  while i see where one would come from  i rather see that he has healthy fi which manifests as fi  he s simply benevolent enough to take conciousness of what an individual needs  so it presents as the kind of social awareness and focus on  external  feelings which displays from fe  i see more te tertiary from him as well  as he does use te to make decisions and execute necessary steps towards reaching his goals which stem from his values and internal emotional attachment  fi   and helping him rescue a dragon convinced me of this,entp
How is he an fe user  Now  im not saying that fe users can t have beliefs  but i don t remember any signs that his beliefs are outward based,entp
Yo pienso que el es ENTP  el ser creativo y art stico no es algo exclusivo de los F  su personalidad tiende a ser mas guiada por su propia l gica que por una emoci n del momento  no veo a venti afectado por romper su propia lira y poner mal a Barbara  lo que expone en venti la cierta falta de empat a que tiene ante las situaciones que simplemente no le importan  los F tienden a ser mas emp ticos en situaciones generales  pero si bien si es emp tico con Dvalin  no se muestra as  con nadie mas que con el y con su amigo el bardo sin nombre  siendo solo as  con sus allegados   Con las dem s letras veo que la mayor a estamos de acuerdo as  que no tengo nada mas que aclarar  ser artista no lo hace un F y recalco esto por que ya son muchos que dan el mismo argumento en cada comentario para refutar que es un F ,entp
she showed so much Ne  especially in the scene where she tried to see why eren was talking to himself infront of the mirror,entp
Hange is such an accurate representation of ENTP   her Ne can be quite overwhelming though  I don t know whether these examples of Hange s inferior Si have ever been discussed here  If you ve read the manga  in chapter     she was reminded of how the current situation is very similar to that of Sannes  She said   Even if we intended on doing the right thing    the times change  and we re the ones in the cell    quite Fe Si  Stress makes you recall those experiences  She remembered this somewhere in season   part   also  She wanted to run away from her responsibilities to feel safe and stable for once   reflects wing   too  She feels lost in season    having very low confidence on her decisions  Ne wasn t oozing out the way it used to in previous seasons    P S  Hange s contributions are often overshadowed because of her enthusiasm for titans  She is highly underrated  My admiration for my own type isn t narcissism after all  lol ,entp
Such an amazing character  They are definitely my favorite    ,entp
dm pls  i look like a titan too,entp
the way she gets so excited when she can use something for her science is so adorable please ,entp
godgodgodgodgodgodgodgodgodgodgodgodgodgod,entp
literally the most ne ti i ve ever seen,entp
Rip Sawney and Bean  they would have loved to read the attack on titan manga,entp
Hadn t it been the care of a dedicated Si dom  an overly enthusiastic Ne dom  who s also type    wouldn t have survived  Hange and Moblit are literal opposites of each other function wise or enneatype wise  like two sides of the same coin ,entp
my comfort character           ,entp
She s dead    Peter Parker,esfj
If an owl became human  I love her so much,esfj
love her i think it s funny to see her relationship with her daughter  who is an ENFJ,esfj
My dad s sister who acts like she s the backbone of the family because she owns a         company  I hate her ,esfj
Not sure but I think she s an evil ENFJ  I don t want to get to know her better  She s horrible to my mom if given the chance and so is her dick of a husband  Entitled as hell and God forbid you not be a Marxist like her or she will never let you hear the end of her moralizing  finger pointing  and insults   Everything that can go wrong with Fe  plus the high and mighty Miss Moral Authority      do not recommend   Honestly I don t know how my cousin  thankfully  came out as a normal and more laid back INFJ  with those two for parents  but she did  Probably Grandma and Grandpa s influence ,esfj
She annoys me a little but she s cool,esfj
My aunt is the most reckless  crazy and violent person I have ever met,esfj
Mom s older sister     ESTP  w  Mom s older sister     ISTJ  w  Mom s younger sister  ESFJ  w  Dad s younger sister     ENFP  w   I made her take an enneagram test and she already typed herself   Dad s younger sister     ESTP  w ,esfj

 ari chan     arigato grande  bad idea ,esfj
I really hope one day joji and her make something together   pinkseasontrack ,esfj
To all saying she s an Fe dom bc she reflects her environment  don t you consider this to Se users since they re highly attuned to their surroundings  Might be the reason behind her  phases  ,esfj
after watching her on the voice i saw a lot of fe but haven t seen si   se in her yet tbh  so im voting ENFJ for now  can anyone give me examples of si   also any arguments for her enneagram  ,esfj
If she is a Fe Dom  then she s extremely unhealthy  Also  don t forget the donut incident  https   www youtube com watch v IJBSZE ie Y,esfj
why  w    also i m almost set on ESFJ from explanations i ve seen  but  ,esfj
Ariana is the representation of ESFJ  like Taylor  I don t imagine her with another type,esfj
The problem with ESFJ is that ESFJs don t value Se but Ariana seems to value Se  Also I see some signs of Fi but not as strong as Se so I think Se dom  The thing that you all call Fe might just be enneagram   qualities   s usually get mistyped as Fe doms ,esfj
The thing you call Fe in her might be just Fi and E   E  makes people look like they have Fe,esfj
Whichever type she is  her Se can t be ignored  She s not ESFJ just because she s social and cares about her fans  lol,esfj
edit  some explanations on her subtypes on replies  and also a nice explaination by someone else why tohru is an sx so     tohru is an SEI fe for sure  i also see ESE cz she doesn t seem socio ne suggestive plus she may seem fe base  but shes SEI for these reasons  she actually fits si base better tbh  btw her fe ego is so strong  Also te polr makes more sense and fi demonstrative and se ignoring   si base  A strong ability to recognize internal physical states in themselves and others  to understand how these states are reached  and to recreate and avoid these physical states   Individuals who possess Si as a base function are drawn to situations that satisfy their inner physical experience  Whenever Si base function individuals are taking part in something that involves recognizing  recreating  or analyzing physical states  they feel a great deal of personal power and enthusiasm   Si leading types are constantly adjusting themselves to their environment  which includes the people around them   and rarely have any fixed ideas about what is  appropriate  to desire in a given situation  Thus they are willing to accommodate other people s needs in an ad hoc manner  It is enough for something to  feel right  for them to justify doing it  This behavior may seem random to outside observers  since it is concomitant with weak Ni   fe ego  The person is sensitive to the emotional atmosphere around him  either from an individual  or a group  or even from inanimate objects such as the landscape  the state of the physical environment he happens to be in  or his own emotional associations with the place or people around him  A positive emotional atmosphere is essential for his sense of well being and inner peace  and he either tries to promote it himself by directly influencing it around him  or by simply moving away from the environment or the people causing a negative emotional environment in his view  For the SEI  this takes an on the spot aspect and is reflected in cracking jokes  trying to make people laugh  or simply moving away from people he perceives as affecting him negatively    this suits tohru more tbh  compare her to kagura and momiji an ESE   source is wikisocion archive btw ,esfj
MAJOR S  SPOILER        why is her second highest ENFJ  where is her Ni  She ALWAYS uses what her mom says and completely bases all of her actions from her past  She decides using from what she knows from her past instead of what shes really feeling in her guts  Like when she completely disregarded her own personal beliefs when Hatori called for something in S   she disregarded her gut feeling and followed what she has been told in the past  ENFJs want to be secure for their future  and not just at the moment like her  She barely thinks when Kyo asked her to move in with him when she knows it ll be really hard to live with him especially in such a rush  She trusts her beliefs instead of actually planning thoroughly  I dont think i need to argue for Fe because it s obvious  This might just be a self projection cause shes my highest kin but i genuinely believe shes Fe Si  and if shes not  it s definitely Si Fe or ISFJ ,esfj
A great kin of mine     she touches my heart in unexplainable ways  I hope I could be someone as kind as her  Si is too strong  tbh I still wonder if she could be an ISFJ ,esfj
she has nicely developed ne as well,esfj
she is definitely one of my favourite type   anime characters  tohru is frequently unsettled when her friends dispute  and she makes every effort to restore peace  the characters in the show are drawn to her because of her nurturing and kind personality  and she makes a lot of friends  also discussing her mbti despite the fact that the si dominant arguments  i believe is the source of her motivations  perceptions  and past experiences is from a fe dominant function and i don t believe her ti usage is her tertiary function,esfj
Hands down to one of the best  and accurate  representations of an ESFJ in animes  She s just so healthy  even with her effed background  which makes me admire her even more   every function perfectly attuned to each other  Such an inspirational character  best girl ,esfj
fe is so obviously higher than si ,esfj
Why not phlegmatic melancholic ,esfj
She has a really sweet and bright hearted combination  which inspires me as a person  you know  the thing most Fi users would say     She has all the functions balanced  so it might be difficult to sort out if she has inferior Ti or Ne  But I believe for her case is that she s an ESFJ  Apart from always holding on to and consistently stabilizing her connection with her mother  I can t see any other examples that prove that she has Ne inf and I think her Ne is a bit more prominent than her Ti and so is her Fe  I think an ISFJ will be more assertive with their inner logical principles  while Tohru tends to be more worried and attached to the people around her than an ISFJ would  She s proof that an ESFJ is actually much better than most people in this community thought their was    I believe she s   fix rather than   because she cares more about support than increasing experience unlike most other protagonists  Truly an angel in human form  ,esfj
dont have any grandparents now   of them died before i was even born one of them died when i was   year old and my grandma died   months ago i didnt know her much but she had a lot of Fe in her im there minding my own buisness and suddenly my mom said to me out loud have you said hello  my grandma said  let him be he enjoys his time alone so why are you bothering him   i show no emotions on my face but everytime she knew if im happy angry sad or scared without me even talking,esfj
Screams ESTJ,esfj
Definitely ISFJ  Very caring but closed minded about some stuff  I really love her  she s constantly trying to protect me  my brother and my cousin from the menaces of this world  She seeks approvation and she helps everyone in her town  to the point that my grandpa tries to contain this behaviour  even if he s an altruist too   I only hope she tries to develop a bit better her inferior Ne  she doesn t create problems  but that would be even better ,esfj
my grandma totally escapes the stereotype of a grandma fe Dom  she is total If Dom   she is always looking for encouragement brusque and assertive if she wasn t evangelical these days she would definitely take her grandchildren to the pub ,esfj
Both of my grandmothers are xSFJ  s  Very loving and passionate but you do not want to cross them under any circumstances ,esfj
her fi n sp blind are so annoying,esfj
she likes to drink and party with her friends  even though shes quiet  she has a very strong Fi and has not yet developed her Te inf  she is not seen as the ideal kind of mother and as the opposite of my maternal grandmother  ESFJ   btw i love herrrr  ,esfj
bad b tch,esfj
i feel bad for my grandma   my mom thinks shes a bit annoying because she talks too much or she gets emotional too much    ,esfj
Weird thing my paternal granny is ISFJ and maternal is ESFJ  while here in most it s opposite lol,esfj
I literally watched the first   minutes of a  min video and instantly knew she was ENFJ  Here are some quotes  all taken from the video   Use each as the other s context      It s actually super super cool to see people relate to my songs      I  like  am on a set all day with  like  a bunch of  like     year old dudes  Like  is what I say going to resonate with other people my age    And so  putting out Driver s License and seeing people of actually all ages  male  female  everyone  sort of being like   Whoa  like  that took me back to a time where I was feeling like that   or   Oh  I m feeling like this right now  This helped me so much   Like that was so cool to me to realize that  you know  honesty is always relatable  And you don t have to like try to relate to  like  large audiences  You just have to tell your story because  you know  humans are all so much more alike than we are different  And we re all feeling so much of the same things that we just don t talk about    She literally SCREAMS Fe Ni  ENFJs are more likely than ESFJs to try to place everyone in a box and view humanity as one big picture and aging as slowly moving farther away to get a better look Their Ni makes them more individualistic and creative than Si  this is what a few people are reading as Ne Fi    Ni is insightful and Si is pragmatic  Just because she wrote a breakup song doesn t mean she values Si    N is insightful and Si is pragmatic  Ni is linked to observation  idealism and insight and is drawn to the Internet and things that challenge intellect which is why she once said something like   I m actually quite the introvert  I like being alone     As an INFP  trust me  I can identify an ENFJ  I m on the run from one rn   ,esfj
From what I could find when looking into Olivia Rodrigo s personality  ENFJ seems to be the best fit for her  From the interviews and articles I looked over  her being an Fe dom and Ni aux makes most sense  Here s a few quotes that back up the idea of her leading with Fe      We re so much more alike than we are different  At the core of it all  we re all feeling the same feelings of fear and sadness and loneliness and happiness and love       A hard thing for me to grapple with when this whole thing started happening is just  anyone can say anything       On making people feel included regarding beauty standards   I think representation is all about adding  I don t think it s about taking anything away from anyone       Sometimes when you have a lot of success really quickly  it can scare people and make people feel different  That was an interesting thing to learn  I m figuring it all out       Every single artist is inspired by artists who have come before them  It s sort of a fun  beautiful sharing process    As for her Ni  I see her comfort with the unknown and the theoretical as ample evidence of the functions prioritization  as she doesn t seek familiarity or predictability in the world around her  but rather an singular abstracted vision of what is to come  Also  one video I d recommend to observe her comfort with discussing the abstract over the tangible is her discussion with singer Alanis Morisette  who is an INFJ respectively  Aside from the video mentioned  here are some quotes that back up the idea that she has auxiliary Ni      I always wanted to grow up because I feel you get better with age and figure out who you are  I feel like I get happier as I get older       I m no different from any other    year old out there  I m definitely going to make a lot of mistakes in my life and in my career probably too  That s just life       It s interesting  heartbreaks when you re    or     because you don t yet have that perspective of knowing that life goes on and you re gonna meet other people  that it wasn t the only happy experience you ll ever have       You can create your own reality sometimes with social media  What you see just becomes your reality  and it s totally not at all      The Guardian   Rodrigo is not sad to leave this part of her life behind   Resounding no   she says  Nostalgia isn t her style    Overall  from what I could find  ignoring her music and only looking into the content of her words in interviews  I think it s fair to conclude that Olivia is most likely an ENFJ  Also  for anyone interested  I have more quotes listed on my site  which is a work in progress at the moment  The link to that is in the bio of my profile  Hope the quotes provided help ,esfj
can the ESFJ voters please give some arguments for Si and Ne that aren t from her lyrics  | because olivia works with co writers and her songwriting style hasn t completely developed into her own yet  she is very clearly influenced by taylor swift  who actually is a Si user  in terms of her songwriting and i just don t think it s a reliable way of typing her  maybe when she s a bit older and has grown more as a songwriter we will start to see more idiosyncrasies in her songwriting but as of now  in her particular case  i don t think Si influences in her lyrics are a particularly strong argument ,esfj
A lot of people are saying to not type based on her lyrics  but I disagree  I think it s wrong to only consider her lyrics  but we do have to take a look into her art because the way she expresses her feelings says a lot about her   If I had to pick one song to explain why I think she s a two it would be  enough for you   The overall idea of the lyrics expresses that she wants to be loved  appreciated  and enough for this person  When she says she knows about the coffee  favorite songs  and books this person likes she s saying  look all the things I did for you  look how I m dedicated to you  and you still left me   Later on  in these lyrics  she expresses this by saying  don t you think I loved you too much to be used and discarded     s believe they have to give in order to receive love  acts of service   and they expect love or appreciation when they give their time to someone   On Sour  as a type    we see Olivia disintegrate to an   in  Good   u    Enough for you    Deja Vu   and integrate to a   in  Hope ur okay    Drivers License    Traitor    Favorite crime   its not that simple  there are a lot of  ish and  ish vibes to all this songs  ,esfj
Copied and pasted my argument from a while ago since now it s a bit of a pain to scroll all the way down  for everyone who still considers her an ESFJ  i d appreciate it if you d take the time to read my explanations and if you have any questions  id be happy to answer     Asked about a day ago where people saw Ne  but apparently there is only really flawed arguments for Si  so i d like to add my take and if you guys have any opinions on why she s an Si Ne user  please let me know  This is a copy and paste from a previous comment that i posted btw    Where do you see Ne  She does not seem to expand on ideas  IMO  and seems to really be focused on viewing the world through an objective and external point of view rather than subjectively  Focused on the experience of others  rather than her own  I think people automatically assume she s a Si user because of her lyrics  but that does not pertain to who she is true  I do not see her having Ne although if you re strong on that idea  id love examples   I can list some examples  Se is the best function I recognize bc it s one of my favorites to spot  Se is focused on the external emergent experience  and looks at the experience that is given to other people  are they comfortable in your presence  what is going on around you  how are people reacting to what you re currently doing  etc    i was dancing my a ss off to all the songs  and i was dancing so hard that my braids were hitting people in the face so there was like a circle of nobody around me because nobody wanted me to be hit by me because i was losing my mind so much    Se statement  explaining how she gave others an experience through external sensory stimuli    I really was just writing about my personal experience  and I wrote that during a time where I was so consumed with how I looked on social media  and how people perceive me    INFP shadow  The entire interview here shows Ni Se  along with Fe Ti and she does not seem to expand on the questions but rather compresses her points into a singular idea of why she did certain things and most importantly sticking to the point of the question instead of venturing off to other topics  Ni       child functions are very much recognizable  i m her age and my Ti is extremely noticeable and even my inferior function is starting to really develop  It s the function that energizes us so we love to use it  I d see her Ne more  but I simply cannot spot it   other interesting quotes i think about from her     I m a very in the present song writer  I write songs when I m in the depths of my emotions    Se statement  takes action towards an idea as soon as it comes to mind  Pretty Ni Se to me  Ni Se works in a way where when an idea is presented  it likes to go to work and go  hm i want to do this  and create that idea into fruition    it doesn t necessarily have to relate to a romantic relationship  I think I feel inadequate in many sort of relationships whether that s a work relationship or a friendship relationship  I think you can sort of apply it to anything  i think those feelings of not being enough for someone is something that we all feel so intensely in every sort of relationship     Fe Ti but can also be viewed as Se Statement since she goes into a comparison about how everyone objectively feels the same way sometimes about certain relationships and the experience of others  Let me know what y all think  I know Fe and Se can be confusing functions since they can be so similar  Fe is good at understanding the values of others and implementing it towards social settings  which we see very frequently on how she acts around and easily makes people comfortable  and Se is very much recognized because she is fixated on the experience she gives others  if she makes them comfortable  in an objective social setting  She does not seem to be an Ne user  she doesnt necessarily go from topic to topic or expand her mind  ask  what if  questions  etc ,esfj
Girlfriend materiel right here,esfj
ESFJ  w  is my nightmare pairing ,esfj
the thing with olivia is as much as i love her it s hard knowing what part of her personality is her true self and what part is her brand  like if we were typing by brand i would say ESFJ IXFP  w  because of the edgy and relatable persona   all i know is that her Fe is brighter than the sun   in all honesty  i find it hard to see her as a  w  over a  w  but the arguments for  w  are good  it s just in her interviews she doesn t seem like a  w  yk  and aren t type   s main focus their individuality  she s marketing herself as relatable and just like everyone else  wouldn t this be the last thing a  w  would want   also melancholic in temperament   i feel like people forget what melancholic temperament actually is  it s not just about being sad  although i am open to arguments about her being a sanguine melancholic it just doesn t make sense from what the public has seen of her yet ,esfj
I m really surprised to see that there aren t many ppl considered her as  w  or at least put it in her tritype ,esfj
I m very sure she s a high sp    read my lower posts  but I m not sure which exact stacking  Could we have the discussion about her IV  I m not sure about sp sx tbh it just seems more plausible than sp so bc of the vibe she gives off in music  But seeing her off stage I do get more sp so vibes  Why have some of you voted so sp  w  ,esfj
Her passion for engaging with her physical world helping the people around her  actively showing concern for putting things into action   that she should be like those courageous birds that spread their wings and flew into the blue skies  instead of waiting for directions   and her big goal to be the best Outrider  It was mentioned in her lore that she only truly became part of the Outriders having lived through the disappearance of her grandfather  She took on the challenge with confidence and courage and nothing else  determined to not disappoint her grandfather and to also find out where he had gone  She s always had the burning enthusiasm to smash through obstacles and does whatever it takes in spite of any external influence  which made her quite the troublemaker back then   My case for Amber s possible Se Fi  D,esfj
her involvement in the dragonspine quest just clarified ESFJ for me even further    being reminded of her grandfather when playing with joel  wanting to  make him proud  by being a great outrider  fe si     still don t see fi  because she is always compensating for the objective emotions of the people around her,esfj
She is FAR more likely to be an enneagram three with a strong two wing  She cares a lot about being the best version of herself and places an excessive amount of attention on her competence  even more than a two  Having a one fix adds on to that even more lmao,esfj
I only played the game  But all the bird s tale and flying exam gave me SiNe vibes   Edit  Wouldn t she be a    Always she wants to get another adventure to get more achievements  Also she is always talking about how competenent is as a flyer  i don t remember if this is the word   And always saying like  I m a knight    I m a knight   knowing that it s a achievement which represents importance  also when her image is not valued as she desires she gets upset lmao  She doesn t want to feel loved or desired  she wants everyone to see how capable she is  But I think she has a wing   because she s really oriented to people   Edit    WE DID IT  WUUU,esfj
hi i m scared of genshin pdb pages so if you disagree please be civil ty  D i think amber is ESFP  i honestly don t see how she uses si  she doesn t seem to overlay her surroundings with her subjective impressions like si users do  rather she is extremely present oriented and seems to take in her surroundings objectively like an se user  i don t think that her being dutiful and following rules necessarily means she s a high si user  because that s not really what si is about  if there s any evidence of her si usage i d love to see it  but i m not convinced yet  i also don t see clear fe usage from her but i d love to hear some more explanations  andddd btw i would like to write a detailed explanation of why i think amber is ESFP but i ve been rlly busy so i won t have much time in the coming weeks    but hopefully i can compile it soon hhhhh i m just posting this bc i want to know what people think about her supposed Fe Si,esfj
I ll give my opinion based on what I saw in the game  and  cause I main her for no reason lol   She is clearly a Si User  we can define this function such as gathering empirical information to use it  making decisions or knowing what to do in a situation based on our experiencies and information that we store  She use a diary to note important aspects in her life to guide her in the present  like in her mission where recurs of the flight instructor book  also she tends to be traditional and use teachings to improve herself  which also explain her    an enneagram that can be common in any type   I know that in that specific mission  the final  awnser  to overcome the issue was  self will   but wasn t her first option at all  Si   Fi  This can arguable if you want   So then  abou her Fe  in this case she s very attached Mondstadt s justice  being helpful and kindy with the new travellers  also her need to being recognized by others is way to explain it because Fe also is focus on what may people will see about us and how can we exceed or meet their expectations  Not saying that she doesn t use Fi  even if she is a fictional character  we can use all functions but in differents ways   Irrelevant  but in one of her phrases say that she doesn t like the riddles  so can be a Inf Ti because this function refers find an answer and analyze it    I don t see her like ESFP just for her spontaneous and charming personality  I see this definition more like a stereotype for ESFPs when is more related to her tritype  If someone disagree  you re free to comment  I have her barely in lvl    ,esfj
I find the current consensus a bit funny because  everyone  agrees Amber is an ESFJ but they don t go out of their way to verbally defend ESFJ typing until the  self absorbed  ESFP voters  might  get the majority  Then  when ESFJ voters become defensive  enneagram and votes in other systems are getting questioned   To add fuel to the fire  Amber constantly breaks the gliding rules but aced the gliding tests first try every time  She s flipping confident in her flying ability   EDIT  OMG what about ESTP  Like I m not the first person to mention it but that Fe is so strong  but not like controlling how she presents herself or anything  Amber loves action  She s practically a free spirit   But then I d have to explain to ESTP simps that Amber is not their idealized ESTP girlfriend stereotype ,esfj
Type  s want to be admired and to impress others  which is something Amber strives to do   Amber s goal is to become a great the best Outrider  and is determined to reach her goal  Ex  Amber personally experienced this entire episode  having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began  With the decline of her squad  she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life  No longer her carefree former self  she was filled with a new determination  She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible  no matter what it took   From Character Story     Type  s also work to  be the best that they can be   which she displays  Ex   For sure  I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors  But one day  I m gonna be the best Outrider ever    From Character Story     Amber works extremely hard to become the best  seeks to constantly improve herself  and puts in a lot of effort to achieve her goals  while comparing herself to others   which is a trait that many Type  s have  Ex   I met a strange outlander today  I was suspicious at first  but as it turns out  this outlander is both reliable and capable  Ugh  come to think of it  what would I do if an enemy that strong showed up     I mustn t fall behind  I must train harder     In addition  she is extremely competitive and constantly challenges the Traveller to friendly competitions  Although this may not be a trait all  s possess    Amber still helps people and is extremely friendly  caring  and kind  Also  she doesn t have too much of a desire to express herself  and more of to be loved from what I ve seen  This personally makes me believe that she is more of a  w  than a  w  ,esfj
Why    Just curious  she kinda struck me more as a  ,esfj
Look  i actually don t think Amber is enneagram   or    Amber does not match the motivations and fears of enneagram   or      Enneagram  s are afraid of feeling bad and not having anything to occupy themselves with  They look for fun things to keep themselves busy to avoid negative emotions  They are adventurous and fun  Their main motivation is to be free and do fun things  But I don t see any of these features in Amber  Yes  she s energetic and fun  but she doesn t keep herself busy to avoid negative emotions  Her main purpose is not to have fun  It actually fits her a little bit  but I don t think that s her actual enneagram  Maybe because   is in her tritype    The main fear of Enneagram   is not being loved  They have a hard time saying no because they think they won t be liked if they say no  They care a lot about their relationships and like to help people  They understand people s needs and deal with their problems  They are afraid of not being loved  Amber is helpful  but she s not afraid of not being loved  Being helpful makes her a good person  not enneagram      The main desire of Enneagram   is to be the best at something and to stand out with this success  The biggest fear of the three is to lose something  They are competitive and collaborative  Amber wants to stand out with her achievements  She is constantly voicing that she is the Mondstadt Gliding Champion  Being the  st and always talking about it  wanting to express her successes  being collaborative is totally enneagram    She is also in competition with traveler  She wants to prove she s the best in gliding  How can it be   or   when her main desire is to achieve and stand out with her achievements    Also i m not so sure about her iv  I thought it might be sx   but i m not entirely sure  Anyone have any ideas ,esfj
I kinda see Fe and Ne  not very much Si  So could he be an ESFJ in a Fe Ne loop ,esfj
his Se dominant even scares,esfj
Annoying dude but I still love him idc  I see the Fe and Ne,esfj
WHY IS HE TYPED AS AN ESFJ WHAAAR    he literally has so much Se and he barely even uses Fe   Si    how do people think that he s an ESFJ  did we watch the same show      ,esfj
Definitely a Fe dom  I get it that some people may think of him as an ESFP  because he s sometimes not that skilled with responding to others people s emotional needs   cough  Diane  cough    but MBTI has never been about people s skill but about their preferance of approaching the world  Te doms may fail  Ti doms may not notice some logical inconstencies in their reasoning  Fe dom may not please every person on a planet   That being said  he clearly sacrifices his own values to please other people  we could see that during the presidential campaign   I agree that Fi users can be people pleasers  but their mechanism differs  When Fi user performs they usually focus on expressing themselves and the public liking their performance is just a side benefit  while Fe users will primarily focus on appeasing the public   I m much less sure about other functions  I guess his Si manifests in his preferance for tried and tested methods of appeasing people and literal understanding of other people s needs  again the Diane s ball room case  as opposed to more metaphorical approach of Ni users  I m much more certain about his Ne  which is shown during his interactions with Todd ,esfj
YEP YEP HE IS Fe DOM NOT Se DOM THANK YOU,esfj
wtf are yall smoking this man is not a Fe dom  he is driven by what is in the moment  he likes to feel good and his whole philosophy on life is  have fun because youre going to die eventually   having Fi doesnt mean you can t care about others  he struggles to properly read people and simply follows his own views of what would make him happy and tries to apply it to other people   which is his main conflict with diane ,esfj
He has obvious Fe Si Ne  He romanticizes life and the need to be liked more than anything else  He is a little more centered than Brett from Inside Job  but they have resemblances in the way they handle opportunities with the main objective of maintaining harmony and having external approval above anything else   He is the first one to throw himself into a social situation blindly and search for how he can be useful in a practical  yet majority viewed spot  He doesn t do it for himself or his dreams  or for the need for fame  he genuinely is intertwined with everyone else and feels useless without them  He is a Yes Man in that regard  He will go along with anything  but not because he seeks Se Fi authenticity  He is a huge people pleaser ,esfj
This guy just live the moment  in the world of the fleeting pleasures  Once he said to Diane to think less about the future and the things and just live one day after other,esfj
Ok  this opinion might be wrong  because i haven t seen SU in a long time but there s something that kinda bothers me  Isn t cognitive function theory supposed to explain cognitive process instead of behavior    I see a lot of comments about how in the first season he showed Ne because his functions were not fully develop  But for me that does not make sense  function theory explains the mind  not the traits  in contrast with the enneagram that is about the mask we put in front of society  cognitive function is about a  true self  and in chilhood we can see it more crearly because we are pages in blank  idyllic we behave as we are  So with this logic  i am conscious that i am saying we cant type anyone because we are not in their minds  also this is a character from a cartoon  that was not my point  i just dont know how to express in english  lol   what i wanted to say is that all the process behind Steven actions seems ENFP to me  but i am not makin a vote until i rewatch the show  who knows when this is going to happen  to be sure   And can someone explain me if it is theorycally possible to show a function as a kid but being not a domintant user of that function  I mean i can see situations where that happens  like if the parents reject or punish their kids for showing certain behaviors and they have to pretend but i dont think thats the case of Steven    Feel free to correct my english grammar mistakes  i suck at the language and i want to improve ,esfj
Why     instead of     for his tritype  I feel like he could be more  w  than type  ,esfj

 J TAKE   Steven is probably ENFP and his Fe is overrated as        his Fi being Underrated  For the past half year of looking at this page the only reasoning I ve been seeing for Fe is the fact that he s a Sweet Empath Boi   Steven Universe Future Plot and how the ENFP voters are just using stereotypes   Steven is pretty Subjective Judgement   Objective Judgement  Examples being The Entire Season   and his anger against Garnet and Pearl for not telling him the truth tho I d even claim it s existent throughout the entire show   Ne   Fi can be Empathetic as all      as well  Throughout the show most of his Choices are decided based off what he wants and feels the only factor is those desires are usually concerned with People rather then Things  His friends and the Crystal Gems for example   Steven is Idealistic Optimistic and Protective with the personality of an Explorer and He s more Individualistic than people give him credit for   All I ll say cause I wanna take a break from this site   I m more interested in Big   and Enneagram then MBTI  Comment if you disagree and don t just leave a random Downvote please  Thank you,esfj
such a clear fe dom  the way he just bottled everything up in fear of how everyone would think of him when he revealed his unhealthy state was exuding fe  one of my favourite ESFJs seeing his break down was so heart warming when everyone gave him all those comforting words and him getting the attention he deserved after suffering in silence so much  he s not perfect but that s exactly why i love him  ,esfj
Why are there SO MANY ENFP votes where do any of you guys see lead Ne    Anyways  I was wondering why     fix  Like why          Also why Sanguine  Dominant  Sanguine Phlegmatic  He seems very easy going and peaceful and tries to maintain a calm vibe in his atmosphere ,esfj

Guardians  SJ  are by far the most common MBTI category    is the most common enneagram among the guardians  with   being the second most common overall after    SFJ is slightly more common than STJ as well  with approximately    percent of the human population being either ESFJ or ISFJ  compared to the roughly    percent that are XSTJ  Humans overall are social creatures that operate in civilized societies centered around traditions and contributing to the shared group system  Si and Fe  Extroversion is rewarded more in societies than introversion   Humans naturally wish to care and help out their own and form tribes based on shared history  culture  ethnicity  and interests  Traditions are sometimes altered or changed to fit a group consensus  such as how religious or societal doctrines have adapted to now allow for marginalized people who used to be viewed as second class citizens to have equal access to certain rights such as voting and marriage  So despite being fewer in number than ISFJs  I feel like humanity as a collective values ESFJ mentalities  Fe collectivism over Si familiarity   Humans follow trends based on what others around them  usually family or close friends  like and enjoy  Consumer spending habits show that humans cling to the popular and the familiar  and they shy away from the untested or the unpopular   For enneagram  I believe   dominates all areas of society  but especially established sectors such as business  law  academia  and medicine   w  is more likely to blend in and succeed in a human society by sheer nature of their extroversion and desires to socialize and have fun   Of course this is just a generic assumption based on what appears to be the most common  Some societies especially those in Europe and Asia operate on Te Si mentality instead  striving for efficiency  improving on what already exists  and producing tangible and successful results   Si types with Te and Fe are the most likely to thrive in most societies  but Ni types that have strong Te and Fe  like ENXJs  can also make effective use of their Ni and their dominant judging function to adapt  P types typically find smaller niches in society and are more likely to specialize  such as SPs typically focusing on aesthetics  entertainment  or sports  J types are far more uniform and generalized  and you will typically find SJs in just about any industry or sector  Society unfortunately does not really help out NP types too well  Humanity values Fe  Te  Si  and occasionally Ni and Se  Most world leaders and celebrities are a Guardian  and the few that aren t typically have a strong Fe or Te function that allows them to compensate   Ne  Ti  and Fi are often viewed as the  black sheep  functions  Many NPs are offbeats and often cannot succeed as well in human society since the functions we use are relatively incompatible and unrelatable to the majority  The most unemployed types are INFP  ENFP  INTP  and ENTP  with ESFP and ISFP also being up there  Again  we would rather bear to our drums and follow where our logic or hearts guide us and on possibilities over the established and the norms  Humanity is somewhat robotic and worker bee esque  picking a traditional role or function based on what is needed or popular in society  like law or medicine  We would rather pick what works for us  what we are passionate about  and that does not always translate well into employability ,esfj

Can people explain how is he a core     And that too Social    Just because he is very efficiency and precision oriented doesn t automatically equate him with     All the time that I have seen him wanting external validation was from some particular person authority figure and not just looking good through efficiency like  s usually are concerned with   For him  it really sounds like he just wants to have certainty ultimately through establishing external reference points and establishing complete belief in them as a way of gaining security   So Social Six can also really fit him    The Social Six can also be very idealistic  structuring life through the adherence to high ideals  This is a character who holds tight to ideologies and a particular view of things as a way of feeling safe    His view of considering Eldians as something bad was completely shaken after his conversation with Eren which lead him to panic so much as his ideology and belief was questioned    The Social Six typically represents a mixture of phobic and counterphobic expressions  This Six is a cooler character that the Self Preservation Six  They find safety in being precise about how one should conduct oneself  They have a lot of anticipatory anxiety they believe that everything will go wrong  so they rely on precision in following the rules as a way of coping with their anxiety  They feel most secure when they have clear minds and when things are in clear categories  Social Sixes are good Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts  dedicated to adhering to the group code and to a competent way of doing things based on that code     But I am open to arguments here and willing to change my vote    Edit   I thought about it more and I think now that Social  w  fits him pretty well  I wasn t that knowledgeable on enneagram before so maybe that s why I misunderstood  Obviously   as a fix is definitely there for him ,esfj

Mine s really talkative  noisy  and witty  She really knows how to get along with people and accompany their needs  She keeps me stabilized  myself could never  I literally forget to eat meals sometimes   When we talk  she generates a bunch of random ideas and random jokes and I keep the conversation on a straight path  I really love my mom  we re quite the opposite but are similar at the same time     ,esfj
i love my mom so much jdkdkd,esfj
this explains why we get along extremely well   she became really warm and sweet with time but still has difficulties managing how to say things  very direct and straightforward  raised me and my brother not to be kind but independent and self sufficient yet never neglect the importance of emotions  ilysm mom   ,esfj

Come on guys  I know my girl sakura  she is clearly an Fe user  she always cared about people in the whole story  remember when naruto turned into   tails and lost his control  when sakura saw him turned into a monster  she cried and jump to save him   naruto stop    and then she gets hurt from him  BUT when he back and ask to sakura  how you hurt  She tells  Oh that s nothing  orochimaru did this  She hide the fact and what he did  to protect naruto s feelings  also remember ino s words  sakura always hide her feelings  She really is fe user  if you truly know her you will see there is no way she be a thinker ,esfj
Since this argument is almost always used by ESFJ voters I wanted to say it again     Sakura did not hate Naruto because everyone does  nor did she love Sasuke because every girl did    She used to  hate  Naruto because he always pick on her  tho it s because he has a crush on her but she doesn t know  and makes it harder for her to get closer to Sasuke  And the reason why she like Sasuke is unknown but we know  because it s stated black on white  that she didn t know he was popular when her crush started ,esfj
         i want to clarify that the ESTJ arguments are not baseless   make a lot of sense  it is very understandable where everyone is coming from regarding this stance  however i ultimately believe that sakura DOES value fe over te and it is her conflicting personality  due to the stereotypical shaky writing of women in shounen  that is creating the skepticism regarding her being a fe dom      sakura in part      i think we should take into consideration that in both the original series and shippuden  she is an immature teenager and like another commentator mentioned  it would be inaccurate to assume that she is a healthy individual  before boruto atleast   furthermore  sakuras impulsive personality and initial disregard toward naruto do not necessarily indicate inferior fi  i think it is all the more reason behind how sakura values public opinion and collective judgments over objective rationalisation  naruto was isolated and shunned by the whole village  he was the underdog whom no one paid attention to whereas sasuke  from the very beginning  was revered by almost everyone around him  girls had a crush on him  boys envied him  enemies wished to fight him  teachers praised him  and sasukes status as the cool mysterious boy was the very basis of sakuras affection toward him  she did not see anything in him that was of individualistic opinion nor was her crush on him a product of a means to an end  she just subconsciously followed the trend and pattern that she was witnessing    alongside her opinion of sasuke being reliant on the overall attitude of everyone toward him  her behavior toward naruto was also a result of something similar  she saw that everyone considered him bratty  annoying  and irrelevant  and was influenced into believing the same  in episode    when sasuke is mean to her and calls her annoying  it is then that she starts to empathise with naruto and regrets being rude to him  fe guiding her alongside tertiary ne       im annoying  thats what he said  now i get it  this is how naruto must feel  i shouldnt treat him like that  next time i see him im going to be nice    i do agree that what she said about naruto being an orphan was messed up but we cannot take that argument at face value for why she is not a fe user  remember that she was only around    at that time and the aforementioned reasoning could have contributed to why she behaved like that  besides  lets not forget that fe users can also say awful things  that statement on its own is way too vague to determine that she is a high te user or has a low feeling function in her function stack   even during the test that kakashi gave team   a while later  sakura was too busy caring about what sasuke was doing and whether he was in an okay state or not  to even focus on the task  ud think that a te dom would be slightly more concentrated on the factual reality of what was happening rather than being so obliviously invested in another person  who himself was ironically just wrapped up in winning the test     another one of the conclusive justifications i saw in the comments for sakura being ESTJ was that shes not very empathetic and disregards emotional values when making decisions and i wholly disagree  in as early as the initial episodes of the series  sakura is shown to connect with others through compassion and understanding  in episode     an annoyed sakura immediately begins to tear up upon seeing a poor child and quickly offers them something  letting go of the irritable mood she was in a few seconds ago  again  a minute later after tazuna quickly goes over the negative impact gato has had over the region  sakura slips into worry and wishes for her   her team to help them     continued in comments  ,esfj
imagine thinking sakura is a Te dom  i could never,esfj
ISFP sakura is fi te  all her motivations are for herself  for self fulfillment and she s fi dom not te dom not ESTJ ,esfj
She is kind and considerate of others doesn t necessarily mean Fe dom  And what in the world Ti inf  I actually see more Te dom though  She is very pragmatic and has sensible approaches to situations  I see it a lot in battle  Si is evident though but in the aux perhaps ,esfj
I want to make a point about the enneagram  I don t think she s a    at all  I don t even think she has   on her tritype  She s either a   or a    most probably a     s help others to gain love  they put aside their needs in order to please others  because they want them to be dependent and love them because they need them  For them  helping is a way of conquering  or seducing people  not necessarilly romantically   Sakura is a good person who likes to help  but she does not use that as way of seduction  she doesn t fixate on that  and she definitively does not put her needs aside for that  I think she is a    She wants guidance and to feel secure  She usually does things  by the book  because of that  Also  most of her arc was about her overcoming her fears and fighting  So yeah  I am aware that my argument for   is not very strong  I m still thinking about it  but I think I can say with some certainty that she is not a     Also  I mentioned this on my later comment  but I m in the watching Shippuden and would really like if no one spoiled me on the replies of anything past the middle point of Shippuden ,esfj
Sakura is Te dom   ESTJ  I don t understand how there are so may ESFJ votes  my bet is that most people are voting from memory and don t really take a look at the character when thinking of the vote  they just go with Fe dom because she cried a lot  But if you really take a look at the character  you understand that she might cry a lot  but when it comes to making decisions  they are rarely based on any kind of emotion  they are detached and based on facts  pragmatism and cause effect  Not to say that ESFJs cannot be pragmatic  but they would pay way more attention to how their actions would line up with the emotional atmosfere of the group  which she never does  And I m not saying that because she was a little mean in the OG Naruto  I m saying that because I really don t recall a single scene where she considered how her decisions would appear  Most of her decisions are based on facts and common sense  not ethics  She is very realistic and pragmatic  Notice that  during fight  while Naruto or Sasuke  high Fi users  go on and fight  most of the times stupidly  I mean  they would be long dead if they weren t extremelly overpowered   like she isn t   she knows that she is not going to get anywhere with her present powers and retreats because that s what makes sense  especially in OG Naruto  She focus on the results of her actions  not necessarily on the action itself  so if she understands that going into fight will most probably kill her and not help anyone  she will not go into fight  Yeah  some fear is involved on that decision  but overall I think it s just being realistic  Later on she starts to take more risks  but I think that s just her inferior Fi getting developed and her love for Sasuke  it s still not related with ethics  So  that s how I see it  just try to watch some scene with her on Naruto  like a fight or something  and try to actually locate the Fe  When you really look at it  you see none  Just try to type besides stereotypes   Also  I want to say that I m still halfway through Shippuden and it would be really cool if you did not spoil what I haven t watched yet while replying yo this ,esfj
Makes more sense wing   than  ,esfj
can someone explain his   fix to me ,esfj
it s so interesting to see how strong his Fe is but yet he still gets uncomfortable when people are emotional around him   also his Se is so well developed,esfj
Why there is   in his tritype tho   I thought   could be more logical  he always seems such a perfectionist when it comes to dance and have such a strong sense of wrong and right ,esfj
can someone explain why  w  and not  w  pls  i m new to enneagram   ,esfj
This isn t really absolute  but could he be a  w   Considering how seriously he takes his image ,esfj
   He uses Se   https   youtu be OK GJ WIQ s  Read the lyrics  He wrote the entire thing  IT TELLS A LOT ABOUT HIM,esfj
I mostly believe he s a  w   He s a great commander and he has a nearly constant care for his  territory   which with his Si makes actually sense  As an    my house and my people need to be under my constant attention  and i feel it s my responsibility to take care of them  I feel that Jhope is really close in that sense  Also he s a scary commander when it s about dance and that s also something really   likes  He s not as carefree as he looks like,esfj
his fe is  like  clear as day i guess but sometimes he s a bit confusing to me because of how uncomfortable he gets when the members try to get emotional with him lol  like taehyung telling him he loves him too much and him saying  please don t   going  was this really necessary  when jimin hugged him  reading a comment where someone said they think about him way too much and just saying  well that s a problem  etc  and how oblivious he is to the other members  affection in general  like  when someone tells him they love him he s just like um alright i guess but can you not what also confused me was on  you know those things they do where they write down things about the other members  the members wrote down ways to annoy jimin and he wrote  tell him he gained weight  and like    a lot of people know about jimin s problems with his weight and how insecure he was about it  right  saying that to someone who doesn t exactly have the healthiest relationship with food is    i don t know  would a fe user be that oblivious  because jimin literally used to pass out because of malnutrition during practice  so there s no way he didn t notice that  or maybe he just doesn t know too well about mental health and it doesn t have to do with functions  idk,esfj
ESFP votes     he s like a second leader to the group as namjoon says and values social harmony so much yeah he is energetic and a dancer but not a se dom     plus he is the best,esfj
Please someone explain why is he a limbic,esfj
SO   doesn t make sense to me  during the   th Chairman arc he just straight up didn t care whether he won or lost and only used it to promote Gon and try to save him  if he is SO first then SO   makes more sense  and if he is a   then SX SP makes more sense,esfj
such a strong fe i can t see anything other than ESFJ,esfj
Leorio DOESN T have self preservation blind  He is too tied to his economic security and he values money  because of his bad experience   Typing Leorio as a so sx it s like forget his whole background  He ISN T a So    He doesn t care about status and he doesn t want to be in the spotlight  He isn t competitive  Social three is the most aggressive among all  s  True social   are Dio Brando  JOJO   Griffith  Berserk   Azula  ATLA  and Naruto  who he is a  w  like Leorio  I still don t get his Instinctual Stacking  He could be a sp so or sp sx  Idk  Probably he is a sp so   Sp     The SP  works hard to achieve a sense of security  both in terms of material and financial resources and has an urge about knowing how to do things effectively and doing things exactly  without failure and error  They express a concern with security in that they have a need to feel autonomous and self  sufficient to know how to take care of themselves and others  This person emanates a sense of security  they are solid people who you might go to for advice  They seem outwardly calm and organized  like they have it all together Sp   wants to believe that they never have been frustrated by their own uselessness or incompetence  but many failures haunt their conscience  These are assertive people who specialize in solving problems and getting things done in a high quality way and while they work very hard  they don t show their stress ,esfj
thinking of that one scene of him and melody     i love me a healthy Fe dom,esfj
Leorio s Fe is blistering  It almost defines his entire character  From the start  Leorio wants to be respected among his peers  He doesn t want to be seen by the group as weak or undervalued  During the second trial  Leorio starts a fight with the elderly woman proctor because he can never decide on sacrificing the life of his hypothetical son or daughter to save the other   he wants to save everyone  Leorio may seem to be materialistic and greedy  but that is him adopting a rich playboy persona that allows him to become more popular and respected by society at large  He knows that many people only want to be Hunters so they can sell the license and make money  Leorio plays by this facade for as long as he can  until Kurapika sees glimmers of his true self  Then and only then does Leorio confess the truth  because he knows he is losing his place in his trio with Gon and Kurapika by keeping up the lie   Underneath the materialism is his humanitarian and noble motivations  Leorio wants to be a Hunter only for the money he needs to become a doctor and treat his patients without them worrying about cost  Leorio understands the Fe mentality that the world is governed by the wealthy  and he wants wealth so he can fulfill his dreams  Leorio ideally wants to treat people for free but be can t so he opts for the next best thing  doing so on his dime  However  Leorio is willing to abandon his dreams for others  He said himself he values his friends over his dream  During the exam  Leorio appeals to Netero to disqualify the former after Killua killed Botoro because he did so to save his life  In Yorkshin  Leorio later tells Kurapika to abandon his personal vengeance because the Phantom Troupe have Gon and Killua hostage  Kurapika wanted to make Chrollo suffer and kill him in the car  but Leorio focuses on what the group needs and that is saving Gon and Killua  Leorio almost sabotages his chances at being a doctor for good by attacking a pro Hunter  Ging  during a public forum because the latter refused to save his son or even visit Gon   Leorio even abandons the aspiration of leading the Hunter Association and the election only after Gon gets better  As President  Leorio s first order would have been to ask all Hunters to come together and save Gon while citing how much he sacrificed himself to save humanity from the ants  Senritsu said Leorio had the kindest heartbeat in the city   Leorio also knows how to use Fe to his advantage  He is able to successfully haggle prices down when in Yorkshin  Leorio used his charisma  sincerity  and shared his personal weaknesses and vulnerabilities to the Hunters to advance far into the election  showing them that the President is not infallible and can make mistakes  but they can also grow from the Hunters that serve them  Leorio genuinely wanted to make the Association come together for a single purpose  He spoke about shared values and experiences during his speech   Leorio is also somewhat traditional  Leorio believes that older people or senpais deserve more respect among the group  and since he is older than Kurapika and Gon  he wants them to use honorifics for him  Leorio cornered Ging during the press conference  as it is a duty as a father to be there and protect his son  Leorio values the tradition of family relationships  as he went overboard when two people challenged and shook up his beliefs on how families should operate  To Leorio  parents should never let their kids die  parents should never sacrifice their own  Leorio comes to view his friends as his surrogate family and goes to extreme lengths to protect all of them  Leorio developed a hatsu based on his studies of medicine and biology  one that lets him perform surgeries without expensive surgical equipment  one that lets him treat an illness without cutting someone up and to remove the disease from the body  Leorio s past guided his present  as he became a doctor because he couldn t save his friend s life  This is why he wants to save his current friends   This is why Leorio snapped at the elderly proctor and Ging  they are casually throwing away loved ones that they can save  and Leorio lost his best friend that he couldn t save  Being a doctor also requires substantial amounts of studying and reciting information  a heavily Si career  Leorio is taking an established life path that others have followed and succeeded at doing  being a doctor and taking the Hunter Exam for the funding he needs  It may seem like Leorio has Se  being impulsive  reckless  materialistic  quick to anger  liking to travel  and indulging in sex and drink  But when you get down to it  that is just his sx manifesting itself  Leorio is almost always dictated by the past  He can be cautious such as when he allowed Morel to negotiate with Killua s butlers  or when he appeased Chrollo so that he can save Gon and Killua  Leorio is cool headed when it counts  He is only impulsive when he is willing to throw his own life away ,esfj

Hachi being an sx    If anything she s the defintion of sp   ,esfj
I just started the show and I was convinced she would be typed as an ESFP  considering the first few episodes  Her Se was very prominent but judging from the other comments her character probably develops later on in the show  so I ll wait a bit before I vote,esfj

I think Brandon is an ESTJ  myself ,esfj
Here are a few quotes of his that I gathered of his that may be useful in typing him       For too long in this society  we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community    Dominant Fe  focus on collective values      My position is that I am personally opposed to abortion  but I don t think I have a right to impose my view on the rest of society  I ve thought a lot about it  and my position probably doesn t please anyone  I think the government should stay out completely  I will not vote to overturn the Court s decision  I will not vote to curtail a woman s right to choose abortion  But I will also not vote to use federal funds to fund abortion    Dominant Fe and inferior Ti  he shows a preference of going along with the opinions of the public  putting aside his own personal opinion      We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society  for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference    Ni      Failure at some point in your life is inevitable  but giving up is unforgivable    Ni Se      The greatest gift is the ability to forget   to forget the bad things and focus on the good    Definitely not Si  as high Si users are known to file away past events and other sensory information as a way to prepare for what could go wrong   Hope this short overview on a few key quotes of his helps briefly explain why I believe he s an ENFJ ,esfj
Trying to type him has been my most frustrating go at it thus far ,esfj
joooeooeoeoeoeoeoeoe bidennnn    attack   ,esfj
Definitely ESFJ  He clearly inherited their annoying tactile modus operandi   I wish ESFJ s like him and the ones I ve encountered in real life would keep their hands to themselves and stop patting touching on people s shoulders back etc anytime they re telling someone something ,esfj

one of the main reasons why people are thinking she may use Fi is because she is thinking about her life purpose   but would a Fi user think about stuff like that around this time in her life   by this time i mean age     wouldn t that be a main concern prior her current age  these votes only increased after   R   was released and the title track  arguably the one most authentic to her is  on the ground  which is typed as ESFJ  Fe users are allowed to care about themselves and wonder about their life purpose  you all know that right   i honestly have no clue about her typing  just thought i should comment this because although the Fi evidence is good some evidence just doesn t make much sense lmao,esfj

why so sp instead of sp so  from what i know about ros  sp   description fits her way more than so    The anxiety of the Six blends with the self preservation instinct to make fear and insecurity a theme for this cautious subtype  To feel safe  they build strong alliances and relationships with others  They are sincerely affectionate and warm hearted in their interactions with others  They repress anger and are hesitant to share opinions  preferring to be cautious than risk mistakes  ,esfj
I don t know that much about her but from what I ve seen  I think she s an ESFJ  I don t think she has Fi in her primary function stack  Even in this video   https   www youtube com watch v  B eTJCoBck list TLPQMDkxMDIwMjEOZwOktFSq w index    which is pretty much all about her  what she s wearing doing etc  her Fe really shines through  She tries to include and engage with everyone  make them feel valued and appreciated  She s incredibly sweet  polite and socially conscious  I think her Ne is pretty visible too  but she s definitely not a Ne Fi user imo  Si inferior is not an option and Fi instead of Fe   definitely not  Not to mention that in terms of her temperament  E IXXJ fits perfectly  I don t see any XXXP type as a possibility   P  S  I have a YT channel about the MBTI types of celebrities and movie characters  I make analysis style videos with plenty of examples of people characters using their cognitive functions  If you would like to check it out  here is the link to my recent video  Kim Kardashian analysis   I ve created a Kardashians series        ,esfj

This page s a mess  lol  Before you come to cuss me out or ignore me for voting for non cogitaded hypotheses  give me some chance to introduce arguments          First of all  treating MBTI  Reminder that I ll mostly use Jung s model for it   Rather than get directly to the point  I think it s important to differentiate between Fi and Fe and then Si and Se since until now I have not seen any plausible argument for either ESFJ or ESFP                                                     Fi Fe     Fi  slightly adapted and and highly shortened            In the presence of something that might carry one away or arouse enthusiasm  this type observes a benevolent neutrality  tempered with an occasional trace of superiority and criticism that soon takes the wind out of the sails of a sensitive object        The relation to the object is  kept in acure and tranquil middle state of feeling  Expression of feeling  therefore  remains niggardly and  when once aware of it at all  the object has a permanent sense of his undervaluation  It s not always the case  since very often the deficit remains unconscious       Misunderstanding is a characteristic occurrence in the life of this type  and is commonly registered as a most weighty argument against any deeper feeling relation with the object  But the underlying  real object of this feeling is only dimly divined by the normal type        So long as the ego feels itself housed  as it were  beneath the heights of the unconscious subject  and feeling reveals something higher and mightier than the ego  the type is normal  The unconscious thinking is certainly archaic  yet its reductions may prove extremely helpful in compensating the occasional inclinations to exalt the ego into the subject  But  whenever this does take place by dint of complete suppression of the unconscious reductive thinking products  the unconscious thinking goes over into opposition and becomes projected into objects  Whereupon the now egocentric subject comes to feel the power and importance of the depreciated object               Fe  slightly adapted and and highly  VERY highly shortened           An assimilation of subject to object then occurs as almost completely to engulf the subject of feeling        The basis of the ego always remains identical with itself  and  therefore  appears definitely opposed to the changing states of feeling  Accordingly the observer senses the display of feeling not so much as a personal expression of the feeling subject as an alteration of his ego  a mood  in other words  Corresponding with the degree of dissociation between the ego and the momentary state of feeling  signs of disunion with the self will become more or less evident  i e  the original compensatory attitude of the unconscious becomes a manifest opposition  This reveals  in the first instance  in extravagant demonstrations of feeling       Summary of the differentiation of Fi and Fe     While Fi values things in a subjective way based on one s own moral and believing system and line of thought  Fe values things in an objective way to a point that morality itself can lose its own  essence       Why I consider Sayaka ExFP ExFJ in terms of Fi and Fe     Taking her wish for Kyubey as a basis  Sayaka was selective  too selective even  She chose to spend her wish on Kamijo instead of herself not out of  empathy  but because she valued Kamijo more than herself  Fi  when insalubrious and overdone  clings so tightly to the valued that she feels a possession over such  and that is exactly what happened  she felt threatened not because she saw that she had spent her desire for nothing  but because she felt that something of her own had been stolen when she saw Hitomi and Kamijo together                                                  Continue in replies  ,esfj
i haven t seen any good ESFP argument  her Fe is really huge by starting with the fact that she spent her wish not on herself but for other person goodness  she l became a magical girl to save others literally not letting people to be hurt and caring anout them is one of her main calling,esfj
Pasting from a reply to another comment  here is why I think Sayaka is a    despite her wish for another person  and seeming disintegration into    Firstly  disintegration isn t the best way to type someone  Second an argument for disintegration to   could definitely be made  When she was put under stress she acted like an unhealthy   in general  Very critical towards others  putting pressure on herself  feeling shame at her failure to live up to the heroic ideal of a magical girl    disintegration   Even if she did act  ish she still needs a basis of   traits  which she doesn t really have   s are very good at using peoples feelings to create the image of a loveable person  and they can be manipulative  especially when unhealthy  Although her wish comes off as a result of her being a    I don t think a   would just let the person they re in love with and did so much for date another person  Especially since the reason she didn t confess to him was that she felt inadequate because her soul wasn t in her body    to   disintegration   In her conversation with Kyoko  Sayaka refuses to adopt her philosophy on life because integrity is so important to her  she knows what she s doing is self destructive but does it anyway  Her breaking point comes when she realizes that the world is terrible and her heroism isn t worth it  this is because she abandons all of the   s strengths of being hard working virtuous and admirable and dives completely into the moody anxious overly critical weaknesses ,esfj
She definitely comes across as an ESFP  but you have to remember that enneagram is a better test for categorizing one s characteristics  while MBTI focuses on their inner workings  Sayaka definitely gives the vibes of the  happy go lucky  energetic girl  but this doesn t correlate with being an Se dom   Also she is the DEFINITION of sp blind  the only thing I m shaky about is whether she s sx so or so sx   Talking about her enneagram as well  the only thing about her that comes off as   is her making a wish to help someone and not violently murder lifeforms   I feel like any person with Fe or common sense would do the same when in her position  that doesn t make them a    We also have to think about how she acted before being put in her supernatural situation  she seemed to me like a healthy   who disintegrated into an unhealthy   ,esfj
read some ESFJs explanation and i m quite convinced about it but i m not about her enneagram because i think  w  suits her more than the  w ,esfj
SPOILERS ON WHAT SHE USES HER WISH FOR         i genuinely can t see her as an ESFJ   she s such an ESFP   just because she thinks of other people and her wish was for another person  it doesn t necessarily mean she s a Fe user  It literally says on her wiki page that she rarely thinks before she does something  it s such a clear use of Se  She s impulsive most times and is always adjusting to her environment  Being a Se Fi user doesn t mean you don t have any regrets  Her using her wish to heal the boy she loves can be taken as Fi if you think about it  She only healed him because she felt responsible to do so  she felt like it was on her  She s such a clear ESFP  people should stop typing characters from their vibes   if you have any arguments about this please reply to me cause i d really like to understand ESFJ   if she was a Fe dom  i can see her more as an ENFJ,esfj
I just watched the anime again and she s such a clear cased ESFP it hurts  I was really surprised while looking at her page here  She s the Madoka Magica s world s Gon   I really don t understand the ESFJ consensus and arguments   She s the typical ESFP girl by stereotype  and even when you look at the way she thinks she s a clear Fi type  Yes she got inspired by Mami  but she did not just  followed  what Mami did  Even after Mami told her not to make a wish for someone else  she still did after thinking about it quite seriously  She took her decision based on her feelings alone   I would say  her entire arc is her getting destroyed by her own Fi similarly to Gon  because she never let go  She was way too virtuous  When she finally sympathizes with Kyouko too  she can sympathizes with her only when she hears her story compared to Mami who directly tries to be sympathic with Homura for example  but she still don t compromise her own moral by refusing eating a stolen apple   Her Fi is actually so strong I could even type her as a ISFP if she wasn t such a classic genki girl ,esfj
idk i feel like she s more motivated by her morals especially when she becomes a magical girl  her trying to carry out mamis legacy is her trying to carry on those morals that are of helping people  her helping people reinforces her morals  not the other way around imo ,esfj
ok i ve been converted i guess she really is an ESFJ  it s funny  because if i knew that someone is discussing whether a character is an ESFJ or an ESFP i d think the debaters would be typing them wrong  by letters  rather than by functions  but both sides actually had great points     i can see how her Fe Si makes her so driven to embody her role as a magical girl  her fight with Kyoko would also show how Fe despises selfish people   rebellious people that disturb other s peaceful environment  and her w  explains her stubbornness ,esfj
this website always fails to take into account how instinctual variants and enneagram overlaps  historia is not an so      In contrast to the other Two subtypes  the Social Two appears as a powerful or intellectual person  This Two has a passion for power  and their pride is expressed through having influence and advantages and cultivating an image of being an influential person    this does not sound like historia at all  the sp   explanation literally fits her so well so instead of just copying it here just go read this https   www personalitycafe com threads self preservation twos according to beatrice chestnut        ,esfj
 w  argument  she displays absolutely no    she isn t how she is for any altruistic reason  it s because she feels it s the only way to get by and be appreciated  when her facade cracks when she s battling her father  and she s screaming at eren saying she s the worst girl to have ever lived  it really shows this wasn t for the sake of altruism it was because she was taught from a young age that the only right way to be was to be kind and girlish and loving and helpful  for the approval of others  not to hold herself to some upstanding internal values ,esfj
She is not Agressive romance style and will never be  She is not Te valuing and will never be  She is emotional and changes the mood of people and also make sure to make comfort in herself and others  Doesn t value pragmatism or effectiveness or       ESE  just a least outgoing one  ESE is also caring  Do not confuse      ,esfj
im so happy that she finally voted as an ESFJ  but why so sx    Her attitude gives me sp vibe ,esfj
how is she  w  and not  w    i thought that was kinda obvious  and besides i don t see her having many   traits at all,esfj
Why everyone here is saying that Historia is an ESFJ because  unlinke Armin  she s  kind  weak  naive and cute   She literally said in the  rd season that her whole personality was a lie       Historia definitely doesn t need other people to have energy  Extrovert Exxx  and she really thinks outside of her senses    Sensing xSxx  Y all just stayed in the first seasons    ,esfj
shes literally armin  with a dash of  nice  manic pixie dream girl   While she is smart shes not as smart as the crystal stroker ,esfj
Can someone please explain why sp   im curious   ,esfj
why so sx  I see her more sp,esfj
I remember how Undyne told about Papyrus  history of his status    I don t know if he is   or   now  He values status game over being loved by others slightly  but how he stayed in the hall of her house all night just to prove his devotion kinda signals  w  and Ne usage at scale ,esfj
This guy is the one of the view ESFJs I will ever like  He is without doubt an ESFJ icon  and in my eyes the biggest    He is so much of a    It hurts  He does not care more about admiration than he cares about being likes  loved and so on  The w  is simply his tool to get the things he wants  but that does not meant that he only cares about it   w s want to be admired  and they want to gain a followership of people admiring them  But a  w  is someone who wants to be loved and liked by everyone  the w  will manifest in the behavior that they wanna  win  everyone over to like them  That is the point of his character  He is so caring  and compassionate  He can be annoying af  but I couldn t help but like his attempts to help you and such ,esfj
Just cuz he s eccentric that doesn t mean he s an ENFP  By stereotypes Papyrus is an ENFP  but by cognitive functions he s an ESFJ  First of all  this guy is a walking Fe dom  He sees the good in the world and wants to be admired by others  the reason he wanted to join the royal guard was so he could be popular and have friends  if that doesn t scream Fe then I don t know what does   Of course  ENFP voters are gonna say  but he went against his orders and spared Frisk  that s obviously personal values   and I can see where they re coming from but that can really work for both Fe and Fi  and aside from that he isn t concerned about his values or identity  instead he s concerned about his social status and popularity  Another argument I ve seen for ENFP is that  his jokes and puzzles are Ne   but consider this  ESFJs have tert Ne  he can still come up with abstract concepts and such  again  stop with this stereotype that sensors can t be creative  And also  while I can understand that his puzzles are Ne  if Papyrus really has high Ne then he would come up with new puzzles on the spot  but we never see him do that  And he uses Si more than Ne  his Si is how he wants to live up to his responsibilities  which to him is becoming a member of the royal guard  Ne is only seen in his jokes and puzzles  while Si is seen because of his commitment to proving himself to others  and that doubles as Fe Si too  ,esfj
Unpopular opinion  but I actually think Papyrus is an ESFP rather than ENFP or ESFJ   I don t believe he s a Fe dom  He enjoys being unique and eccentric  he doesn t show any care about fitting in necessarily or seek social harmony in any form  He wants to be popular  but rather than changing his ways to be a popular person he simply thinks that if he work hard and be good people will admire and like him despite him being away from the standard  In moments of insecurity he momentarily changes his opinion to conform with the majority  but he doesn t seem to be comfortable doing so at all  Also  obviously judges the world as what is good vs what is bad and has really strong individual beliefs  which are very characteristic of Fi users   A Ne dom doesn t make much sense either  He lacks any consideration for possibilities and shows dislike to inconsistency  We can see it by comparing him to Sans  a very obvious Ne dom  He seems annoyed by Sans  unbothered stance and lack of activity  Rather  being Se dom can explain why he s always in the moment  ready to take action  He s straightforward and energetic  as well as being brave and confident  He also believes everyone s shares the same opinions as him  and if they do not they should  It s important to notice how he uses inferior Ni as well  he s ambitious  determined and hardworking  but often lacks proper planning and consideration for implications and hidden meanings ,esfj
Why is everyone here so sure that all the kind and cute characters are Fe dom   Have you read about Fi  Fi dom aux users are empathic and concerned about other people s emotions There are unhealthy Fi users  as well as Fe users concerned only with their status  Papyrus is clearly not very concerned about what others think about him  all his kindness comes down to a very well developed Fi Yes  he doesn t even care about harmony as such  so stop making all the good ESFJ characters   ,esfj
He doesn t necessarily have Fi in his stack simply because he s rebelling against his orders to kill Frisk  Fe users are concerned with external harmony  occasionally overlooking what feels right to them personally  We can see this clearly early game when Papyrus knows his orders and genuinely wants to fulfill them  but Frisk s emotional relevance alters his mindset  He has a great understanding of what is deemed morally correct by society and abides by those rules for the most part excusing the occasion where it disrupts external harmony  Si is another misunderstood function   it s not when traditional and repetitive   it s a fairly complex function reliant on sensory information and experience  Papyrus is frequently using Si for example  when he refers back to previous puzzles  changing elements based on what he has processed about the player  This in combination with his dominant function is so obvious  storing information  using it for the betterment of his relationships   Ne tertiary because whilst he uses it a lot  he s much more reliant on his dom   aux functions  I d say his Ne is more like a supporting side aspect  We witness Papyrus be blind to possibilities  patterns and theoretical outcomes multiple times throughout the game   using the early game puzzles as an example again  in setting up the floor MTT puzzle  he blindly rushes into it without thinking about the multiple possibilities which could come out of it   but his Ne is still developed and can be used effectively when he needs it  Ti inferior is fairly self explanatory  disregarding evaluation  logic and facts because he d rather impulsively run around pursuing his goals   contributing to society in a more physical Fe based manner ,esfj
Obvious Fe dom cuz he loooooves people and he s also perfectly willing to spare you on a genocide run cuz he still sees the good in you  His Si can probably be misinterpreted as Ne or Ni cuz of all the setups he comes up with  but he prefers using the same setups instead of coming up with new ones  He s very obviously an ESFJ and idk why people are typing him as an ENFP  where s the Fi exactly ,esfj
Toby is a genius  to create a character who looks like an ultra tough brutal villain  obsessed with a plan to capture a human  but in fact a kind person ESFJ who will not offend a fly ,esfj
SLOAN for sure  He gets upset easily when things don t go his way and is very anxious about getting things right  Limbic over Calm,esfj
So  I ll admit  the arguments for both ESFJ and ENFP on this page are really cluttered  and it s a bit difficult to understand the overall points people are going for  So  if I have misinterpreted anything in this comment  do let me know  the last thing I want to do is strawman people making good arguments  However  from what I can see  I suspect many of the ENFP votes come from a misunderstanding of the cognitive functions   Many people have voted for Fi   Fe with an argument along the lines of  he s rebellious to the expectations of his culture   What this is referring to is his persistence towards being friends with Frisk  the human who the monster society thinks he should hate  This is a fair argument at first  but really simplified  Both Fe and Fi users can be rebellious against the way things are  but in different ways  given that Fe use is externally focused  what Fe users want is harmony between the emotions of those in their environment  and given that Fi use is internally focused  what Fi users want is harmony between their attitudes and their behaviour  While Papyrus doesn t hold himself to the expectations of his culture  he never demonstrates this level of cognitive dissonance expected from an Fi user  he s not going against the grain because he has some personal emotional attitude that leads him to believe Frisk should be treated as a friend  but because he struggles to see anyone in a state of harm  This is exactly why  despite going against societies expectations  he severely struggles to actually actively speak up against anyone about it  as demonstrated when he tries to explain his actions to Undyne   and he instead approaches this deviation from the norm by trying to show everyone else his perspective  Consider the date with Undyne that Frisk goes on  where Papyrus  insistence on seeing them get along leads to him very obviously setting up a contrived situation to force them to get closer   To summarise the point here  Papyrus does show deviation from the expectations of his culture  but this isn t inherently Fi   Fe  He does not go against these expectations due to any sense of cognitive dissonance  as you d expect from an Fi user  and instead goes against these expectations for the sake of ensuring no one is left out or hurt  as you d expect from an Fe user  While it feels silly to point out  just think of historical Fe centric rebels like Martin Luther King Jr  an ENFJ  and think of how they approach the feeling of  something around me is wrong  here s the decision I ll take to make it better   That s a very universal thing  not just an Fi thing  and Papyrus goes about it in an Fe manner   I might as well add on a bit here about the Si Ne axis  From what I can see  both the ESFJ and ENFP voters pretty much universally agree that he has fairly good Ne  so I ll glaze over that  Si is a bit more complicated though  since it s by far one of the most misunderstood functions  To simplify  Si is an information processing function focused on creating detailed  physical mental imagery of experiences  that can be referred back to whenever a new situation is introduced and needs to be interpreted  The fact that an Si user will likely constantly be referring back to  how things were  when understanding a situation is why it s often thought of as a  traditionalist  function  though this is in part a stereotype  It is true that Papyrus isn t very traditionalist  as people have mentioned  but consider one of his recurring character traits  his obsession with simple  repetitive stimulations  Whenever Papyrus is introduced to a new situation  such as on his date with Frisk or on the Undyne date  his first reaction is to refer back to the things he already knows  While a rudimentary and kind of silly example  an obvious one is his love of spaghetti  he s tried spaghetti a few times  really enjoyed it  and now sees it as a primary way of solving issues  like how he gives Frisk spaghetti on their date  simply because he knows he enjoys it and so can only rely on the idea that Frisk might like it too    I d love to go further into detail  but this comment is quickly approaching the character limit  so I ll add one more thing  that aforementioned situation is an example of Si serving Fe  due to his Si being used for Fe goals  which is exactly what an ESFJ does  His Ne balances out his Si by giving him a better ability to consider new perspectives and take in more than surface level information  and his inferior Ti shows in his constant inability to derive reasonable logical conclusions  as shown  for example  in his delusional conclusions about Frisk in the Genocide route   With Fe being served by Si  Si being balanced out by Ne  and a characteristic lack of Ti  there s a good argument for dominant Fe  auxillary Si  tertiary Ne  and inferior Ti  ESFJ all the way ,esfj
she s everything i want to be in life,esfj
As a guy who admits having    songs of her in his daily playlist  I can t seem to sense or hear any Ni in her songs  what is this Ni you guys are talking about  Oh you mean introverted intuition  you people that voted ENFJ have to be kidding right    Fe  Expressive of her emotions and seems to have a huge priority on being comfortable and friendly to people  Seems to feel like she has a certain task to do for her fans and friends  lyrics   Likes to be part of a group I guess   Si  because her lyrics are about mainly reflections of the past  moving on from them  comparisons with the present ,esfj
Okay now i just don t think ESE is reasonable any more and probably comes from  She writes empty bubbly happy pop songs yay ESE   EII aRe nOt tHaT mAtEriAliStiC   sUpErFicIaL   the way to determine someone s socionics type is to look at their behavior  not exactly anything they  say   here s how fetty wap described taylor s work ethics   she broke down how she structured her life  She would take off all year to write her music  get in her zone  meditate and go through her books      Fetty Wap added that Swift has a system of checks and balances to ensure everyone is doing their job properly   She would hire a manager to look at this manager  hire a lawyer to watch this lawyer   he told Akademiks  The    time Grammy Award winner would take time out to write and then dedicate additional time for everything else that goes along with a new album     I was like   Oh this makes a lot of sense  because I m tired as f        An alpha won t even bother having that much organisation in their life  before someone rages at me I m not saying that alphas can t be workaholic or       they re just not as workaholic as deltas  no matter what   ESEs will always value comfort over work  and that s just so not like Taylor,esfj
I think the Fe is very obvious since she is always focused on making sure that everyone around her feels good and is accounted for  and she often pushes her own personal wants and values behind others  Also  she is very impressionistic about her own memories and recall  showing strong Si with how she doesn t seek to experience the world to its fullest  but rather seeks to recognize what is familiar and absorb experiences in a personal form  making her very connected to her interpretation of the world  Also she is constantly seeking change and new understanding  which is common for Ne users  but the changes she seeks are more conceptual and differing for her from a basis of her own perspective rather than it being physical Se change ,esfj
I think she uses Se Si but if someone prove me I m wrong I can retype,esfj

why are y all voting ESFJ  don t you see that she can make plans  obviously she s a Ni user   please stop  ni   make plans,esfj
I commented this awhile ago but since she s trending I thought I could talk about it again  She s definitely not EVFL  On her Netflix documentary  Miss Americana   she made it very clear that her main goal is to achieve success   to be good at what she does  Her insane ambition is a clear manifestation of  V  And her  people focused  and  people pleasing  personality makes her  E Very obvious  She s too connected and concerned about others  feelings and opinions to not be VExx   E types are others negative  they aren t that worried about others  emotions and feelings  they prioritize theirs  And  V types have passive volition  they are relaxed about goals and accomplishments  Taylor definitely isn t  Emotional    E  ExFJs are always voted as EVFL for some reason  even when they are usually very clear  E types   And the  V votes    How can someone so determined and ambitious have  V  Not to mention that ELFV    w  doesn t seem like a possible combination ,esfj
Just because she has Ni in her music does not mean she has Ni in her stack  in my experience  i often get mistaken for an Ni user because the combination of Fe Ne can appear as a high Ni user  Her enneagram is obviously also going to make her goal future oriented  however  i have very slim knowledge on taylor as a person  and this opinion is strictly limited to what i m seeing in the comments  anyway  happy birthday to this legend ,esfj
Intuitive types  Face life expectantly  craving inspiration  Admit fully to consciousness only the sense impressions related to the current inspiration  they are imaginative at the expense of observation  Are by nature initiators  inventors and promoters  having no taste for life as it is  and small capacity for living life as it is and enjoying the present  They are restless   You do you  but all of that sounds pretty SpongeBob,esfj

SpongeBob is absolutely ESE  He s always full of emotion  joy  happiness  and positivity  very consistent traits of an ESE  He has the child like  expressive  imaginative  fun loving traits of an extroverted Alpha quadra type    Very passionate about his job and hobbies  Fe Ne valuing   He s not concerned about the money he makes there  Te role   he just passionately enjoys his job as it is  Fe Si   He enjoys all kinds of activities  such as jellyfishing  karate  going to the Goo Lagoon  cleaning his house  and taking care of his personal hygiene  Si creative   He s also conscientous  which fits rational type  While he shows a strong dislike to violence  he doesn t mind applying pressure volition to others when needed and is very adapt to it  Se demonstrative     Him not having awareness of time being freeflowing and infinite  and instead sees it as exact and precise due to not wanting to be late at work  is clearly an indicator of Ni vulnerable  SpongeBob also treats everyone as equal  no matter how good or evil they are  he even tries to make the likes of Squidward and Plankton happy  who aren t much like him  Fi ignoring     SpongeBob being best friends with Patrick  SEI  is also a very good example of them belonging to the Alpha quadra as well as them being mirror types  with SpongeBob being EJ and Patrick being IP    He s likely an ESE Fe subtype  with boosted ethics and intuition  but him being Fe valuing is very obvious ,esfj

I m wondering about why she s a Social   first  Is it because people tend to separate the variants from enneagram  She s much more sp so     In the quest to perfect themselves  Self Preservation Ones believe it s bad to be angry and so make a virtue of being tolerant  forgiving  and sweet whenever possible  Underneath  these Ones are very angry  but they control it  Under pressure  however  this One s anger may leak out as irritation  resentment  frustration  or self righteousness     Beatrice Chestnut s definition of a Sp   ,esfj

I can see why people are thinking ESFJ for her because of her  caretaker  type role  but I actually think she s an ENFJ  I don t see much Si in her  Katara doesn t make decisions based on how things have always been  she s an advocate for change  and she doesn t struggle with it at all  She does have some respect for the law in The Runaway  but that s because her Ni foresight is telling her that this is risky  not because she thinks the existing systems are always to be trusted  Katara uses Ni  She has a vision for what she wants the world to look like in the future  and everything she does is to help the world get to the place where she envisions it  Helping the Avatar  fighting sexism  helping civilians  those are all her Ni trying to build a better world  I see some people thinking she s a sensor because she s not very metaphorical  but it s really all about the cognitive functions   She also uses her Ni intuition when she trusts Zuko in Crossroads of Destiny  even though Si would look to the past and say no  don t trust him  The only reason she s cautious about this later is because she s trying to avoid making the same mistake  Understandable even if she s an Ni user  I also see Se over Ne as her tertiary function  Katara doesn t envision different ideas for how things could end up  she sees the ONE RIGHT path forward  The Avatar will come back  will master all four elements  etc  That s her vision of the future   She also loops Fe and Se  not Fe and Ne  She doesn t get stuck wondering about all of the different possible decisions she could make and worrying what will please others the most  she has the desire to help others and she has to act on it RIGHT NOW THIS INSTANT  In doing this  she loses her Ni foresight  Fe Se loop   I know a lot of people also thing she s an ESFJ because she s organized and takes care of everyone  but ENFJs can do all of those things  too  Katara looks to the future and her gut instincts for answers  not to the past and the existing systems  Thus  ENFJ  But that s just my opinion   As for her Enneagram  it s hard to distinguish between   and    Katara clearly loves helping others  that s what she does  She s very moralistic AND very centered around community and giving to others  She s a cartoon character  and we don t see inside her head  so it s hard to really know what her core motivation is  HOWEVER  I am saying   because I think she very clearly disintegrates to   and integrates to    not disintegrates to   and integrates to   ,esfj
I just love her for how she s the strongest and most realistic main ESFJ girl that can be feminine and motherly but can be strong and that just makes her better ToT,esfj

Actually I don t really pay much attention to ISVs  mainly because they tend to accentuate the negative traits or personality of core   so the healthy   would probably better fit the description of the other enneagram subtypes regardless of how likely they re a    I can see the case where she can be a so   or   but at the same time I always see her as a poster child of a   in a healthy form  Two at its best are extremely caring and unconsciously generous  They are highly empathetic and caring individuals who put others  needs above their own  They have intuitive abilities to anticipate the emotional gaps of others and support them  The main thing that made me think that she might indeed be a   is how the dominant feeling of the heart based enneatype is shame  Like Mineta who often show his fear cause he s a head type  Uraraka is often embarrassed when it comes to her love for Midoriya  Sure  she cares about the harmony and peace of the group but I could say that this is not her top priority  someone who has a triple positive will look passive and harmonious regardless of what their core is  I just think that her main focus is to express her love feelings to Deku  She also intends to help her parents who are categorized as economically disadvantaged  I see this more as a motivation of a       Healthy Type Twos are able to serve others while also meeting their own needs  They also know how to love and accept themselves as they are  and rely less on approval from other people   I think Uraraka s biggest problem is that she relies too much on Deku  She makes Deku an inspirational extra to solve all her problems  she s obsessively trying to emulate everything of what he does  This could have something to do with how pragmatic triads like to bring their behavior from their local environment  but personally I see this more as the conflic of   cores  The moral value she should apply more is  to rely less on approval from others  and I think this is her personality and depth overall  But I don t know if this has more to do with her as Ti inf than her as a   core  According to the Hornevian Triad theory    is in the Compliant Triad  They re committed  hard workers  sacrificial  and responsible  Uraraka really prioritizes to carry out her task of approaching herself towards others in order to fulfill her desire  This would explain why she intends to help her parents in enriching her family s economic life  this is also possible for her needs too it s just that she never realized and considered it  If she s a   then she would be at the withdrawn triad  Triple Withdrawn are withdrawn in their own ways but they all move away from people in hopes of earning what they desire  Since the essence of core withdrawn is to detach oneself from the surrounding environment  I can t see Uraraka as part of this Triad  Maybe social   is the friendliest   so I don t know if this applies  I might focus more on enneacore   on its own because I find subtypes unreliable at times  but I believe she will be sp   if she s indeed a    Though I consider her as social   if my assumption is wrong because I think she fits both of relationist and attachment triad  Also I m not really sure if she s an ego driven kind of person,esfj
She is definitely an ESFJ  For those of you that voted she is an ENFP  please consider the following     Her Fe is really strong  She s a big empathizer and so far we haven t seen her get into any conflict at all  unless I m forgetting something    Her Ne is tertiary  not dominant  She isn t the type to brainstorm or have big ideas    She has strong Si  She s understands through experience  For instance  she didn t want to become a hero to save people until she saw Nighteye die before her eyes   But  then again  I could be wrong  After all  I could see her having strong Fi ,esfj
Wait  There are no comments on why she is Unorganized over Organized  Literally why  Being relaxed and easygoing  laid back  doesn t necessary means low Orderliness  It also doesn t restrain you to make some impulsive decisions  this may just be her tert Ne ,esfj
I am starting to lean towards social   over social    but I m not going to vote yet because a lot of   subtypes describe an unhealthy    and Ochako is an obviously healthy character     A paradox exists for the social Seven who needs friends and group projects to express both social idealism and love of life  Harnessing oneself to the greater good of the group or community creates a sense of sacrifice  as participation with others requires limitations to personal expansiveness and planning for future outcomes     This is the best social   description I found    This Two uses their seductive powers in a more intellectual way to attract and engage groups  communities and broader systems  They stand out from the crowd  often taking a central or leadership role  They enjoy being  in the know  and build their influence on their competence and connections  Giving more than they get may be a strategy to distract them from uncomfortable feelings  Less childlike than other Twos  their ambition and influence can mistype as a type Three or Eight     If she is core    I think she is a sexual two rather than a social two  sx so specifically     This Two focuses their talents  seductive abilities and energy on attracting and building strong  intimate relationships  In close relationships they are then able to feel trust and assert their needs more clearly  They are strong willed  flexible and passionate   even wild at heart   which may cause mistyping with Enneagram    Highly devoted in close relationships  they may find it difficult to accept limits or take  no  for an answer     I think social   fits her best out of the three descriptions  If core   she is definitely          ,esfj
Honestly  why   for her head fix though  She fits more   characteristics but that can just be me ,esfj
Can someone list any examples of her showing   traits  Is it because she wants to help her parents out of poverty  also I m pretty torn between core   vs   ,esfj
In the grand scheme of things  Uraraka is not in tune with her own emotions like Fi users are  It takes her   seasons to even realize she has feelings for Deku  Likewise  she is incredibly attuned to the feelings of others  Even watching heroes from a young age  she is naturally focused on other peoples  emotions  Fe  rather than the heroics  in this situation  a Ne dom would likely be more curious about the situation rather than focused entirely on the people around them   She is significantly more attuned to others  emotions than her own  which is much more indicative of Fe than Fi  And she is significantly more attuned to others  emotions than possibilities  which is more indicative of stronger Fe than Ne   I would agree that Uraraka uses Ne more than several other SJs in the series  but that does not necessarily make her a Ne dom  Ne doms don t just see possibilities  they are DRIVEN by possibilities  Likewise  Fe doms are driven by people  If you look at Uraraka s goals and desires  they all revolve around supporting the people around her  In every decision Uraraka makes  it s all for the underlying purpose of supporting people  Yes  she does Gunhead s training and tries something new  but imo it s not necessarily for a Ne motivation of wanting to learn  it s more for a Fe motivation of wanting to be able to save people in a variety of situations  I m not saying only Fe users can help people  I m instead saying that Ne doms do not generally have their world revolving entirely around people   Here s something someone pointed out to me when I was arguing for ENFP    She gets better at fighting with experience with the knowledge she has of her opponents or remembers something she was taught  which is a pretty solid demonstration of Si  Her battle with    had her thinking back to what Gunhead told her about fighting in her own field rather than her opponent s    There are many more examples of Fe and Si in Uraraka  She was extremely uncomfortable with pursuing her own purpose until her parents told her to  The way she constantly thinks  What would Deku do   correlates to Fe Si       i mentioned in a previous thread that i was arguing with someone on Reddit about Uraraka s type by using former arguments against me from when i was an ENFP voter  this is that argument lol ,esfj
why is she a social    I ve read the description of the subtypes and I feel that none of the descriptions fit her  can someone explain it to me ,esfj
Still confused about the lack of SCOAI vote for her  I ll bring you a psychoanalysis for her characteristics related to organization    Uraraka is devoted to her studies  dutifulness  and loyal to her family and friends  She has a steel grit and incredible determination  self discipline or willpower   She is willing to do anything to achieve her goal  achievement seeking   This side of her personality  her great determination  and stubbornness are shown at the sports festival in her match with Katsuki  The Organized trait matches Ochaco more serious  determined traits  Ochaco is practical  she s aware of her limits  deliberation or cautiousness  and she takes an internship in combat training from Gunhead to increase her mobility    She has more than half of the organizational traits that make her more likely to be an O  She may be scattered but she has a great sense of responsibility  so why not SCOAI instead ,esfj
would she be more si aux or ni aux  ,esfj
All parents would love an ESFJ child,esfj
uhhh ok so my mother wants me to be fe te ne se  w    send help,esfj
  all temperaments except melancholic,esfj
All my parents wish I was ESTJ  w    ,esfj
Apparently  I am supposed to be practically the exact opposite of me  No wonder I have a   wing and fix  I m tired of this indoctrination of beliefs that are being shoved here  If these comments are true  then it really shows how complaining and unappreciative parents are   The way the parenting system works just makes children slaves to their parent s desires and is generally risky  to be honest  Making parenting specialized or raising children elsewhere would be more effective ,esfj
My parents never pushed me to be someone thing I m not,esfj
My mother loves me the way I am but that is probably because she is possibly ESFJ  She always tells me that I am charming  that all her friends love me  that I am funny and smart but she hates when I get angry  Now my father is another story  he is an INTJ and we get along on an intellectual level  we enjoy joking  watching sports and arguing  I like to annoy him with things without much value and he likes to make me angry  because he likes my reactions   But my father was always against the way I handle myself socially  how I argue with people  how I hang out with people who are not  good  people  how I always stand out in a bad way on the social world  Probably my father would have preferred to have a less socially conflictive son  someone who had a greater social conscience  someone more socially ordered or someone more manipulative and who knows how to hide his own personality so as not to generate unnecessary problems    Probably my father was talking about my lack of connection with my social senses  or how I always find a way with my thoughts to not follow the rules  I think his ideal type of son would be an ISTJ for being socially correct or an INTJ for being a little less socially conflictive,esfj
I guess they would love a son who is both practical and ambitious  who knows to do his duties and stay organized  and with great social skills,esfj
Dad wanted a son he could play catch with and who would go on to do great things and be a big dick alpha male  and what he got was an INFP weeb gamer who nobody wants to hire ,esfj
I m totally not what my mother wanr me to be  And I m grateful she didn t push me too hard to become who I m not ,esfj
Many people here have a misconception that dominant Fe is  altruism and dependence  and Si is  being super organized  and that is not how it works   Trying to explain Usagi s functions   Fe Dom   Fe  just like Fi  seeks to understand feelings and human depth  but Fe has an external basis  The search for interpersonal harmony and the depth of others  Despite being a function connected with the external  with the social  this doesn t mean that the Fe dom will be      altruistic and will do absolutely anything for the social without question  This is stupid and don t define dominant Fe   Usagi is a person who seeks interpersonal harmony  Everything that the character does has a external base  is An extremely Fe characteristic that she has is the fact that in many episodes Usagi is overly dependent on others to decide her self esteem and her current state  which is common in dominant Fe  Usagi repeatedly absorbed external opinions  like a sponge  She is someone who is easily offended by an opinion of the social   She is someone who values a lot of cooperation and external harmony  In addition  Usagi has repeatedly used interpersonal harmony to her advantage  Many think that this is a  Fi user thing      but the truth is that it is not  Fe is also about using interpersonal and social harmony to your advantage  whether for approval  favors  etc   An example of this is when Usagi considers using her friendship with Ami to get better grades in mathematics  From the outside  she would achieve something good  And the argument that  this is because she is  w    Doesn t work because she is clearly  w  AND Fe dom  If Usagi was only  w   but Fi user she would only have a great desire to be loved but still  she would have internal bases  she would seek at all costs to be  true to herself   Fi      something that the character doesnt do in the show   She has no search for authenticity  Which would be very strange for a supposed  high fi user  I saw some comments saying that  she does the things she believes to be right  so she is Fi user   This is a very limited argument  do the things you believe to be right doesn t make you a Fi user  being Fi high is much more than that  Fe doms are people with their own intelligence and feelings  people need to understand that having personal values does not make you fi user  because anyone can have personal values  Fe also deals with personal feelings  beliefs and values  but externally   It is useless to say that Usagi does the things she believes to be right  since    she is not self centered in values and has no search for authenticity    Si aux   Si doesn t envolve good memory and be organized  Is just a sensory use of impressions from the past to explain the present  something that Usagi does constantly  How can she be an inferior Si when she constantly uses her impressions of the past  It s not possible for an inferior Si to do this  Usagi despite being open to new possibilities because of her healthy Ne tertiary she loves and values stability A LOT   Si inferiors has detachment from stability and a single comfort zone  a problem that doesnt exist in Usagi   Most of the episodes are Usagi not wanting to leave her comfort zone  Usagi had a hard time accepting to be a hero just because of herauxiliary Si  she saw a very new situation and was lost  nervous  needing Luna s help  It is not possible for Usagi to be inferior Si  many associate the fact that she is  Airhead  with inferior Si  but understand that this has nothing to do  An  Airhead  Si user that uses his past impressions a lot and seeks patterns     is still a Si user   Usagi dont deny patterns of the past  doesnt ignore her sensory impressions of the past and it has a balanced use of the Si  something impossible for an inferior Si user  Please guys study about Si and don t cling to bad stereotypes of  organization  good memory and sameness   Tert Ne  Her Ne acts in two ways  being creative or being afraid of the future  Because of her healthy and fun Ne Tertiary people see her as ENFP  but the reality is  Usagi s Ne characteristics are all tertiary  and the Ne s problems that she presents are less than her sentimental ones  Fe  Healthy Tertiary Ne can also be creative and think outside the box  There are several ways to explain why she uses Ne  but is not dominant  but the main one is  If she were Ne dom  would be easier to her be impersonal  she would be so much more open to leaving comfort zones   Usagi is someone who is rarely able to be impersonal  she doesn t just think about possibilities but about feelings  in interpersonal harmony friends etc  The lack of impersonality of Usagi automatically discards an intuitive and non sentimental function as dominant  The truth is  the issues involving sentimentality are always stronger than Ne   Let s face it  Usagi is not a practical person who makes impersonal decisions  which largely rules out the possibility of Tert Te  ,esfj
personally  i see both types argued  i think it depends on perspective and perhaps even story arc  ESFJ and ENFP stacks are quite similar and i find myself stuck in between the two  ESFJ voters i completely agree with your reasoning  but i will play devils advocate to be diplomatic  please dont be hateful in replies i do agree with both of you   Their minds will shoot out new ideas faster than most people can absorb them  It s like a rapid fire machine gun but instead of bullets its new ideas for the future  Those with dominant Ne are big picture people  They don t enjoy the details  but will handle them when necessary  Dominant Ne s can see trends and patterns  They are especially good as seeing how things  events and people are connected  They can see the meaning behind people s actions    usagi is not detail oriented put into example when friends like ami is so focused on gathering data before acting when usagi activiely opposes that  she prefers to act fast less thinking more doing  more focused on experiencing everything and like indulging  if thats the right word  in everything at a fast pace  in contrast  as sailor moon will use said data when situation is dire enough  particialurly idk how to spell when helping friends through relationship problems  can   try to understand why did they do that  and how to resolve  on the other hand     When people with dominant Fe go to make a decision  the first decision criteria they use is values rather than objective facts  For extraverted feeling these values are more cultural values and values relating to human kind as a whole  rather than personal values which is what introverted feeling  Fi  is about   Thus people with dominant Fe will fist consider the impact a decision may have on the greater good  and the people around them  They do this instinctively   Contrast this to extraverted thinking  Te   where the decision criteria is based on just facts   Just give me the facts  and keep any emotion or feeling out of it  I just want objective facts and data   Fe and Ne are similar  so i see the skeptics between them  if i could i would actually separate usagi and princess serenity into different profile  but   at this point  vote where your gut tells you to   ,esfj
Ok so here is my reasonment of why i think she is an ENFP  first of all i want to say that please dont rude comments under my comment section  it has happened already and i just dont want that   ok so the first thing we have to take in count is the cognitive functions  ennegream and tritype of usagi  even tho this is mostly about her mbti since we all already agree she was     and  w  i want to still discuss about how this two higly affect her mbti and makes it even harder to clarify what her mbti is       and  w  both are kinda of related  a lot of  w  users are     or atleast that what i have seen  now to understand why is this important lets clarify this from the start  usagi has a really high Fe  but it isnt as high as her Fi neither as high as her Ne  the reason of this is because of  w      having high Fe  me as an ENFP  w      im usually even myself debating if im an ESFJ and a lot of times getting mistyped as ESFJ  this because of the high Fe  w  and     users have  heres a fast explanation of them   The     feels the need to be happy  relaxed  content and sharing experiences with others that are fun and interesting  They are known as the one that is always smiling  the great guy or woman that everyone likes because they are so kind  happy  considerate  helpful and easy to be around    now  this looks a lot like a high Fe rigth  this also looks like an stereotypical ESFJ  wich is kinda funny taking on count that most ESFJ voters accuse ENFP voters of being stereotypical when this exact description wich talks about her     can also be confused as her being an ESFJ  also i wrote this text an hour ago and i just want to add that not being an ESFJ doesnt mean you cant care about your friends or that you dont waqnt harmony with your friendgroup     now that we talked about why does everyone think she is an ESFJ lets talk about why she isnt one and why is she instead a ENFP  Ne   Fi   Te   Si ENFP Fe   Si   Ne   Ti ESj  THE REST IS ON THE REPLIES ,esfj
i see myself a lot in her  she s one of my highest kins in fact  and i usually get mistyped as an ENFP as well  Just because she gets jealous easily and whines a lot  it doesnt mean she s a Fi user aux   and being a Si aux doesnt necessarily mean you re organized  Si can be used for a lot of stuff and yet people just focus on organization  She has always focused on if her environment was in her comfort place  She s incredibly loyal to what she knows from her past and her past life  She stays true to her morals and cherishes her memories so much  She s always looking back on the past and things such as what might ve been  Her Fe dom has always been obvious  but has been outshined by ENFP stereotypes  She always follows what other people feel  Since the first episode  it has been made clear that she follows what s  trending  and acceptable to other people  She s trusting towards other people s feelings because she s always doing as she was told  Seriously  a random talking cat told her to be Sailor Moon and she immediately trusted the cat  Sure the cat is special and all but Fi users would most likely contemplate on trusting the cat more  And when she did transform to sailor moon  her main thoughts were how to get the people to safety instead of how to just let this get over with for her sake  In the whole Mamoru and Chibiusa thing  she was always prioritizing what they both feel instead of her own emotions  Mamoru only listened to Chibiusa when she asked help with that one curry episode  As long as Chibiusa finishes her project  she can set her feelings aside  The whole time during those episodes  her Fe wins almost every time she gets feelings of her own  During the last battle of season    she was already sacrificing her own safety for Rei  Like she said in the   th ep on s    I ll do the rest myself  I ll beat them all and queen baryl  and i ll come home  Rei  go back home ahead of me   she has always prioritized other people s feelings  she only really let go of rei because that is what rei wanted  Every single time she has lost hope  the thing that boosts her right back up are other people  she s easily influenced by other people s moods  She s always trying to lift other people up cause that is what she knows will make her happy as well  Not to mention she s always upset when she fails a test  her first thoughts were always how disappointed her parents and Mamoru would be  She s always trying to do better for her family s sake and always looks back on her mistakes  Just because most ESFJs are labelled smart or responsible  it doesnt mean all of them are  Plus  her Ne isnt as strong as people make it out to be  Ne tert makes perfect sense  her being clumsy and scattered brain doesnt make her a Ne dom  those traits are just a few of the reasons why i relate to her so deeply  I honestly dont know where the ESFP votes are coming from now when it has been so obvious that she whines when shes somewhere unfamiliar to her  She looks more for peace rather than adventure   for her tritype  it has been so obvious that she was always looking out for her relationships a lot with people  so why isnt   in her tritype  it has been made so clear on how anxious she can get with her relationships with the other soldiers  her friends  her family  and mamoru  she fears getting left behind a lot and is afraid to lose her status  someone explain why people think     in her tritype ,esfj
Season   Usagi was definitely an immature ESFJ  Now that I ve gotten to know her  she definitely isn t an ENFP  If we re typing her by letters  then sure  I can agree with that    However  right from the beginning  her dominant Fe is extremely obvious  She constantly uses social values to set her priorities  Oh  the new jewelry shop is trendy  Let s head there instead of studying  Oh  I have to transform and defeat this monster  Fine  but only because that s what Luna says is the right thing to do    That s not to say that Usagi just mindlessly follows what other people tell her to do  On the contrary  Usagi has her own guidelines on what s right or wrong  The thing is  It s very much centered on her relationships  She decides to sacrifice herself to save the other Sailors during the second season  She reverted time and erased her own memories in order to keep those around her safe and happy at the cost of her own memories    Additionally  there are multiple times in the series where her magic fails her  She was so afraid of meeting the expectations of others that she doubted herself in the process  Usagi is a social creature that thrives on communication  It s why she was so determined to change herself when Mamoru began pushing her away    I think you can see her Fe more in Crystal than in the original series  Or  maybe it s hindsight that s making it obvious to me  Either way  I m glad that she s finally getting the type that she deserves  Congrats  ESFJs  ,esfj
If we re talking functional stacks  I think the closest thing to Usagi s functional stack is that of the INFP  But she heavily extraverts her Fi in a way that  while not impossible  is unusual   I think that s part of what makes her such a special person character  I think it s also part of the reason for the ENFP ESFJ discord  She s a high Ne user but a dominant feeler who shows facets of what could be both Fi and Fe  and she s very extroverted  and none of INFP ENFP ESFJ covers all those bases unless you call her an  extroverted INFP    which is fine with me  but I m also fine with the idea of  ENFP who uses Fi more than Ne  to avoid the  extroverted introverted type  contradiction   The real ESFJ among the senshi is Makoto  and the differences between someone like her and someone like Usagi are obvious  Makoto is practical  concrete  and down to Earth  while Usagi is a head in the clouds dreamer and idealist  Makoto is mature and kind of motherly big sisterly  while Usagi is very much a child at heart  Makoto has more of a sense of social decorum  while Usagi is just authentic no matter how silly or strange or even impolite she might seem  Makoto is a more structured and organized person  while Usagi is spontaneous and go with the flow  These are all common patterns for ESFJs and INFPs    Usagi has the strongest personal values and ideals of the lot  and will fight for them no matter how impractical or risky or seemingly impossible  long after everyone else has given up  She has the hopeless romanticism  sense of wonder  and sense of the inherent sacredness and beauty of life that are common among Fi doms  She is also exceptionally open minded and embracing of all kinds of people s individuality  as INFPs and ENFPs tend to be   Someone claimed that she s portrayed as an ENFP in the  filler  of the show and as an ESFJ in the serious parts  I don t think that s true  Both her silly  spontaneous  childlike nature and her strong ideals  deep care for others  and capacity to be serious and determined when fighting for those things are very consistent with an Fi Ne type  Valuing other people or social harmony is not exclusive to Fe types  Fi types can value those things too  and can value most anything as long as it comes authentically from their heart ,esfj
So here s the problem or the main issue reason for the strong split in the MBTI typing  Canon episodes and filler episodes have different personalities for Usagi  In all canon episodes she is ESFJ  In all filler episodes the anime writers made her ENFP  I have voted her ESFJ since that is canon Usagi   As for the enneagram  I knew type   didn t match Usagi all that great  I had initially slotted her as  w   which may again be a canon filler issue   At least as far as canon episodes are concerned  Usagi is a    She is constantly battling anxiety  nervousness  and runaway fears  The seven wing manifests as self indulgences that she uses to anesthetize against the anxiety  She turns to love interests and her close friends to set her mind at ease  Hence sx so  though so sx could be argued as well   If she s worried about life in general  she relies on Mamoru  If she s worried about how she ll pass her next test to avoid getting in trouble with her family  she ll find a friend she can study with copy off of  In short  binging on video games  food  boys  and hanging out with friends to stave off a major case of the worries is the entire Usagi story in a nutshell   w  makes perfect sense   Disintegration to   can be seen as soon as she starts worrying  She starts running around frantically trying to fix whatever is wrong  and starts working extra hard and diligent to try to rush and fix her problem  Usually this frantic energy lasts a day  and then she is back to old bad habits   When she transforms into Sailor Moon that is when courage mode is engaged  She integrates to    and becomes a much more calm and collected version of herself with clear and organized thinking emotions ,esfj
Why is there always a vote war between ENFP and ESFJ on here   They do give off the same vibe though  but they don t share the same judging axis ,esfj
S  lembrando que um surdo mudo pode ser extrovertido  o que define isso   a vontade de estar em meio a outras pessoas ,esfj
Fe Ti on the auxiliary tertiary axis naturally tries to find a reason for the actions and reactions of others  in a way even a rationalisation that still maintains the value of emotion  If it were IxFJ  it is likely that she would resent the people who humiliated her for not seeing a plausible reason for it ,esfj
Can someone explain Fe Si over Si Fe  I m having trouble seeing her as an Fe dom tbh ,esfj
Let s be honest if she were an INFP   she probably wouldn t forgive the people who bully her so easily   ,esfj
Okay  I m not a pro at this or anything so maybe I m wrong but I felt like she was more of an Fe dom while watching the movie  Or I thought she was at least gonna be EXXX but the ISFJ votes think otherwise I guess jsjddj idk I m still sticking with Fe dom though,esfj
ESFJ makes sense  because of fe but I still think she is an introvert  not because of her deafness  Yeah functions are important but it doesn t mean being an extrovert and introvert is nothing  Si dom    I think she always do the same things and give shoya another chance  I know it s not enough for explaining her si dom just saying my opinion  ISFJs have high Fe and can be social just like her most extraverted introvert  People vote ESFJ because of Fe but ISFJ have aux Fe  high fe so ISFJ makes sense too She is hard to type but I rather ISFJ si fe ,esfj
Now that I think about it  she s a bit more sociable than Ishida  And of course I m not saying that introverts can t be sociable  I think ESFJ fit her quite well ,esfj
Ok didn t she forgive Shouya for bulling her and everyone bullied her and when Shouya started to get bullied she was erasing the bad words on his table   ISFJ wants to have lots of friends  if you searched  why is Shoko ISFJ   Shoko s aim to have     friends and she has set a goal that calls for diligent and methodical work  ESFJ voters can you explain   please put it down in the comment  and THANK YOU    ,esfj
To be honest I am not sure why his Se is higher than his Fi  his character is mostly about him reacting strongly  dramatically and emotionally in any situation given which I think is very Fi   also the way he protected tanjiro s box after he told him that in that box there is something really precious to him  zenitsu believed through his personal feelings that protecting the box was the right thing to do and he didn t hold himself back from fighting inosuke when the box was in danger   I am still new to MBTI so I am really sorry if I said something wrong  If you guys don t mind you can give me examples of his Se and why it is his dominant function rather than Fi  I m open to change my mind anytime   ,esfp
He is cute I love him    I don t remember so much about kny but I can see Se dom in he,esfp
Okay  so I just rewatched the whole show  and he explicitly said that the thing he wants most  is to find people he can protect and stick with forever  and to not be left alone like everyone did  That sounds much like sixes core motivations to me  I am kinda new to the whole typology stuff though  so correct me if anything doesn t make sense and ill reconsider my vote   ,esfp
There is nothing xSFP about him ,esfp
From what I ve concluded  Zenitsu seems to be part of an MBTI subtype that uses the dominant and auxiliary function equally  This means we ll need to type him by his tert and inferior functions  so right now I m leaning towards ISFP ,esfp
As an ISFP I relate alot to Zenitsu and he s instantly my favourite character in the series  Usually I would have quite easy time to differentiate ESFP and ISFP but in this Zenitsu s case I m honestly not sure  Don t see neither Dominant Fi or Dominant Se on this guy  Maybe because he s a side character with not enough screen time to show his Fi  can be tricky to convey  and for the Se dom case  he s very afraid  all the time and unsure of his physical ability  A Se dom would usually be bolstered and confident in their physical ability and in the least  physical presence  His  moments  of genius fightings are all taken when he s unconscious  I don t see how s that Se dom     For ISFP case  I don t see Ni tert in this guy either  Fi Ni axis makes ISFP alot more introspective than ESFP   So ESFP wins ,esfp
Lol he s all about Fi and how things make him feel constantly  He s actually extremely relatable character  I find myself to be very similar to him in being dramatic and complaining alot  Needing others to cater to me  reassure me  take care of me etc  He s  w  because he always wants to run away from fear pain uncomfortable feelings  which is core fear of    He has no sense of responsibility like core    he said he always attempted to escape from his grandfather training him  His first instinct is to run away from anything he doesn t enjoy doing ,esfp
Hm  how could someone with an Inferior intuition function be a type    Type   heavily revolves around intuitive like expressions  Reminder that type   is quite possibly the most intellectual of the ennea types due to their skeptical and theoretical nature that moves away from realism  eg  hyper vigilance  that is on the lookout for hidden meanings  clues  and the unusual   Not only is the ineffectualness or generalized problem with doing of the more timid Type VI individuals a consequence of an excessive orientation to the abstract and theoretical  but seeking refuge in intellectual activity is also a consequence of fearful holding back  indirectness  vagueness  and beating around the bush  ,esfp
Can someone explain why sp sx over sp so ,esfp
Because it s not ISFP it s been a long time since the anime ended but it seemed more inward oriented  It seemed to me that he had more Fi than Se  He was more focused on his own feelings ,esfp
I can easily see her as inferior fi with fe demon But inferior Ni  No I don t think so  she is supper straight forward  business career oriented  blunt and future oriented when it comes to her career choices She uses Se a lot  but it s not more evident than her Te  People who lean more towards extroversion especially in extreme examples tend to have this overwhelming desire towards using their extroverted functions  she is an example  Te and Se are the main functions in her  but inferior Ni does not make sense to me,esfp
I think that her being Se dominant is so obvious and also how did people miss the SLE beta quadra vote also   She s definitely Se as her first function  but her Ti is also clear in how she is very precise and rigid in her actions  not really showing the empathetic and gentle personality people with high socionics Fi would  She is actually quite the opposite of that  since she is so confrontational and bold in that way  having more of a more exacting and concrete system in how she operates  making her appear very Te in MBTI  She is not SEE  SLE beta quadra makes most sense,esfp
Maybe I m wrong  but I think EIE is more likely than SEE  She seems to have too much Fe  even for an SEE  and I think she seems to lack a certain groundedness  for lack of a better term  of an SEE  She seems significantly more aristocratic than democratic as well  CD subtype as very likely IMO  Perhaps an Se accentuation though ,esfp
I saw some people voting ESFP saying that people who are voting ENTJ are doing that because she s bossy and gives the vibes of an ENTJ Like my question is are you sure you are not voting her ESFP cuz she s promiscuous  Like are you sure you are not stereotyping just like they are  Cuz I highly highly doubt you aren t doing that ,esfp
Te dom votes     What  I only saw steriotypical arguments for Te that can be simply explained by the fact she is enneagram   and she is choleric  people ALWAYS forgets that MBTI is an ANALYTICAL DECISION MAKING STUDY  not behavioral  Behavior and social interactions are studied in Eneagram Socionics Temperaments not MBTI  Also   arguments for Ni aux or Fi inf   Se dominant HEALTHY characteristics     Realistic    Persuasive   Adaptable   Practical   Discerning   Se dominant UNHEALTHY characteristics     Impulsive   Anxious   Addicted to external stimuli   Superficial   Materialist  She presented BOTH Healthy Unhealthy Se dom characteristics during her career  One thing important to point it out   Te Se is consequentialist  Nicki Minaj is ANYTHING but consequentialist  she doens t think much before acting  she love taking risks  pulling up fights she is not sure she can always win  very impulsive   core towards confrontation too  She does not care about consequences   Te users are  organized  pragmatic  concerned about data and facts  Where Nicki has ever been pragmatic   Now let s talk about her inexistent Fi  Where she ever used Fi     Where in life Nicki Minaj worried about moralism or gave a damn about what she thinks is  the right thing     Please do not use her first songs as arguments  EXPRESSIVE WORKS DOENS T MAKE PEOPLE HAVE HIGH FI  If that were true every singer would be EXFP ou IXFP  and people make that mistake a lot  lmao    w  loves talking about themselves and about what they have conquered  And she did that alot    Now let s talk about why I think she is Se Ti not Se Fi  Ti aux    Ti is what fuels their drive to understand the world  as well as their focus on mastering hands on skills and talents  It comes second in their  functional stack   and it operates mostly in their subconscious  It primarily does analysis on the ideas that their Se creates based on their experiences  It provides a logical framework and reference material to determine which ideas are logical and which are not  and to figure out how they might be implemented  Because Ti is serving Se  it primarily seeks knowledge as a  tool  that can be wielded to solve problems      Ti users are sharp  possibly catching you a bit off guard  Ti users may feel apologetic afterwards  because low Fe can make them sensitive to the other person s negative reaction    ESTP are known for being the  entrepreneurs   The Ti aux is an excellent independent worker  and that s Nicki Minaj  the thing she is most proud off is her ability to write all your rhymes  produce individually all her lyrics and the fact she MADE her own empire with her core abilities  This woman is the definition of aux Ti   Let s compare her social working with and actual Te terc  Card B   Te terc are known for being hard headed and hard to work with  because the Te terc feeds the selfish Fi aux needs to have everything the way they want    Why Card B as an example  Search for EVERY testimonial of a person who worked with her  Abusive  bossy  hard to work with in general  Not an single person enjoyed working with her  And I have billions of other Te terc examples having that feature  Karol Conk    ix ine      Fe terc are way better to work with  more charismatic and more persuasive than Te terc    Search for any testimonial of people that worked with Nicki Minaj  and I m not talking about celebrities  I m talking about choreographers  makeup artists  producers  photographers    etc  This woman has Fe terc  her relationship with fans are very different from ESFP celebrities   Nicki is a great example of ESTP  w   i m not saying that she is healthy  she is human after all  but I think she is an very Human example for this tipology ,esfp
Her social blindness makes her so savage and that s coming from an     Not sure if  w  or  w  though ,esfp
what are the arguments on sp    wouldn t social   make more sense than self preservation     soc     The Social Three desires influence above all and tends to skillfully read and adjust to the social norms and requirements of teams or organizations  Highly competitive  they enjoy being in the spotlight and confidently market their ideas and accomplishments  Looking good and successful is very important and they may cut corners or cover up failure  so long as the finished product makes them and their team look good    sp     The self preservation Three is a countertype in that they dislike advertising their strengths and accomplishments overtly  and avoid being seen as image oriented  In spite of this it is important to them to be recognised for their hard work and excellence  This subtype is reliable  efficient and productive and aspires to do the right thing  Their pursuit of security and self sufficiency through hard work may lead to workaholism    source ,esfp
I get the whole ENTJ vibe of her  like she fits the stereotypes of them and all but where is the dom Te  I feel like acting  tough  is one of the things Nicki and many other celebrities do to touch up their celebrity appearence  Not to say Nicki is fake and all but I guess it is amusing for them  I ve been scrolling and have not seen a good Te argument and even more so how she is Ni Se  Si Ne would even make more sense  in my subjective point of view  ,esfp
Te Fi axis is clear  i don t think we need to argue on that  and so is Se Ni but does anyone have arguments on why her Se would be higher than her Te  i ve seen ENTJ arguments being more convincing where most ESFP arguments just say   not every hardworking person is ENTJ   or   ESFP has Te tert which can be well used   and not a single good argument as to why Se and Fi would be higher than Te and Ni    reminding you guys that this is not a rude comment  i m genuinely opened to any opinions  especially because i don t know her very well  but keep in mind that saying that as an ESFP she still uses Te doesn t prove anything and neither builds a good  convincing argument ,esfp
i thought she was an ENTJ for a bit  until you realise the two situations that have happened recently with jade from little mix and the vaccine thing  she put her Fi over being liked for her opinion on both issues  even having the whole  you can t say anything nowadays  statement everyone says  Te isnt  being ambitious  it is organising information for efficiency and keeping a logical mind  with the blackfishing one its less clear  but the vaccine thing she      used her Fi ,esfp
really fun combination i know lmao,esfp
Why are so many childhood friends ESFP ,esfp
ISTP  w  ESFJ and an ISFP don t know what his ennegram is yet but his twin is the ESFP a,esfp
I understood some functions more well  it didn t matter who  she was trying to make a good environment for everyone  she is still the same till today  i love that a lot   ,esfp
ANNOYING BUT COOL IT IS LITERALLY A CONTRADICTION   I explained on another page in the same category  your best friend s type  is there if you want to know in more detail,esfp
the two of us and our younger siblings would play superheroes  she was always girl girl  her superpowers were being rich and girl power  it made for some interesting last minute saves though ,esfp
My best childhood friends   INFJ  We would listen to stories and build legos  he was extremely creative and we would often plan out pranks for people   ISFJ  He was very kind and a lovely person to be around  although he had a rivalry with the INFJ   ESFJ  I never related to her very well  but she came up to me and directly asked if I wanted to be her friend  She eventually messed with my head and I cut her out of my life ,esfp
a n seguimos siendo amigas y nos llevamos muy bien  pero a veces me gustaria que volvieramos a ser solo ella y yo   ,esfp
Why we were friends for so long I have no clue  She s a lovely person we are just so fundamentally incompatible LOL ,esfp
I don t understand how we were friends  Ne is just so overwhelming  Our friendship was bound to end eventually,esfp
i dont think you people know as much about cognitive functions as you think you do,esfp

how do you guys see anything but ENFP   ,esfp
hi guys    i think luffy is an  w    ,esfp
Damn Daniel               ,esfp
Luffy screams ESFP  literally lol   he s one of if not the only character we never see inner dialogue for  he always acts on impulse and his only plan of attack is to hit the bad guy until he doesn t get back up  he has an uncanny ability to befriend anyone he meets  and he always acts on what he believes is right and will defend his friends even at the cost of his own life,esfp
anyway    luffy   agenda blah blah blah    finally on wano   even More sure now      literally law says  he s always doing whatever he wants  like every   seconds man    it just feels so obvious  i would add more  but i feel like my previous comments on here explain well enough  luffy    so true ,esfp

SX   is literally the worst take in history  Sx   is cold  appears calm and composed  logical  strategic  a planner  avoids relationships    sx   is dramatic  emotional  entitled  histrionic  overtly sexual  addicted to love  What kind of   would die the way she did  Her only sx   trait is aggressiveness and mistrust ,esfp
In fact I think Enneagram   votes have quite a few worthy points  the violent way in which she reacted after being rejected and not contributed with her love or attention and vowed revenge could have been a disintegration in  ,esfp
Best character on the show ,esfp
I m voting ESFJ  but a wicked unhinged ESFJ that probably had experienced some major traumas  She reads people s emotions out loud  reference past things  Si  and can flirt like her life depends on it  If you want a master flirt  that likes to therapize you at the same time  you bring in the ESFJ  Imho ,esfp
If you think she s   you need to go read an Enneagram book  She s   or    clear   anxious and safety seeking and   fun loving debauched amoral behaviour ,esfp
Worst character on the show ,esfp
it s pretty hard to differ some sx  from sx  tho so I think both are really good options for her,esfp
Queen of unhealthy sx  s   But just in case anyone still needs some convincing  consider this  She s player      right                         w   I mean  Come on guys  it really couldn t be more obvious     Seriously  if this doesn t prove beyond all doubt what her enneagram is once and for all  I don t know what will           All jokes aside though  I actually really do think she s more of a   than a    ,esfp
 Sexual Twos strive to forge intimate  passionate connections with others  Through seduction and charm they hope to win exclusive relationships with people  to share secrets with others and to be shared with  They re not content to be just someone s friend  they want to be the  best  friend   the confidante and number one kindred spirit  Giving lots of attention to people is one of the ways that they charm and seduce  they may learn everything about their partner or friends  interests in order to have something to share in common  They are also good at listening and discussing the problems and struggles of their friend or partner and enjoy these intimate  confidential conversations  People who seem distant or uninterested are especially fascinating to the Sexual Two and they may be especially driven to win them over  Underneath their generous  passionate exterior  the Sexual Two may be anxious about their desirability  Thus  they turn on the charm in order to find validation and love  This Two is usually direct  action oriented  and dominant  They believe in love conquering all and will do nearly anything to gain affection and closeness   Healthy Sexual Twos are deeply romantic without any ulterior motives  They give out of unconditional and selfless love  rather than hoping to get a  blank check  they can use to ask anything of the loved one  They are empathetic  supportive  protective  and inspirational  Unhealthy Sexual Twos are pushy and demanding  unable to take no for an answer  They try to keep all their friends apart because they re afraid of being dismantled as the  number one intimate   They are prone to jealousy  possessiveness  and obsessive behavior  ,esfp
This has been going through my head recently  so I wanted to know what do you think of the possibility that Sasha would actually be a SP    Now that I think about it  I really have a hard time seeing the mischievous  play boy girl  nature of an SP   in Sasha   I think a good example of a SP   in this anime could be Hitch  she s a great networker   street savvy   who knows how to take advantage of the opportunities that arise and make deals that benefit her in her search for fun and pleasure   Is Sasha like that  I don t think so  She s much more laid back  calm  and even indolent when dealing with conflict  as when Ymir teased her for her accent   so I think an assertive type as a core might not be the best choice  In this way  her love for food could be understood as the defense mechanism of a SP    who seek to numb themselves through activities that fill their appetites  eating  drinking  watching TV  etc    while SO   as a secondary instinct would also explain her need to merge into a group and serve to its causes   So yeah    I d like to hear someone else s opinion on this  I still don t rule out the possibility that she s indeed a    but the SP suptype still seems a bit out of place to me ,esfp
she is a very clear se dom  I can t understand the ENFP votes,esfp
Only reason people type her as an ENFP is because of stereotypes  She is very in touch with her surroundings and doesn t really seem to have any Ne,esfp
So sad to lose her she was the source of comforting to her mates in their dark world,esfp
someone explain to me why she s ESFP when her ni is literally top notch  how can her ni be inferior ,esfp
the HELL is going on this page   I know I did not see someone type Sasha as an INTJ or an ENFJ,esfp
I have absolutely no clue why she s typed as an ESFP on here  She s a textbook INFP  Just because she s comic relief doesn t mean she s an ESFP  ,esfp
Wow  she s amazing I love her so much and she is definitely a se dom   ,esfp
The fact that other people in her squad refer her as  The girl with unusual fine instinct  in the context of a huntress living in the woods with her father  is enough proof for the case of Se dom   Case closed  thank you ,esfp
I voted her as so sp over sp sx because she s very stereotypically soc dominant   speaking in a polite way so as not to give the  wrong impression  about where she comes from  clinging on to the traditions of her village for longer than she needed to  and primarily caring about their wellbeing first and foremost  Soc seeks to feel part of something larger than themselves  which is why she is angry for both herself and her community when she feels their game is in danger of being scared away   she is worrying for them collectively  Self preservation seeks to meet its needs but I don t see her sacrificing soc just to maintain her needs  ya know  Compared to Mikasa  who doesn t give much thought to anyone beyond her small circle of friends  Sasha is overly concerned with what people think of her   Obviously soc doesn t manifest as these behaviours all the time  but immature soc is very protective over how it is percieved by others  as well as who is and isn t in its  group     I think a lot of her compulsive eating is more to do with type    which is gluttonous in nature  especially when under stress  Sp is about comfort and boundaries   needing to feel okay in yourself first and foremost  Sasha just stuffs her face  It s less about regulating her needs and more just    really really enjoying food   Also voted     as I don t think she displays any reactivity whatsoever   s possess a sense of shame and innate incompleteness for being  different  from others  Sasha barely  if ever  seems to have these kinds of thoughts  Even with the   and   fixes     s still struggle with those feelings and perceptions of themselves  Meanwhile Sasha truly is driven to help others and doesn t seem to desire any help in return  She s competent no matter what when the situation asks for it   ESFP is very obvious too  although  again  her   exaggerates a lot of the stereotypical ESFP traits   there are plenty of ESFPs with complex thoughts  and she s just not one of them   She is driven by her Se and Fi  hyperaware of changes and differences in her environment whilst keeping her values constantly at the end of every major decision she makes  She sees Gabi and is aware of what she intends to do but cannot bring herself to cross her own values and kill her first    sasha i miss you   ,esfp
Uhhh can someone explain   fix And also inf ni is too obvious for her to be ne dom  dunno why theres so many votes of ENFP,esfp
There s      going to be some big twist with her  I just hope she s still an ESFP when it turns out she s the malevolent god of time or smth  I have never seen a twist villain ESFP so it d be cool beans,esfp
Its kind of funny to know that her English voice actor has the same mbti  since it fits the character itself,esfp
Ok but like why Inquisitive for Paimon  Like for the most part she has a hard time understanding certain concepts  theories and usually Traveler has to simplify it for Paimon  An example is during the current Dragonspine event so spoiler alert if u haven t done it yet       While Albedo and Paimon were discussing abt their stories  only Traveler could spot that in Albedo s story  it wasn t fiction but rather it had something to do with the current situation ,esfp
ngl shes an ESE  her socio fe si ego and  D se is so damn obvious  and i dont think she has suggestive si or role se at all  Also  shes defo an ni polr  she is so triggered by socio ni stuff lmao    also she seems to be very confident in choosing aesthetics  food  comfort and socio si stuff  Also she seems to be very confronting lol like how an socio se user would    also btw obvious ESFP  Se dom  she mainly wants to live and the present and tangible reality and she cares about  right now   Fi  she cares a lot about her personal values  and her values truly come from inward  Te  she is really objective and straightforward about logical stuff and only trusts hard and external data Ni inf  obvious ni inf  she barely even think about the consequences of her quick reactions    she says and does stuff without thinking,esfp

sorry  but social   where  ,esfp
in what world is ron a social       he s so obviously a self pres   it s embarrassing for everyone who s voted social    the social   is   like  most valuing social causes or similar that they can latch onto and find security in  while the self pres   is much more focused on finding security in being liked by people and cultivating connections that they can rely on  stop separating instinctual variants and core types ,esfp
still trying to understand the ENFP votes   ,esfp
He s probably ESFP  I just wanna say it s pretty good Si to remember the exact sounds Harry made to open the Chamber of Secrets without knowing parseltongue ,esfp
que homem gostoso gzuis ,esfp
How does Ron have a   fix  He definitely seems more   fix to me  He has a hair trigger temper and doesn t at all try to repress his anger  instead letting it loose on everyone  He doesn t seem conflict averse to me at all  He s very reactive  and has no problems with confronting someone  He s provoked easily  and has no qualms with expressing his opinions  like how bluntly disgusted and shocked he was when he found out Lupin was a werewolf   Ron is also protective over people close to him  especially Ginny   and that is another   trait  not saying other types can t be protective  but overall   s and people with an   fix tend to take on a protective role with people they re close to  ,esfp

Eu vejo Bolsonaro mais como um Te dom que queria aplicar de forma objetiva aqui no Brasil suas percep  es subjetivas de mundo ideal criadas ao longo de sua vida pelo seu Si  Em outras palavras  ele se viu inspirado no que passou pelo ex rcito  na tradi  o crist  e no tipo de educa  o que ele recebeu quando jovem no ex rcito de Lei e Ordem  e ele coloca isso acima at  de valores morais individuais durante o processo    um sinal de Te e Si bem forte acima de Fi    Aqui nesse texto vou mostrar v rios quotes do pr prio Carl Jung sobre as fun  es cognitivas   Te     Extraverted thinking  therefore  need not necessarily be a merely concretistic thinking it may equally well be a purely ideal thinking  if  for instance  it can be shown that the ideas with which it is engaged are to a great extent borrowed from without  i e  are transmitted by tradition and education  The criterion of judgment  therefore  as to whether or no a thinking is extraverted  hangs directly upon the question  by  p       which standard is its judgment governed     It seems constantly to be affected by objective data  drawing only those conclusions which substantially agree with these  Thus it gives one the impression of a certain lack of freedom  of occasional short sightedness  in spite of every kind of adroitness within the objectively circumscribed area    Si     Even with only a slight reinforcement of the unconscious  the subjective constituent of sensation becomes so alive that it almost completely obscures the objective influence  The results of this are  on the one hand  a feeling of complete depreciation on the part of the object  and  on the other  an illusory conception of reality on the part of the subject  which in morbid cases may even reach the point of a complete inability to discriminate between the real object and the subjective perception    Ent o sim  os julgamentos de Te podem ficar presos a percep  es subjetivas do usu rio criadas pelo Si    o caso do Bolsonaro  Ent o ficar preso a  opini es subjetivas  n o   uma caracter stica especificamente de Fi  todo mundo pode ter uma opini o subjetiva afinal de contas  Fi tamb m n o   sobre ser  burro  ou fazer decis es irracionais  aposto que teve gente que votou em Bolsonaro ESFP por isso  Fi   uma fun  o de julgamento racional  que se preocupa com o processo moral   Em ess ncia  o Fi est  relacionado a seguir profundamente os seus valores morais ao longo da vida  a continuar julgando tudo internamente em rela  o aos valores morais  como um equil brio para a sua pr pria identidade     Fi   uma fun  o bastante sens vel  que se preocupa profundamente com os valores morais  intensamente  a ponto de se vincular   sua autenticidade  individualidade  sentido de si mesmo   Fi     The depths of this feeling can only be divined    they can never be clearly comprehended  It makes men silent and difficult of access  with the sensitiveness of the mimosa  it shrinks from the brutality of the object  in order to expand into the depths of the subject  It puts forward negative feeling judgments or assumes an air of profound indifference  as a measure of self defence      Praticamente o contr rio de Bolsonaro   Bolsonaro sendo uma pessoa silenciosa  que assume ar de indiferen a como medida de auto defesa  Bolsonaro sendo uma pessoa sens vel  Bolsonaro sendo uma pessoa que se preocupa com valores morais  Discordo completamente  Eu n o vejo Fi qualquer nele  Uma das coisas que mais me incomoda no Bolsonaro   justamente a falta de Fi dele  Bolsonaro n o   uma pessoa sens vel que se preocupa com valores morais  ele   um cara que deseja aplicar de forma objetiva as suas percep  es criadas pelo seu Si ao longo de sua vida  no ex rcito por exemplo  SEM LIGAR para os valores morais envolvidos durante o processo   Ele t  muito mais preocupado com aplicar uma esp cie de ditadura baseada em suas concep  es duras de Lei e Ordem doque realmente ser sens vel e se preocupar com os valores morais envolvidos no processo   Al m disso tudo  tem outro ponto bem importante  Fi  e Ti  s o fun  es que se preocupam mais com o Processo  enquanto Te  e Fe  s o fun  es que se preocupam mais com o Resultado   Para Bolsonaro     Resultado   Processo  Logo   Je   Ji     N o se preocupa com valor moral  Logo   Te   Fe  Disso tiramos o Te do Bolsonaro  que   extremamente forte e quer Resultado a qualquer custo  passando por cima de qualquer valor moral relacionado aos indiv duos durante o Processo  Sinal de Te   Fi ,esfp

He s definitely a   no doubt  but why      I don t see him suppressing anger to keep peace  he just faces it  Pretty sure he s     but I m always down to have my mind changed,esfp

Jesse is energised by interacting with the outside world  You can be ambiverted in terms of how you relate to people but it s ultimately about what makes you thrive  Jesse thrives in company ,esfp
Can someone explain why so sx  I don t see so  for him AT ALL ,esfp
could someone explain why he s typed as SEE   i m really not seeing the socio Se base D ,esfp
I see him as a ISFP  Not only is he socially introverted in seasons     he also uses more fi than se  he makes decisions purely based on what he feels is ethically and morally correct  not based on what provides him with the most stimulation,esfp
Having trouble deciding on his Enneagram type    makes sense  I guess  and most other types are obviously not a fit for him  Though when it s discussed  I think the reasons people are dismissing   are based on a false premise  The argument seems to be that he is too emotionally reactive and not hiding his anxiety rather than trying to distract himself and cover it up with optimism  This isn t really true  though   he distracts himself from introspection and anxiety a lot  like after he kills Gale when he hosts huge parties and is clearly doing everything  no matter how self destructive  to distract himself from introspecting about the murder  And he does display some of   s  charlatan  nature  always creating plans and ideas and trying to convince others of their talents that will let them achieve those plans while idealizing everything  This can be seen in his interactions with his friends where he keeps idealizing how much money they will make off selling the meth and trying to persuade them to do it  while dismissing their doubts after Combo is killed or when they think selling to people in rehab is wrong  That said  there are also a lot of cases where he does visibly show his fear and emotional reactivity  so   also makes sense  I m not sure if he is actually   or    just that I don t think he never shows   s ways of dealing with anxiety   He s definitely not so    though  This seems like a case of people voting IVs without paying attention to the type ,esfp
The more I think about it  the less I see him being an ESFP   please also read my comment below   He is NOT getting introverted  because of trauma  It s much more likely he is Fi Ni looping in later seasons which caused his decrease of Se  His Ni is screaming throughout the show  how can it be inferior  Because he doesn t see deeper meaning of a door painting  Zuko  Avatar   Eren Yeager  Attack on Titan   Rio  La casa de Papel   just to name a few other ISFPs where I would expect a similiar mindset  Walt and Jesses differences don t lie on different perceptions  but on how they judge  Walt s biggest problem and frustration about Jesse is him not using his Te  while Jesse s Fi is so big that he hates Walt because of his actions regardless of its logical results  How are they supposed to have the same functions on  nd and  rd spot   I guess because he says yea b     all the time and takes drugs  he has to be Se dom  let s just ignore every other aspect  Like yes  If I would only have seen the first season  I would also first guess ESFP  But please stop ignoring cognitive differences between types  because of  trauma  ,esfp
Why is he Sanguine primary  Sanguine primaries are much more active  whereas Jesse is more jaded and inactive  His friction with Walt stemmed from Jesse s flimsiness and weak work ethic  which is more found in Phlegmatic than Sanguine ,esfp
i can t even describe how much I love this character I don t even think it s possible to love a character so much  Jesse  walter   teamjesse,esfp
HEAR ME OUT  I actually think Gi hun is a      s are abstract  intellectually orientated  complex thinkers  who actually plan and imagine more than go straight into action  Their  hedonism  is more like searching for positive mental states than physical enjoyment   GiHun is not complex  not abstract  not intellectual   he s very simple minded  More focussed on the present and physical  and occasionally the comfy past  than on the future like  s   s are a really ne esk type  think of all the reasons he s ESFP   ENFP for why he s not a      I understand so s are altruist like him  but I don t belive Gihun is altruist for the same reasons  So s are selfless because they want to be seen as a hero  as innocent  as pure and unselfish  and become the centre of attention  Gihun doesn t seem to have this desire  he just believes it is right  He also doesn t repress gluttony like so s  He can share  but won t hide his needs  He even eats when it is considered insensitive  like when he s told his daughter is moving  He also shamelessly demanded money back in front of everyone  violently shaking a young girl  as well as freaking out in gambling booths  His whole life of gambling is pretty anti so  to begin with  the so  does NOT want to be seen as someone greedy and materialist so would not shamelessly and publicly chase money  food  whatever  I think   makes the most sense  They are altruist but not to seem like a hero  it s to build community  His group orientation and focus on comfort and sensory experience suggests E  to me  I d say  w   because all tho he can be aggressive  it s usually out of a sense of self righteousness  and about right and wrong ,esfp
idk if it s because of fi   fe compatibility but he is my favorite character ever since the first episode  his se makes him a bit aggressive  impulsive   quick to react however the way he use his Fi is excellent and creates a great balance between his Se and other functions  i thought he might even be a ISFP due to his strong Fi however his Se is more clear to realize during the show since he is spontaneous  adaptable  always focusing on the present environment and quick to react to his surroundings which can be explained by his Se  also there are some people who thinks that being a Fi user equals to being selfish therefore he should be a Fe user since he s selfless and always considers other people s needs first  being helpful  loyal and good hearted isn t necessarily related to being a Fe user  any personality type can contain those traits  i think we can see in the show that his actions are not based on his desire to  fit in   which is fe  but based on his desire to defend his values   which is fi  he can be adaptable but if he was a Fe user he would be less strict towards his moral beliefs when there s a pressure and would be more likely to maintain harmony in order to survive  however we can see in the show that his sense of morality is stronger than his desire to fit in the group  for example when jang deok su killed a man when he s trying to get his stolen food he was the first one to react   he didn t spent the money he earned because he thought it was morally wrong   he hated sang woo because of how he acted so immorally in order to win the game etc ,esfp
I guessed he was ESFP when he got in the games ,esfp
I love how this guy is so relatable to me except I m way more goal orientated while he just lives and let live  This comment contains some spoilers   Everything he did was due to his Fi  He wanted to right wrongs since he knew many people felt disappointed in him  his mom  his daughter  The only reason he joined the game was to get the money and make up for his mistakes  To do the morally right thing  Even tho he is very caring with others  when we discuss Fe or Fi  we are looking at his decision making system  not his actions  I don t think he ever agreed with group values  nor did he try his best to maintain them  His behaviour would be socially unacceptable at times because he believed he did the right thing  punching his ex wife s new husband for trying to pay him off  threatening the old man after finding out his actions and so on   I think the main reason he joined the game was due to him being in the Ni grip  a grip which he continues to be stuck in after the game  He wanted to create a better future for himself and others  And when he found out he failed  he tried to find a new path to take but he couldn t so he kept on living as a poor unemployed person always thinking about what he could do  He clearly is a Se dom  Always jumping right in and taking on risky   spontaneous behaviours in an attempt to cut corners short  gambling  the game   He also lets the spur of the moment influence his decisions and often his anger too,esfp
Extrovert  He tends to gain energy from other people  Sensing  He s more in the real world  He doesn t really drift off  Feeling  He lets his emotions lead him  Perceiving  He tends to be more of a relaxed person  Sorry if I m wrong,esfp
I think he s ISFP because he s kinda sad,esfp
I think he is most likely an ESFP  it shows in the way he empathizes with others  puts himself in others  shoes and feels bad   sad for them and acts to avoid this displeasure but without evaluating the situation in a rational way and always ends up committing some nonsense  Although obviously not all ESFPs are like that  but this is quite a stereotype  reminds me of Naruto or a little less luffy  I think in the end he does all this for himself  he doesn t want to feel guilty for himself or others  I consider much more coherent sang woo ,esfp
This guy is a little naive  a se dominant user wouldn t trust their life in shady people like his glasses friend ,esfp
Would anyone please explain how is he Se Fi  I was seeing Fe all the time and has been recalling the past everytime he s left with no external influences ,esfp

I love how PDB mass votes a ton of  s   s   s   s  and even sometimes  s  Socrates looking at you  as  s yet when an actual clear as day   comes along they vote them as   or   oh man I hate this website    Anyways read Naranjo s description of SX s she fits so well    A sexual eight has a tendency towards social detachment  He is a rebellious person  much more than the other E   He is also a more provocative person  who flaunts  who proclaims that his values are different from the norm  This occurs with all eight  but in the sexual subtype  this tendency turns into a clear detachment from the intellect  The word to define it is possession  And I used to think that this also had to do with physical possessions  but later I realized that this passion is limited to grabbing the other  the sexual eight is very possessive in their relationships  This word also has to do with taking ownership of the entire scene  the sexual eight always wants to be the center  It is always fascinating  Their power comes from a greater seduction  a greater power of fascination  which differentiates them stylistically from others  The other subtypes do not have as many colors in the feathers  In relation to the other subtypes  the sexual is more emotional  while the conservation is pure action and the social is the only eight intellectual     s are more about thrilling and exhilarating experiences and being fully grounded in reality then they are about  power   which is funny considering her name   This often makes them have a tough and abrasive attitude but this can be confused with power seeking rather than lust seeking  Hope this clarifies some misinformation on Power and her type  how  s work  and how  s work ,esfp
ESFP because she has a really high IQ ,esfp
Power is so ESFP it s actually painful  I have a very in depth comment from almost a year ago so check that out if you want a actual think piece  Here is why she s a Fi and Te user and not a Ti and Fe one    FI  ridicules Denji for trying to say pochita is still alive saying he s lying to console himself  Same thing happens to her with her cat  she tells him she now understands  She cant even begin to understand other people s emotions unless the same thing happens to her  Her own emotions are always the priority to her  until she stops being the most unhealthy Fi user in existence at the very end  When she saves Denji at the chance she might be killed by Makima  she s confused and starts berating herself  Saying she s a Fe user  placing other people s emotions and perceptions of her above her own  would be a literal joke    Denji  Fe user thinking about if he s lost his humanity and sense of self due to his transformation  hmm  Actually nevermind I don t care  Power  Fi user thinking about the concept of placing someone else s life above her own   multiple pages of text    TE  Won t do anything if it doesn t give her the  results that she wants  Something works  She doesn t care how  as long as it continues to function properly  This is the exact opposite of Ti  It s a weak function since it s her third  but it s present    While Denji cares about the emotions of other s  Se Fe being in a very unhealthy cycle for him  and has a weak but still present sense of internal logic  his flaw is his logic is wrong  not that it s not there   Power has an unhealthy reliance on placing her own emotions above other s and viewing logic as a means to an end  Example  they re engineers  Denji has a vague understanding of the inner workings of a car but mostly asks other people to check it for him  he s nervous for their approval  Power doesn t care about how the car works as long as it works and the only approval she cares about is her own ,esfp
h how can she be an INFJ ,esfp
I can see people voting ESTP just because of the massive quantity of  in your face  comic relief moments she gets  but come on  when we first met her  she literally says she hates both humans and demons  says whatever comes to her mind at any given moment  and makes   effort to become less of a pain in the ass to Denji and Aki when living together  which only changes gradually,esfp
i hope when the anime is out people dont suddenly vote for ESTP or ENFP  ,esfp
hold on wait     why     over      i understand it s a bit of a comedic sketch on fujimoto s part and that s why i m not saying she s a core    but her desire to become the ruler of the world and win a nobel prize is uh     pretty   imo LOL,esfp
No lo puedo creer mi diosa power es ESFP como yo que felicidad,esfp
he s unbearable b no one can take it ,esfp
fuggin weirdo lmfao but he is fam and i love him,esfp
He s a MBTI enneagram ecc  fan too  so we talk about this stuff every time we meet each other  He was a bit insecure and childish some years ago  but he has matured a lot  now he s an assertive and equilibrated person  it s very satisfying to discuss with him  One of my favourite people in this moment of my life  even if we don t see each other very often ,esfp
the developed Fe was confusing and she s overall a balanced person  so the  w  threw me off and i read her as a phlegmatic ENTP  now i can see its repressed Fe in childhood now developed and a nice Se aux Ni tertiary duo ,esfp

    is such an unhinged tritype and this is the worst Fe I ve ever seen someone have it s like dog water  I actually like her and miss her though we just stopped talking,esfp

Only had to watch the first episode with her  Se Dom os actually obvious and personally  I see more Fi than Ti an her  Idk how to explain that one bit like her acting her reactions and decisions usually seem connected to her own feelings  principles etc ,esfp
she is literally the meaning of an inferior Ni and a dominant Se  diving into the warzone like an absolute dumbass  difficulties deducing solutions to the current situation  always wanting the full details  keeping things simplified as she can  so focused on what s happening now and can t think a second in the future the Niccolo situation was even a better illustration of her inferior Ni    when he asked about killing Sasha she didn t think of the reason behind his question and answered him naively  lack of emotions reading and deep understanding of the situation    the definition of an unhealthy ESFP  still even after reading the manga my least favorite character   ,esfp
She is one of the most intelligent ESFP characters  she is brave  strong and did her best for her people even if she would live for    years only for me she is like Eren but she is smarter than him actually and in the end she chose the right path in the managa  for me she did nothing wrong she was just a brainwashed and traumatized child and I can t blame her for killing Sasha ,esfp
why   in her tritype  could someone explain ,esfp
pretty obvious  w   she achieves to be higher than others for herself  but i think she has   in her tritype for SURE  she is always doing what she believes is right  this is shown when she killed    someone   because she thought it was right  ,esfp
She is a true ESFP  I know why people can be mistyped her as ENFP due to how developed her Ne and Te are    She is cunning  and probably one of the smartest ESFP represent in anime ,esfp
Story time  Gabi made me realize that my own high strung attitude  irritability  and strong opinions were actually a   fix rather than an   fix ,esfp

Isn t she more likely   than   in tritype  Social   can also remind of   because they seek for rules  And Gabi feels good when there are rules gave by Marley  She doesn t understand how she can not obey them and is completely feared out in Paradis constantly thinking about her country and what she should do to be safe with them again ,esfp
She s definitely a Ti blind   If I were in her place  I would probably think of  Should I get on the zeppelin  Will there be no more soldiers there  They can kill me instantly   I m just a    year old brat  probably they won t even take me seriously  I m too lazy to take a revenge LMAO  and  She couldn t be able to understand Falco s feelings cause she s too superficial She boasts of her own military skills  feats and doesn t care how others feel ,esfp
Social   Kirishima is extremely cursed lol   The social   is described by Naranjo as cold  formal and adhering to rules and authority the most out of the   subtypes and they re often mistaken as enneagram  s  Highly rational and dutiful  they are strict and work to encourage compliance to rules or collective norms  and to ensure that everyone knows what is expected of them  Even Iida fits the archetype of social   better than Kirishima   How the hell is that Kirishima  Dude is literally rambunctious asf  I have no opinions on his enneatype as it has been a while since I gave up on this show but if he is indeed a    then sx   would make the most sense    On another note  yall arguing for   core  Seriously  Screw the subtypes for    Make sure he fits into the core passions  ego fixations and trait structure of a   before arguing for any subtype in particular    Type  s  passion of sloth causes them to be inert and unrealistically idealistic as they withdraw in order to keep their peace  I really can t see Kirishima as part of the withdrawn triad in any way   s mute their inner passion or fire as they deafen their inner voice due to psychological inertia and they are empathetic and flexible as a means of ignoring developing their individuality  With how loud and over the top Kirishima is about his idea of manliness and stuff I don t think he s a   honestly ,esfp
Curious where ya ll see Si with this guy,esfp
literally the humanization of ESFJ  even compared to mina ashido  kirishima is not so impulsive and is more focused on the comfort of others than on having fun with them  it is the third ne and the last ti that are traced when he is under stress  criticism of himself  with the questions  can I really  is he worthy of it    and in principle his entire teenage phase burdened him with this    seriously  I looked at him and in my head right away  wow  this is fe dom   english is not my native language  so I m sorry if I m not being very clear ,esfp
Oh boy I can tell by the votes here that my take is gonna be real spicy    This is copy pasted from a conversation I had on another profile   For Kirishima  most of the show I thought SEE  Definitely Se base  Very ambitious and competitive  I figured SEE cuz he was able to make friends and comes off as way less off putting than Bakugo  SLE   however I just finished season   and after seeing him in the Shie Hassaikai arc I ve changed my mind to SLE  The key issue is that he didn t get much focus in the first   seasons  but in the Shie Hassaikai arc we get a whole episode dedicated to his past and internal motivations  He backs up his Se base with a clear and internally consistent code of conduct about being  manly   which he has his own personal definition for  where many toxic or evil things that are associated with traditional masculinity by society are not regarded as  masculine  by Kirishima  In his worldview  a man needs to be strong and powerful and use this to defend the weak  and this worldview is what motivates him to become a hero in the first place  This sort of internal code is strongly associated with Ti  He creates an internal code of conduct around manliness to motivate him  but Se is still his base function as he is primarily motivated by ambition and success  with Ti playing a supporting role   Compare him to someone like Korra from Legend of Korra  She s also competitive  ambitious  etc  but unlike Kirishima the extent of her worldview is  fight bad guys   She doesn t have any sort of consistent code like Kirishima does  Instead she judges other people  and the world in general  through instinctive moral judgement  In her mind  there are good people and bad people  and she fights bad people until there are no more bad people  except she never articulates this into an internal code  Her motivations are entirely instinctual and not based on an internally consistent worldview like Kirishima   I was very resistant to the idea of SLE Kirishima at first because comparing him to Bakugo is like night and day  however Bakugo is himself a VERY stereotypical  VERY over the top  and VERY unhealthy SLE  And even then comparing Kirishima to Bakugo still supports SLE  since Bakugo also has an internally consistent ideology around what it means to be a hero  primarily centered around strength  and it is this ideology that causes him to refuse the offer to join the League of Villains rather than moral opposition  Though Bakugo is much more exaggerated and unhealthy than Kirishima  they both have their own internally consistent ideologies which guide their actions   One argument against this would be that All Might  ESE  has an internal ideological motivation to become the symbol of peace  however I don t think that really counts as Ti as that seems more motivated by All Might s emotional understanding of others and understanding of how these emotions impact society as a whole  It s not really a code that he lives by the way Bakugo and Kirishima have  it s more of an image he wants to project to the world   In fact  the personality portion of his My Hero Academia wiki page supports this     Kirishima s whole thing about  reinventing  his identity to match his internal views seems very in line with balanced Ti and Fe   In addition  he doesn t hold back comparing himself to Bakugo  and Midoriya even called their friendship  a relationship between equals   Kirishima is the only person Bakugo seems to actually respect and is willing to accept help from  This seems more like two SLEs with mutual respect for each other  Though this could apply the same if Kirishima is SEE  however I feel like I made a good case for SLE earlier  this part is just icing   I absolutely cannot see ESE at all  I d consider SEE still  but not ESE ,esfp
Why not a Fe user     i think Fe Fi but I still don t know    ,esfp

Mostly the same as what people think  just let me explain myself   ESFP  huge Se  always shouting and full of energy   When I saw my bro in trouble and I couldn t do anything   whatever the rest of the line is  He literally couldn t sit still when people were out in the action  Fi is obvious with his whole backstory  te comes from him trying to be the best  even when it hurts  Ni is tricky  he does seem a little formal and well thought out  but that s not really concrete  Still  he might just have a weak Ni   w   literally when I look for healthy  w s  I think of him immediately       I know     makes sense  but I wanted to explain some parts of this one too  Kiri s been in an uphill battle his whole life against expectations and what he wants to get done  He s kindhearted  but he s also determined and steely  He s broken down walls and accidentally hurt people before in his attempts to rise  but he always comes back to apologize and lift his opponents up too  Maybe a mixture of     and      Ooh  remember that     is the most balanced type too  they seek inner harmony through their parts working together  Aristotle or some dead Greek guy  guys I m not doing well in philosophy help me  wrote that we need Courage  Wisdom  and Peace  And that s       and    Sxso  yeah  yeah  I get it  he s not a social    so we should change him  So here you go  a boy who wants to be as close as he can to a specific person  Bakubro  we all see you  for his own safety   Ashlie Woods writes   The countertype of the Type Six subtypes  the Sexual Six is the most counterphobic Six  the one who turns against the passion of fear by assuming a stance of strength and intimidation  Instead of actively feeling fearful  these Sixes have an inner belief that when you are afraid  the best defense is a good offense   Who does that sound like      I m not citing the website correctly  but here you go  Woods  Ashlie  Retrieved  October   ,esfp
theres nooo way kirishima is an so  n i actually think hes a social       so first lets compare so  to kirishima   For the social E   the experience of not fitting in  of feeling different  of believing that they do not have what it takes to be part of a group or a community  leads them to overcompensate  to express a kind of generosity by showing themselves very aware of others and the group  He is a very gifted character in satisfying the needs of others  And it becomes a good leader  The best type of leader  in the sense of being a good person  generous and sacrificed to any type of responsibility that others want to give him      Eijiro also has concerns about not having a good enough Quirk for hero work  worried that his skills could not compare to other hero prospects  A lot of this self doubt seems to have come from an incident in Junior High when Eijiro saw Mina Ashido stop an underclassman from being bullied and save some students from a threatening figure     Eijiro is very honest and kind hearted  having a straightforward way of thinking and following a specific code of chivalry that motivates him to live without regret    how is so  NOT him   compared to the so       Social E  is cold  very formal    In efficiency  the social E  is similar to an E   Ichazo used the word duty  it is more than just being concerned with duty  since the social six are concerned above all with the reference point  They have the mind of a legislator  the categories clear  Their intellectual orientation is to know very well where the north is  where the south is  and the west  and the east  and     And if you ever wanted to become human  you would first need to go crazy and forget about all the points of reference  They need to forget duty   no duty   and connect with instinct and intuition  with life  ,esfp
Revisiting this profile almost a year later and I still don t think he s an ESFP  I may have been off with my initial typing of EXFJ  but I was onto something with the judging dom  I felt vindicated in my argument because no one would explain dominant Se  but that has lead me to a different conclusion now  I know it s almost the exact opposite of my last vote  but I suspect ISFP   Fi is the driving force in Kirishima s life  I was mistaken to argue it was Fe just because he looks up to others who share his values  Manliness  heroicism  bringing everyone to safety  All of these can be valued buy any type  but the way Kirishima makes judgements regarding them tells me he s more likely an ISFP  judging Fi dom  than ESFP  perceiving Se dom   In his earliest appearance  according to the timeline   we see him condemning bullies and trying to bring them to justice on his own  No respect for due process or any other factor in the situation  just pure heroic instinct  It s true that he admired Mina for the ease with which she took action  she s an ESFP and has higher situational awareness and active skills than him  Dom Se   Tert Te can be pretty powerful together    An Fe user might not be so keen on running around yelling at bullies to get them to stop either  Instead of taking it in stride like Mina did  the situation was passing through his own moral filter  In an instant  he decided if it was wrong  and that he wanted to be the one to do something about it  Yet  he was paralyzed  I suppose this period in his life could be characterized as a kind of Fi Ni loop  although I know loops aren t the most widely agreed upon phenomenon  so take that with a grain of salt   Kirishima feels that if he can t live up to his own Fi values  then everything he s trying to become is a lie  The entire foundation of his identity crumbles  Kirishima s internal monologue   Fatgum is going to die because of me  Move  dammit  Don t you have anything besides your hardening you useless bastard   He s afraid of not being able to embody his own standards  His concern for others isn t about what they think of him  it s solely about their safety   livelihoods  He was totally in over his head  overwhelmed with all the evil in the world  One person can t fix all that  and Kirishima really struggles to cope with that fact  Fi doms often have emotions that are too big for their bodies they get stuck in their own heads until they engage with their extroverted functions  For Kirishima  this meant changing his image  trying to be more brave  trying to live in the moment  etc  I m sure you can see where I m going with this  It sounds like parent Se    It also makes sense that his Te would be aspirational  with Se   Ni as supportive functions  The only reason ESFP might fit better than ISFP is because I can see how the spiraling and worrying about the future might look like inferior Ni  But it could just as easily be inferior Te  inability to form or execute plans   Like shieldsaint said below me  the struggle is always in the action  not in the vision of justice    Edit  more thoughts on his enneagram  I ve decided so  fits better than so   someone else has made a good comment regarding that    is definitely not his heart fix  Of course he does want to help people  but isn t it more about carving an identity as a hero than about being loved  He s also not charming or forward in the way so  s are  All of his charm comes from his dedication to his identity  So I m gonna go with     for now  I m open to   as his core type  but it s hard to know where the Fi stops and the   fears begin  I guess it would be a question of whether he saves people because he needs peace or because he wants to live up to the image he s created for himself  Let me know your thoughts on this ,esfp
The struggle this character faces in his development arc is about deciding to act  he couldn t take the decision  even knowing it was the right one  Everything in his life is filtered by his Fi global values  He doesn t really have a problem seeing the consequences of his actions  Ni   he struggles to simply act  Te    He looks really extroverted but it s because he s way healthier than before  he started developing his decision and as he feels better with himself he can be more open and friendly with others   The demon Ti is also evident when you watch the flashbacks from his past  judging himself for not being able to make the logical decision he had to make  because he knew it was the right one  bc of his Fi   he knew what to do  Se  and knew what would happen if he didn t  Ni   but yet couldn t act  and that s a Ti judgment  But as he matures he doesn t judge himself anymore and just does what he wants to do  the right thing   Over all an amazing character  I love him  I highly doubt I can change the votes here but I can try  Thank you for reading and have a nice day night   D,esfp
can someone explain to me why SEE  im still learning ab socionics  thx ,esfp
honestly  jumping on the bandwagon  were arent identical enneagram wise but i relate to her more than like any other character ever ,esfp
She s such an sx   she comes off as an sx  but her looking for her father because she thought she might feel better with him is very sx   and her needing to find someone to feel safe with and direct her on the way  James  is also very sx  ,esfp
why      isnt her character based around  I dont trust people who fit in   from the beginning of the show  she let us know that she values a lot originality  but idk tho,esfp
I m curious as to how she s a superego type  She has no sense of etiquette  compliance  etc  She doesn t really stick to a system  school of thought  mentor  etc  She s entirely independent and has little regard for her attachments  except James   I don t see how she has a sense of  proper  behaviour    Her Fe is terrible  though  Fi type makes sense ,esfp
definitely a se ni dynamic  alyssa is quick on her feet  fleeing the restaurant since they don t have enough money  and she s skilled at taking opportunities  especially in season one alyssa is seen to use unhealthy se which soon develops  she s was first considered as rash and inconsiderate about the consequences of her actions  ni inf is seen as she chooses to run away with james because she is bored with her town and crashes the car in the process ,esfp

Has anyone here considered that she might be a social introvert  RLUEN   Alyssa doesn t really go out of her way to make connections with people unless there s a reason  trying to look for  An answer  in James  Trying to make James Jealous by having s x with a stranger  and getting married to someone she doesn t love to quench the emptiness within her after the time skip   If she doesn t trust someone she will distance herself and keep communication to a minimum  the car ride with the veteran who she turned out to be wary of rightfully   Alyssa also doesn t actively seek attention be it positive or negative  She made a big scene when she smashed her phone and grabbed the entire cafeteria s attention  but that wasn t necessarily what she wanted to do  She was acting on impulse and was genuinely upset  Edit  RLUEI is plausible too ,esfp
going to argue inquisitive   non curious for his big five  ty   mystxartx  for the idea     just because he s a sensor and is described as  simpleminded  by his peers doesn t mean he can t be inquisitive  plus  the measure isn t even about someone s iq but rather about someone s openness to new experiences and information   that being said  he doesn t shy away from new experiences or seek simplicity in volleyball  he literally says that to akaashi in ch       think about what s fun  not what s easy   he isn t down to earth in the sense that he wants things to be straightforward  instead  he wants to take on challenges in volleyball  which played a huge role in his passion for the sport  when his cross shots become predictable  he is shown to be enthusiastic to learn and utilize the straight shot  which appeared in the match with nekoma in the spring high preliminary arc  he is so engrossed in volleyball and devotes so much time to constantly improving for the sake of having fun that i believe it can t be ignored when considering whether he is inquisitive or non curious  one could say that he s non curious because he sees things as they are  but i think he utilizes that keen perception of his to take on new obstacles that don t really show to deter him  if he is non curious  why wouldn t he be satisfied with his current abilities  why would he yearn to expose himself with new skills or refine the ones he knows  in my opinion  he scores high on openness  but if anyone has arguments for non curious  please let me know  ,esfp
can someone explain why the consensus is noncurious ,esfp
I m not very good at arguing for socionics but I do believe Bokuto is ESE and not SEE    First  I think we can look at Bokuto s outward image  He s described as a  child like  personality  but I think the most highlighted characteristic in him are his intense mood swings   where even the slightest thing can change his mood and impact his performance   as described in the Haiky    Wiki   I think because of this it would make sense to say that Bokuto s first contact with the environment is through the emotional atmosphere and how impactful it is  which in turn makes sense to say his base function would be Fe      Perceives information about processes taking place in objects   first of all  emotional processes that are taking place in people  their excitation or subduedness  and their moods  This perceptual element implies the ability to know what excites people  and what suppresses them  It defines a person s ability or inability to control his emotional state  and also the emotional states of other people  When this element is in the leading position  the individual has the innate ability to induce or convey his moods to others and energize people with his emotions  He is able to activate the psychological spiritual lives of other people and their emotional readiness for action  You might say that such a person has the ability to infect others with his moods and tends to impose on others the emotional states that he considers beneficial for their life activities      The individual is always in tune to the emotional flow surrounding him  and responds to it spontaneously and directly  He seeks out and creates activities where people are totally engaged in what they are doing  Something s value is directly tied to how much it arouses his or another s passion   I think this is very prominent when we see how much Bokuto loves attention and calls for attention and excitement when playing volleyball  Everyone talks about the episode where he gets sad because there s not enough people cheering for him as an argument for   core  but I think it fits a lot better as an argument for his Fe base and his need to feel connected with an exciting emotional atmosphere   For Si I d say it s very connected with a part of why he likes volleyball  which I mentioned in my previous comment when discussing his enneagram  It s all about the feeling  hitting the ball  the excitement  I think in general Bokuto is more in tune with the sensorial atmosphere      In contrast to extroverted sensing Se  Si is related to following one s own needs instead of focusing on some externally driven conception of what is necessary to acquire or achieve      Types that value Si prefer to spend their time doing enjoyable activities rather than straining themselves to achieve goals  They like to believe that if activities are done with enjoyment  people will give them more effort and time  and also becoming more skilled at what they are doing in the long run  They believe that goals should suit people s intrinsic needs rather than shaped by the demands and constraints of the external world  and so do not try to force others into doing things they don t want to do  They also try to be easygoing and pleasant  preferring peaceful coexistence to conflict  except when their personal well being or comfort is directly at stake   Compared to types that value Se  like Hinata and Oikawa  Bokuto doesn t seem like the type to strain himself  he does it out of pure enjoyment  while Hinata and Oikawa are always pushing forward to be better and do better to strive towards a goal  Bokuto is moved by the fun  the excitement  the feeling and not really an specific goal  while for Oikawa and Hinata there s always different steps and moves and they are always on a to do list  always moving a step close towards something ,esfp
This show is full of ESFPs and i love it,esfp
I think sx  might be a better fit for Bokuto than so    Looking into the seven s subtypes  I see one huge contradiction between him and this typing and that s the expression of the seven s gluttony in the social subtype    This countertype acts against the gluttony that characterises the Seven  tending to mistype with Enneagram    They are generous and have a strong desire to be of service  to create a better world  They will sacrifice their own needs to serve the needs of a group or person they support  They can be judgemental regarding selfishness in themselves or others and they hope to be appreciated for their sacrifice    This doesn t mean that social sevens are free from gluttony  they are described to have a hidden gluttony for the admiration that they want to achieve through their sacrifices      Now that we have the social seven s description  let s compare it with Bokuto   Bokuto takes on a mentor role for Hinata and Tsukishima which kinda fits the supportive quality  he is generous for teaching a rival  A huge part of his arc is about becoming reliable and the joy he brings others  Also  he certainly loves the admiration he gets from Hinata and the audience at matches     Other than that though we are faced with a blatant issue  This boy is freaking selfish and he is far from being ashamed about it   From small things like stealing all the meat at the BBQ for himself  in Chestnut s description of the so  it is mentioned that they would rather take the smallest piece of cake even if they would want the biggest one which makes this kinda funny imo lol  or his short  WTF dude      reactions when he wants a set but doesn t get one to bigger stuff like him nagging Tsuki to join them practice  him being disappointed for not being in the spotlight of the bigger arena  him being always ready to compliment himself and  passively  bringing all of Fukur dani to accommodate to his personal needs  And it s not like he isn t aware of this stuff  he knows what he is doing and how it affects others    Bokuto s motivation for volleyball re ignited when he found a way to effectively defeat his opponents  He trains so much because it s fun for him  He wants to be the Ace because it s fun for him and it gives him more of that feeling he gets from successful spikes  He is extremely extra  he wants to be the center of attention  His quote  It s not impossible  it s just hard  shows that he wants to keep going through challenges  His approach to volleyball quite literally fits the definition of gluttony  He isn t ashamed of it and definitely does not act against it  His volleyball approach also brings me to another argument why the sexual subtype fits him better    It s not just that the sx  s expression of their gluttony  look at Hinata for reference  aligns with Bokuto  but also his idealization of the role of the Ace makes sense for this subtype   The dreamer  the idealist  the romantic   the SX Seven sees reality through a rose coloured filter  connected to the possibility in everything  Their enthusiasm and optimism may seem unrealistic or naive as they tend to believe in the good in everything and everyone    Being the ace is something multiple characters in Haikyuu take really seriously  but Bokuto takes it to the extreme  Rather than taking the   as it would be normal for a captain  he took the   as his jersey number because it s usually the number of the ace  It feels like he sees the possibilities of the volleyball he wants to play in the ace position  Then there is the  The way of the ace  shirt he and Hinata like so much which describes the perfect Ace he aspires to be  Noticeable is the first point   Your back should be an inspiration to your teammates   It shows another  again more selfish  part of his character arc  A good ace is an inspiration for his team  therefore he wants to be an inspiration for his team   Don t get me wrong  he is a really good hearted person that deeply cares about his friends  He wants to do his best for Fukur dani so that they can do their best with him  It s just important to note that no pure self sacrifice is involved in it   His attachment to the team that treated him so well might also be seen as an indication of the  romantic  aspect  but I m worried that this could come off as reaching from my part    Though his relationship with his team is important nevertheless  The sx  defense mechanisms are described to be suggestion  fantasy and illusion  His team gets him out of Emo mode through stroking his Ego by complimenting his skills or implying that all eyes are on him  Those compliments are of course grounded in reality to some extent  but this guy again takes it  again  to the extreme as seen by his quote  The whole world is on my side        ,esfp

Thoughts on Bokuto being  w    The reason I doubt type   is his response to anxiety fear    which he feels a lot  Whenever he underperforms or is feeling like he isn t  good enough  he immediately voices it to his teammates  He wants approval  attention  and a reminder that he is still good at the sport  I also think he can be quite suspicious of others  often doubting if they truly value him appreciate the work he puts into the sport  He definitely tries to play off this fear and tries to focus on what  feels nice  but that doesn t mean he is automatically type    being a social   explains this Type   wants to run away from bad emotions  to very quickly summarise  or immerse themselves into something that feels better  Perhaps I m not remembering each and every scene but I really do not see this with Bokuto  Like I said  when he feels anxiety doubt in his ability he voices his fears in the hopes of everyone acknowledging them so it doesn t feel as bad when someone points it out   which is how a type   would react  I m not seeing the stereotypical type   response which would be to run away from those feelings  in fiction anyway   Perhaps comparing him to a  w  ESFP would also help  if you look at Nishinoya then the differences will be more evident   Here is the description for so sx type    sums up Bokuto perfectly      This type can be very different from the other social type  because with this type  security comes from making alliances with individuals  Their weakness comes from their self pres instinct being last  so they are not as independent as the self pres soc  They rely on key people in their lives when doubt sets in  Their security comes from maintaining close bonds  They fear rejection much more then the soc self pres  This softens the strong stances seen in the soc self pres  because the soc sex doesn t find its security in organizations and government  They go through life looking for the people they think will be able to direct them  On the down side  they can make individuals into their authority figures and rely too much on them  They are a lighter Six  They go with the flow more than the other subtypes  They are likely to use humor to charm people  but on the down side may whine and complain about their circumstances to garner support  When healthier  their charm  enthusiasm and curiosity are infectious  They are very loyal friends  although that can be said more or less about all reasonably healthy Sixes  But with the self pres soc and the soc sex nothing much more then your support is required  for maintaining their friendship       Also  why does he have a   fix over    Does Bokuto really put on an image which he wants others to appreciate instead of being  himself   He wants to be loved and admired by others  so he does this by appearing accomdating   hence why he became Hinata s mentor for example  Which is type   over     Very willing to listen to type   arguements or answer any questions  leave them below ,esfp
wtf why social   and not sexual   ,esfp
I think his Ne is what drives the character the most  He s basically a child that watched too many movies and gets the dream of becoming a protagonist in his own space opera movie  He creates a name for himself and wants to be recognized as a Space bad boy  His team mates doesn t really respect him as a leader  lack of Te  but they follow him for his ideas and plans  He often references things from his childhood for jokes or just in general  Ne Si  example  He named his ship Milano after a childhood crush and Gamora doesn t know what Cheers is scene   When Iron Man explains a plan to face Thanos  he s already figuring out how to make a better one lmao  His Inf Si is one of the most obvious things in history of obviouses  The conflicts in the   GotG films always had something to do with his past  He listens to music his mother gave him as it is a source of comfort  Most of his issues stem from not being able to let go  An Inf Ni would have more problem with seeing their future or potential  compare to Thor who s conflicted about being King  ,esfp
Okay  this is my first time doing this and it is okay if you guys agree that he is an ESFP  But from where I am standing  he could also be an ENTP  Let me explain  this is also my first learning about the functions so if I make mistake  please correct me     Ne  If there was a definition for this function  it would be that he wants to explore and live a life unlike anyone else  the first scene as an adult is him living as a bounty hunter even if he is not good at it   Sees possibilities in the external world   I gonna make some weird       a quote in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol    as he finds out that he is a celestial and can create anything   He is usually witty and sometimes explorative and in Infinity War  he changed Tony s plan into a  What could be   He mostly uses his Ne to act positive and think up new ideas  in the beginning of Infinity War  he tries to be at the middle and thinks of a way to make both parties happy  Units   Money or Heroic Morality   he even does this in the movie three times with the objective of the orb  He gave himself an outlaw name  calling himself  Star Lord  and named his ship the Milano which goes over our second function   Ti  This one is pretty funny in my opinion  when the group were asking if he had a plan  he said      meaning that there was a plan he had in mind  it probably meant that it would be very risky  The plan in the first movie was a good example of what his Ne  his Ti and later on his Fe can do together  He does a plan if it makes sense  if he is in a rush  he will do it  making his skeptism seen as a  W   He also has a hard explaning his plan to his other friends  except Groot who is trying to be nice  because most of them have either Se or Si  which isn t a bad thing  it mostly means that he has to speak in a way they can understand  This can be seen when Peter is communicating with Drax for the first time or when he speaks to Gamora sometimes  But it also shows him his social side as a seven  sacrificing his greed to help the others around him to have a good time    most of the time   Fe  This is a good trait for him as a leader  his compassion for others  His big speech to his friends perfectly describes what the Fe is  using their internal and cultural values in order to seek peace and harmony onto others  and possibly themselves  It s even his arc in the first film  to stop running away from commitment and pain and look inward into yourself and others and becoming more  a guardian   Si  This would be his weakness  He keeps arguing of how his life wasn t the best as a kid in thee fact that he never had a father  so he chooses to move on and stay on the right path  in a sense  moving on from the pain  But it also manifests in the fact that he ran away when his mom was dying  leaving Yondu most of the time to do his own thing  He trusts the past  because the past has done nothing than hurt him  What is the point of going into the past  when the past hurts you and wants nothing to do with you    Please  if there is anyone that disgrees with me and believes they re a different type  I will respect your opinion and wish to figure out why just for the fun of it  anyways have a good day ,esfp

I m confused about Quill  although I have definitely encountered his type IRL  Very visibly different from Thor  who s a true ESFP  Is it the difference in upbringing  Quill is like an ESFP with a bit compromised Fi  or some sort of ENTP or ESTP twisted by life into a non standard shape ,esfp

There is just no real evidence for him being much of an Ne user  let alone an Ne dom  Star Lord is deeply pragmatic  astute  fact minded and realistic in the way that he perceives the world  which makes him highly focused on his external reality more on a physical level  than a conceptual one  We see a lot of his Se Te pragmatism with his opportunistic nature focusing on everything around him  as it exists rather than how it could be   and how he it could serve to his benefit  or his detriment  He doesn t focus on expanding on ideas or possibilities just for the sake of hypothetical exploration or curiosity  but instead he has a direct and precise focus on what directly applies to the situation at hand  An ENXP character would be focused on bounding from one idea to the next  finding synergy between distant concepts  An Se user would have a concrete  verifiable and realistic thought process based on the reference frame of their observable reality  as opposed to the conceptual expansion of ideas  He prioritizes the physical nature of reality and how he can influence to his advantage  over a focus on the intangible nature of the world and what it could entail  Furthermore  he s more kinaesthetic by nature than one who relies on intangible sensibilities  with how receptive he is to physical stimuli  as opposed to conceptual triggers   TL DR Star Lord is mainly oriented by his  concrete  universe and his reactivity towards physical stimuli  rather than showing a high priority for the the expansion of concepts and the divergence of ideas and thought patterns  He has a strong presence of mind in every situation and an astute focus in tangible information  and a keen awareness of his surroundings  He focuses on  what is   rather than  what could be   Also  him being  creative  doesn t make him an intuitive  creativity is not an exclusively intuitive trait ,esfp

I dont see his Se at all  He is obvious Ne dom for me  His abstract way of thinking  seeing many possibilities  when he wanted to kill Dostoyevsky  but changed his mind   following the innovative idea of freedom like a bird   that s all Ne traits  Then  he can create creative plans  like  game  for Dazai and Fyodor where they get poisoned and try to escape the prioson  and he is very creative in general  Can someone explain his Se   Im very curious about this ,esfp

I think Gogol might be an ENFP  Fi Te is obviously there  and I can see why people think he s Se  But then he d have Inf Ni  and he doesn t  His bad conclusions are pretty much blind spot Te going nuts  While Inf Si is definitely there  imo  He is trying to go as far away as he can from the  normal  course of action  which sounds like he s afraid of getting stuck in the mundane and the tried and true  which sounds like someone suppressing tertiary inferior Si ,esfp
guys please  his Se dom is so obvious  stop voting every witty quirky fun character as ENTP  if you wonder why he s Se dom go to top comments and read the arguments  edit  idk who changed his pfp but thank you HE S SO PRETTY ON THIS NEW PIC AJJAJAJA,esfp

When is Star fighting against gluttony  She is rebellious and opportunistic  not really worried about being a good girl to be a Social Seven  She is a Sexual Seven  the dreamy kind  enthusiastic and optimistic     I can t make another comment without making this one longer so I just decided to edit this one     about Extraverted Sensing    Extraverted Sensation  Se  makes sense of the world by attending to what exists concretely here and now  and trusting your instincts  As an epistemological perspective  Se leads you to believe only in what you can see and experience concretely  and to trust your immediate  gut level responses to it  If it looks like a duck  walks like a duck  sounds like a duck  then it s a duck  Whatever a sign means is obvious and inescapable  if a sign s meaning is not obvious  then it s meaningless  Whatever is physical  immediate  gut level cannot be faked and must be right  For example  if you sense that someone is up to no good  then you trust that sense  If you have an impulse to paint the town red  then you go out and do so  As an ethical perspective  Se leads you to believe that life is to be lived right now   in the moment   responding to things immediately and without thought  What matters most in life is what makes the biggest perceivable impact  whatever stands out in a way that can t be ignored  Se leads you to develop a persona that is attractive and  hip  according to the conventions of your society and your time  to go with the flow without stopping to question the direction  If something isn t fun  then don t do it    That is just like Star  in every single way  you can t tell me she is not a Se dom ,esfp

I think this generation consists of people who are very community minded and interdependent on each other  That being said  i do believe mostly the teens of this generation are constantly inspecting the past  Si  and using it to make judgements about people and relationships  Fe   These judgements are based off of collective morals  Fe  and how they compare to past mistakes or occurrences  Si   I think this fits cancel culture  cliques  the resurgence of   s and early     s trends  and the political opinions of today s youth  Not to mention the overall emotional expression and intense emotionality that incorporates others in some way  shape  or form    Sx   in my opinion also represents this generation  which has a very  You need to be perfect  according to moral standards and social principles  and sx   has a closer connection to   which would explain the higher need for individuality and present reactivity  Fear of being defective and corrupt is combatted with a  so what if i m defective and corrupt  attitude that is just a cover up for the fear of being defective and corrupt      tritype is self explanatory  ESFP is simply stereotyping many people in this generation due to their social and hedonistic nature    I speak of this generation separately not to specifically separate myself from this generation  but to keep my typing impartial by viewing this generation as a  separate object  ,esfp
can t decide ESFP or ESFJ  in some ways Fi Te seems obvious  but in other ways  Fe Ti seems obvious  i ve seen a lot of issues with people on tiktok being like  i literally can t form my own opinion until i go into the comments  which lowkey gives unhealthy Fe   maybe    lots of people don t actually seem to care that much about many others and just want to appear like a savior  idk ,esfp
I am curious  Why would ESFP be the most common  You guys claim that this generation is most individualistic  but that can be said about every generation  To me  I see more collectivity and people absorbing familiar values  advocating for minorities and social justice  which is xSFJ than ESFP   Not to get stereotypical or reductionist  but Fi users can be highly selfish as a result of not being able to relate to other people s emotional experience as they do their own and their own morals  If you ask me  minorities fighting on behalf of their identity  lgbtq  rights  religion  race  etc   are more Fi  And they are  well  a minority   Simply seeing people around you with dyed hair  eccentric clothing  etc  does not make them XSFP  If anything  the opposite  If a bunch of people gather together to purposely embody the same niche styles  they are no longer niche and then mainstream  All teenagers are discovering themselves  Plenty are prone to engage in reckless behaviour  This is a component of puberty and insufficient brain development rather than actual cognitive process ,esfp
morons  there just morons,esfp
lots of Ne from my own observations  ,esfp
Is this page a joke  Fe is the expressive emotive function  Fi literally has been described by Jung as cold  The whole idea of Fi is that the feeling is introverted  aka deeper inside of the person  more on the subconscious level  and personal to the user  while Fe is more visible on the surface  willing to connect to others in a communal way  and generally less personal  Also balanced Si Ne makes a lot of sense for gen z bc they are known for their throwback posts and focus on nostalgia   what they found to be personally significant in their own lives  alongside a constant focus on new clever ideas and possibilities  always trying to take the perspectives of others  especially when involving topics of social justice  Ti inferior is also clear  as we view the average Gen Z person as a follower of trends or ideas  not often thinking for themselves  as well as avoiding impersonal logical analysis in favor of focusing on everyones values  No hate  since I m gen Z too and a strong Si user  but we as a generation are clearly ESFJ ,esfp
i feel like there s a bunch of INTP and ESFP gen z kids,esfp
With the existence of Tiktok  we can weed out every single ESxP in existence,esfp
I know that nobody is talking about it  but WOW      Gon is winning on  F on Attitudinal Psyque       The  F attitude is formed by placing the physics aspect  F  into the insecure position   rd   Insecure physics   F  has an apprehensive and unsure attitude towards all concepts of the physical world  All  F types believe they are insufficient at being involved in matters relating to the material world  They are mostly anxious about their opinions on tastes  belongings  comforts  aesthetics  value  worth  sensations and practical skills  These types tend to have a shaky and unstable relationship with how they process all things related to the physical reality  They tend to need clarification and feedback from others when engaging in all matters related to physics    ,esfp

Gon being a Head Type over Gut Type   Non Curious   PDB will type any seemingly happy go lucky shounen character as Type   and Non Curious   Gon does have   traits but he fits into Type   much more  His primary fear always seemed to be of weakness   I never imagined being weak would be so painful   and that was like the first time we ve seen him in such a state  He goes to extreme levels to assert strength  even at the cost of self preservation  He s motivated by a desire to protect his loved ones  this was especially seen in Chimera Ant arc  He has no sense of right and wrong  and just acts on his feelings  his motive being the desire to attain greater power and to protect avenge himself and others   And how is he Non Curious   He s always willing to learn about things  even things of no value  Sure he s kinda dumb  but whenever he s met with new information  he always tries to learn more about it  Zepile s monologue   I get why this kid  Gon  interests me  He doesn t care about right or wrong  His reaction was just innocent curiosity  he opens his mind to everything that interests him   When Killua tells Gon that his parents were assassins  Gon s first reaction was to ask him  Huh  Both of them   taking Killua by surprise at how unfazed he was  Even with Meleoron  a possible threat  Gon still decided to  trust  him enough to talk to him  just because he wanted to know why he was following him  Meleoron himself comments on how clueless Gon was for his innocent curiosity   Just because he can t do math doesn t mean he isn t Inquisitive and just because seems like an innocent kid doesn t mean he can t be an    Keyword   seems   Gonna get a little off topic here  Gon has to be one of the best shounen protagonists  It s kinda annoying how his character gets waterned down to the  innocent sweet kid  archetype cause he s none of that  never was  Just like most HxH characters  Gon is very layered  Most characters that meet him just go  This kid is a monster  and Wing even regrets  kinda  teaching Gon Nen  all rightfully  Because they could tell just how power hungry and dangerous he is beneath the outward layer of innocence  not to imply it s insincere   The only way anyone can conclude Gon to be Type   and Non Curious is if they didn t pay attention to any of his scenes  Even his Wiki description points most toward Type   and Inquisitive ,esfp

man got helped to pass the hunter exam so he first rejected the offer  and after he was forcefully given it he got sad and cried  went off to help people so he didn t feel weak and useless  then vowed to get revenge on the one who helped him and didn t use his license before he got revenge  if that isn t the most   thing ever idk what is    s don t like to show weakness and vulnerabilities all that much  and will occasionally help others to feel of use  Gon felt humiliated af after he got help  even if it was in private   also    is a mind triad type    is gut type and this itself prooves that gon isnt a    hj  him being a   feels very stereotyped  just because he is a kid and an mc doesn t mean he cant be      context  badge stealing island,esfp

Ok let s start debunking the E  typing because no  I won t let the   voters be happy  i recommend reading my first argument too     starting with triad theory  THE THINKING TRIAD The dominant feelings in types Five  Six  and Seven are anxiety and insecurity   Fives  Sixes  and Sevens cannot get their minds to simmer down  This is a problem because the quiet mind allows us to feel profoundly supported  inner knowing and guidance arise in the quiet mind and give us confidence to act in the world  When these qualities are blocked  we feel fear  Their reactions to fear distinguish the three types of the Thinking Triad   Gon does not show issues with anxiety   fear  he does not jump to anticipations and planning to   cope   with this supposed fear  ignoring the fact that he simply does not fit the thinking triad  E  and se dom   base is incredibly contradictory   E   grounded  E    seek sensory stimulation   E   sensors  However  Killua is a GREAT example of how a thinking triad type looks  SX   he does show issues with insecurity and fear  he feels anxious inside so he jumps into external action and anticipation of the future like  s  thing Gon NEVER did   Now let s go over E s trait structure   Gluttony  open minded  exploratory  insatiable  frustration hidden behind enthusiasm  glutton for the extraordinary esoteric  anti conventional   Hedonistic permissiveness  self indulgent  laissez fairy attitude towards others  entitlement to gratification   Rebelliousness  humorous outlet  intellectual rebellion  anti conventional attitude   behavioral acquiescence  diplomatic rather than oppositional to authority  equalitarian  Lack of discipline  unstable  non committal  perceives pleasure postponement as lovelessness   Imaginary wish fulfillment  focus on fantasy plans utopia future potential  disconnected from down to earth reality in favor of imagined plans and ideals   Seductively pleasing  want to fulfill those they want to seduce through helpfulness problem free generosity  good hosts spenders hidden exploitation parasitic tendencies  entertaining  repression of pain and refuge in pleasure   Narcissism  exhibitionist    know better    well informed    intellectually superior    compulsion to explain  pretended superiority masked by   brotherly   bonds  hidden inferiority insecurity  manipulatively charming  hypnotic enchantment  good intuition   Persuasive  often high intelligence  high verbal ability  skillfully explain and rationalize  belief in their own wisdom and respectability   Fraudulence  confused between imagination and reality  have a persona hiding anxiety  have a smoothness hiding aggression  have a generosity hiding exploitativeness  metaphorical   charlatans          people confuse gluttony with lust  Gon shows lust not gluttony  hedonistic permissiveness aspect isn t      fitting  he fits  s rebelliousness way better than  s rebelliousness  for lack of discipline he s a literal child and he has a   fix  imaginary wish fulfillment is a complete contradiction of his character specially being ESFP  seductively pleasing isn t accurate  narcissism  persuasiveness and fraudulence are NOT present   He also does not fit  s defense mechanism  as I already mentioned he s denial as a person   The SEVENS  Primary Defense Mechanism | Rationalization Rationalization is the defense mechanism by which Sevens explain unacceptable thoughts  feelings  and behaviors in a way that entirely avoids or obscures their true motivations  intentions  or the effects of the behavior  They also use rationalization to ease the pain and discomfort of others  When Sevens rationalize  they use positive reframing  justifying their behavior by explaining it in highly positive terms as a way to avoid difficulties sadness  guilt  and anxiety  as well as to avoid taking personal responsibility for what has occurred  In fact  they reframe so frequently  they do not perceive it as a rationalization  Instead  they perceive this as the way they always think ,esfp

Sp   This  cute  Two expresses pride and a need for protection through youthful ways of gaining attention and affection  The unconscious strategy the Self Preservation Two employs is to  seduce  like a child in the presence of grown ups Grown up here is Light  who is the mature amd parent like figure in the sp   s relationship   This represents both an unconscious need to be taken care of and a sense that children are naturally loveable  inherently deserving of affection  and usually more readily liked than adults  This Two has a childlike quality in presentation and emotional expression no matter how old they are  this Two looks youthful or young    Comparison  While the Sexual Two can seem overly adult  wild  and seductive in the usual sense of the term  the Self Preservation Two unconsciously aims to attract love and attention through being cute and expressing a childlike sense of need  I think it s clear Misa is a sp    Sp  s also desire love and use seduction but to more mature people who are like grown ups in the relationship Light  not just grown ups as in parent lol,esfp
EDIT  I am no longer confident in this argument  so feel free to ignore it  In the comments  someone made a good case for SP     I agree that SP is in her instinctual variant  but  in general  I think she is an SX    Her core desire manifests the most in the sexual sphere of her life  not the self preserving one  She seeks love in the form of romance  not from parental figures  In addition  she is assertive and extroverted  and she uses her sex appeal to her advantage  This correlates with her Jungian archetype  the Lover  Finally  SP  s believe they are entitled to love simply for being who they are  but she anchors her deservingness of love in her acts of service to the individual she wants love from ,esfp

To the people who thinks he is an ENFP  tell me where the heck is his inferior Si and dominant Ne without including his dream to becoming a volleyball player    Also isn t Hinata known to be very  in the moment  and  sensual  while playing volleyball and just in general  I m sorry but I don t see any reason why he would be an ENFP other than stereotypes nm  As an ESFP  I can see myself in him  not a reason why I think he s an ESFP  and seeing how other ENFPs are in real life  friends   I can t see a reason at all to why he d have Ne instead of Se ,esfp
i can see why people vote for him as ENFP  but personally i think he s ESFP ,esfp
Personally  i see him as an ENFP  He tends to act with a lot more ne than se  He is a lot more inquisitive and nomadic than you see se doms acting  As a ne dom I find this pretty relatable but I can also see arguments for ESFPs ,esfp
Hinata uses his intuition and not his feelings as he appeared in the fourth season and some clips in the early seasons he is not very good at understanding the feelings of others such as Noya F Noya ESFP and Hinata ENFP,esfp
Why a     tho  Just doesn t make much sense to me   ,esfp
this is a tough one  i can see the arguments for ENFP  But I think he s ESFP fr  He s much more in touch with physical reality and what is currently happening around him  Also  he simply trusted Kageyama in the beginning  and it took him a while to want to change the fact that he was closing his eyes and spiking when Kageyama sets to him  Not to mention  people with intuition characteristics usually would rather think through things than have hands on experience  I just don t think that applies for Hina  As much as I would love him in the ENFP gang I definitely think he s ESFP instead lol,esfp

I have made the last vote necessary for it to change to ESFP  when I started in typology I firmly believed that he was an ENTP but now I realize that I only believed that because of stereotypes and not because of functions  ,esfp
guys literally it is ENTP he uses others except a few people  he is an intuitive person and usually puts himself first than with others,esfp
I decides relook self opinion   before I think   that he ENTP   but he more se user   And i don t agree   that he ESFP    Well   in order    Se  it is cravings to amusements   It is comparatively clearly   Ti   it is morality   Lucifer doesn t lie in the trial   But he doesn t tell anything Chloe   but she doesn t ask tell her  The more important Lucifer s secret in divineness    He conceals something   but it is white lie    Fe   we should remember   Lucifer was upset   when Chloe was upset   It isn t ego   Chloe is the most important person for Lucifer    Ni   no signs  ,esfp
he s se dom stereotype i dont know how ENTP voters cant see that anyway really where is ti  even his brother amenadiel ti tert  has more ti than him,esfp
I can t believe some Ne doms can t differentiate a fellow from a sensor haha  Lucifer is such an ESFP  Maybe his critical Fe makes people think he is a Fe user  But I seriously don t understand where do people see Ti  His way of thinking is literally just  how is this gonna effect me  and once he scrxws up because he can t put   and   together and acts reckless  he starts rethinking his actions and that s where his critical Fe appears clearly  Very much Se Fi ,esfp
O Lucifer   manipolador e tem sempre um plano por isso nunca seria um ESTP mas sim ENTP ,esfp

Y all  OH MY GOD HE S SUCH AN ENTP WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT     Then provide evidence for Ne  provide evidence for Ti  provide evidence for Fe  and provide evidence for inferior Si  Provide a detailed analysis instead of claiming something because of  vibes  that s not going to convince anyone and you people are making a joke out of properly typing someone  You people hate it when others falsely claim to be a personality type calling them uneducated on functions but then encourage inaccurate typing like this because he just  seems  like an ENTP  What   Maybe if you stopped viewing Se  Fi  and Te as such negative functions you d be able to accept his actual typing  Se is keen and observant which Lucifer is  Fi is highly devoted to one s conviction and emotions and isn t easily swayed  which Lucifer is  Te is resourceful and empirical  which Lucifer is  All these traits are so admirable but you people are still pushing the agenda he s Ne and Ti because he s all over the place and funny  Unless you can back up your voting don t make such arbitrary claims ,esfp
Here s an Ne dom idea  Why don t you ding dongs get over yourselves and actually read the top comments explaining Lucifer s function usage instead of coming on this profile and commenting a bunch of useless rubbish about how he s ENTP because you said so  Oh and the reason is what   lmaoo he s the most ENTP character I ve ever seen   This profile is not your playground  if you re at least not going to argue in a meaningful way  go to the community board to relieve yourselves of your personal thoughts    I haven t left an argument on this page yet  so here we go   Let me clear the misconception  as many before me have done  that having a witty sense of humor is not and should not be your main takeaway from this character to determine his type  Many people fail to see the creativity of Se as a function and think of it solely as hedonism  Which is funny because even in that case  Lucifer is the literal definition of hedonism  If you want to know if someone uses Ne or Se  look at their motivations    Both Ne and Se users are capable of having a witty sense of humor  the difference between them is that  the connections and metaphors Se utilizes tend to emphasize a singular perspective  Ni  and is rarely multi faceted  On the contrary  Ne users can go on blabbing about a perspective or connection they just thought of  entertaining themselves with the mere fact that their chain of thought is endless and ever evolving  Compare Lucifer to Ella  and actual ENTP  How many times have you seen Ella launch off into a monologue about whatever crazy idea she just thought of  or what a particular piece of evidence reminds her of  or simply turning a crime scene into a theatrical performance because that is what her Ne wanted to experiment with at that instant  Lucifer is the opposite  He doesn t have an ever evolving line of thinking  he is rather straightforward and has a  let s get this over with  attitude  If he has an impulse  he acts on it  If he wants to unexpectedly run off to Las Vegas for two weeks without notice and get married to a complete stranger  so be it   Ne leads you to practice  out of the box  thinking  There are never any final answers  just more and more opportunities to shift concepts and make sense of things in new ways  Whatever we think things mean today  we ll probably find out tomorrow they mean something different   Since when is Lucifer one to mull over concepts and ideas SIMPLY for the sake of exploration  Since when does he view the world as a web of mysteries to unravel and make sense of  Lucifer s main focus is obtaining results and immediate satisfaction from his sensory environment  Se means having a gut level response to concrete events and trusting that impulse    Much like what Lucifer does    ALL THE TIME   As for his Fi Te axis  having poor self awareness is not an indication of having poor Fi  Every action Lucifer takes  his entire motivation to change himself  all stem from his strong sense of identity of being  the Devil   Everything in his life has been affected by this  his reason for ending his relationship with Eve  Eve   But I want to be with you   Lucifer   And I don t like who I am with you     his whole identity crisis when Dan said that he wasn t one of the good guys  taking it as an attack on his identity and relapsing into his old Devil ways in order to get a grip on who he was again after this accusation  him projecting his personal issues onto every case and making snap judgements about people based on his personal experience that he is currently projecting  etc  When you think about it  NONE of his decisions are guided by a personal logic  It s all fueled by a strong belief based on his emotions  This man does NOT have tertiary Fe  much less auxiliary Ti    PLEASE RECONSIDER YOUR VOTE ,esfp
Only   INTP vote  How surprising  She s totally the stereotypical INTP character with her    brain and uhh thinking skills  Yeah totally ,esfp
She is very much a Se dom  saying things like  that is a problem for future Catra and Adora  and  well  there s nothing here NOW   I really could not see her as anything other than a Se dom ,esfp
ESTP voters where is her Ti AND Fe  She clearly has Fi AND Te   Fi  one s STRONG personal judgment moral values Catra knows EXACTLY what she s doing during s  s      but according to her personal judgment moral values  what she s doing IS NOT WRONG  at least according to her Fi   And this is very strong considering it s her auxiliary function but she s most likely fell into a Se Te loop somewhere in the middle of a show   Te  Te is a decision making function that focuses on objective  logical criteria  Te users trust empirical evidence and look at cause and effect and pros and cons when they make decisions  They like to organize  evaluate  and compare using logical binary judgments  We can see that Catra fell to a Se Te loop to gain Hordak s trust and becoming loyal to him  becoming impatient with her fellow Horde soldiers and demanding results quickly  etc ,esfp
my fav toxic lesbian    but she s trying  s  ,esfp
She notices small defails around her and is very immersed in her outsied world and sense which keads me to think she is Se dom  I definitely think she is Fi auxiliary because she lashes out alot when her own beliefs or feelings are questioned ,esfp
emo cat lmao now im gonna type random      bc i have to have    letters,esfp
the amount of comments here about catra being an ESTP increasing slowly is so funny catra is NOT an ESTP  she has   FE  she works completely off how she feels about certain situations   it s  literally  what drives the entire plot for the show  she runs off how she feels about situations and lets her own emotions and feelings drive her throughout the show  like holy      look at her finding out shadow weaver betrayed her and  left her for adora   how she feels  so she acts on her own feelings  se fi  and uses the facts given around her in order to survive  yes  she does have trauma making her harder to type but ultimately trauma is something that has an impact on your personality type  like it or not ,esfp
I think she clearly disintegrates to    which is why it looks like she has a   fix  but I believe her heart fix is actually    She doesn t try to achieve things as compensation when she feels she is not liked by others  Rather  she needs them to need her  and she feels that she is responsible for them  Especially in the last season  she is crushed when she believes she is unwanted by Adora  and throws everything into being a good friend to her  Much of her motivation for disintegrating to   and leaning into her   fix comes from the fact that she feels others don t need her  She wants to be loved  and in her ideal world  she is not the achiever  she is simply Adora s best friend ,esfp
Catra is the full definition of disintegrating and growing    and Se dom Ni inf ,esfp
I don t really understand why people keep voting ESTP while she clearly has no tert Fe of an ESTP  Also feeling the same about the  w  votes  She is focused on her power and ability to fight everyone until she has what she wants   late of season   spoilers incoming  remember the time she lost her bendings and thought she ll never be an avatar powerful enough to keep the balance and win against Amon  she lost her will to live  Power is everything for her ,esfp
Bro just cuz she s rebellious and sometimes awkward doesn t mean social blind  She s way too driven for social change and justice for weaker individuals for social blind  Not saying social blinds can t  but her sx energy is way too forward without any sp pullback stability sx so     Textbook sx   without a doubt though,esfp
She is the stereotypical ESFP and I fail to see any Ti or Fe  In the way she carries herself  I generally imagine her employing Fi Te  She s always standing up for what she believes in  going against the grain and saying it like it is  She enjoys letting everyone know how she thinks about any given scenario and rarely hides her annoyances  She s really forthright about stuff like that  She s incredibly aggressive when combined with her Te ,esfp
Her Fi is much stronger and prominent than her Ti,esfp

Yk  ppl voting ESTP just because  FEELERS ARE CRYBABYS   and it s stupid Where s her Ti at all  I always though she was person who rarely analyze a situation  especially in the first season  and this led her to not the best situations  She also believed that she was generally scolded for nothing ,esfp
Even from her first scene  Korra selfishly smashes her family house with Earthbending when her mother asks her to come greet the White Lotus inspectors and nearly hurts them with her bending    I m the Avatar  You gotta deal with it    Se impulsivity and demonstrating her physical awareness in the world   Fi inner code  caring more about her feelings and validation than reading the room  Yes  she was around   when this happened  but even a young ESTP would not be so egotistical and self centered  As she gets older  her Se and Fi become full on display  When Korra moves to Republic City  she impulsively and rashly dives in to capture a criminal as a way to prove herself to everyone that the Avatar showed up  Korra enjoys pro bending and uses Se to quickly comprehend the nature of the sport  even going as far as to master theoretical applications of bending through kinesthetics  You see her constantly butting heads with Tenzin and even the new Team Avatar when they want her to guide her  Korra would rather do things her own way  Don t participate in pro bending  Don t challenge Amon to a match openly in a press conference  Don t go with Unalaq  Korra judges her allegiance primarily on how she feels at the moment  She ignores her father  who has actual reservations against Korra being with his brother knowing their history  and she decided to go with Unalaq anyway  Korra did so because she felt Tenzin did not teach her how to use waterbending and the spiritual aspects of bending properly  she was impatient since she didn t get the results she wanted right away and she moved on to someone else she felt could  I doubt a Fe user would storm into a police office and deliberately destroy the place because she found out her then boyfriend Mako had been cheating on her  She also uses Te  rather than Ti  I never once see her apply and create her own logical structure to anything she does  Korra instead goes for solutions that already work for her and are quick and easy with Te  For instance  she challenges Amon directly and openly to a duel since defeating him means the end of the Equalists  rather than analyze why it would not be in her best interest to challenge the leader of a terrorist group to a duel who is so skilled in combat and espionage that he had not been captured yet by the City s well trained Police in months  where potential supporters of his could be in the audience to feed him intel  and without analyzing Amon s fighting abilities and weapons for any weaknesses she can exploit  She doesn t create an internal system to overcome Amon in the most logical way possible   No  she sees the big bad criminal and without any awareness or knowledge  she decides that she has to prove herself as the Avatar and defeating Amon right there and then is the best way to get that   After her tragic incident  Korra becomes extremely reluctant to share her personal vulnerabilities with anyone else  she becomes secretive and withdrawn  She doesn t connect with people anymore  She lies to her family about her whereabouts  She ignores what the people around her want  which is to recover  and instead obsesses over doing everything she can to never be vulnerable again  She uses Se to do things in the current moment such as her tournament fights  Te to go to places that can allow her to easily make money and still let out her anger through the fights  and Fi to guide her to healing her psyche by forgetting everything she did since she first went to Republic City  She abandoned everything she did since that ultimately led her to Zaheer and almost dying by his hand  Because being the Avatar meant that she had to be poisoned with liquid mercury  almost dying  and having to rely on people for the first time while the world at large considered her a failure if an Avatar  Instead of recovering  she obsessively tries to build up her strength so she can never be vulnerable and lose in battle ever again  Tell me where the Fe is   She is a clear as day ESFP ,esfp
SEE seems pretty obvious   Se base   Ni suggestive  Korra s primarily personality trait is her strength  impulsivity  and conflict seeking nature  She often jumps into things without thinking or planning ahead  For example  leaving the Water Tribe to find Tenzin in Republic City  immediately getting into a fight with gang members  which gets her into trouble with Lin Beifong  LSI    joining the Mako  SLI  and Bolin s  ESE  pro bending team on the spot  going to confront Amon the first time  etc  and that s just within    episodes or so   Fi creative  Korra s relationships play a very large role in her life  She prides herself on her loyalty to friends  and in opposition to her enemies  Amon  Tarlock  EIE   Unalaq  SLE   Zaheer  IEI   Kuvira  SLE   all Beta  she primarily focuses on their moral failings  She calls them out based on her instinctive moral beliefs  This all fits Fi ego  but Korra shows herself to be quite flexible in her relations  eg  attempting to save and redeem Kuvira despite her being evil  This flexibility fits Fi creative over Fi base   Ti PoLR  Korra is completely  utterly  hopelessly lacking any sort of internally coherent worldview  Her lack of ideology is the main reason so many bad guys keep on popping up  Korra doesn t have any ideas of any institutions or ideologies to implement to solve the world s problems  In her mind  she just needs to defeat the bad guys  and once the bad guys are defeated then her job is done   Beyond lacking ideology  Korra also fails to grasp the rules and structures that govern the world around her  One example would be her picking a fight with those gangsters as soon as she got to Republic City  only to get in trouble for breaking a whole bunch of laws  Another example would be her first pro bending match  where she ends up using multiple elements and also knocks people off the side ropes  both of which are against the rules  Despite having had the chance to observe the pro bending games  even up close  she never figured either of these rules out until after she was called out for breaking them  I think all of this makes Ti PoLR pretty obvious ,esfp
Why  w  over  w    My loyalty lies with the chancellor  the senate  and with you   Clear    You want more  but know you shouldn t  so    He promises a lot  This is indicative of someone who primarily values loyalty  Ep     I ll come back  I promise  to his mother  Ep     I promise  I won t fail again  to his mother  Ep    Padme   I won t die  I promise   Anakin   No I promise you   He seems pretty intent on keeping these promises  Also Palpatine and Padme are the only ones who ever seemed to understand him  so when Palpatine is about to be killed and he apparently is the only one who can save Padme  Anakin snaps  He ironically takes Yoda s advice the wrong way  and lets go of what he fears to lose  but instead of giving up Padme  he gives up his attachment to all the other jedi  being strictly loyal to Padme and the Empire ,esfp
What did Anakin fear more than anything else  Loss  What led him to the dark side was his fear of losing the ones he loved  What is interesting is this core fear of his doesn t fit any of the nine enneatypes much at all  The closest type that I think this fits is the Two  or maybe the Eight  Maybe the fear of abandonment of a Two could be compared to Anakin s fear of loss of his loved ones  I have a tendency to see Anakin as a rather atypical Type      Twos tend to be the helpful  compassionate type  however in Anakin s case the Two can be pushed to absolute extremes to save the ones they love  and failure to do so leads them to lash out unpredictably at the world  Anakin doesn t fit this compassionate role for anyone outside of those he is truly attached to  I also see some incels as this kind of Two  although involuntary celibacy isn t Anakin s problem  The problem however is shared in both Anakin over loss and abandonment  Losing the ones you care about or are interested in  either to death  or to a gut punching rejection sets these Twos down the dark path for a manipulative genius like Palpatine to prey on them ,esfp
BAHAHAHHAHA AINT NO WAY PEOPLE ARE TYPING THIS OBVIOUS ASS  V AS  V NAHH LMAOOO,esfp
i think anakin is not ESFP like  idk i can explain but in my point of view he s match with ENFP,esfp
Anakin  protagonist of the first three films in the second sequel of the Star Wars saga  has an explosive temper  portrayed by many people as  complicated   as he always sees the bad side of lines and ideas  seeing the good  only when it benefits him    Anakin has repeatedly confronted his master  Obi Wan   showing that he does not oppress for hierarchical sovereignty  as no one can or can silence him  his opinions are always said  no matter the situation  Anakin in several senas of the  prequel  trilogy movies  showed himself a leader  as in the  clonic wars  where in some scenes of the  nd movie  he gives orders to the clones  even next to people with higher positions  like Yoda  he orders a clone to land the ship to rescue Padm   who had fallen in the sand  of course anyone would want to rescue their beloved in this situation  but few would insist as much as Ani insisted  even though they knew it wouldn t be done  Anakin in some scenes showed taking control of the situation putting his master in disadvantaged positions so that he could be the  leader  of the situation  because he is in a condition that he was superior or more experienced  such as when he was doing  radical  maneuvers with his transport in coruscant alongside his master Obi  it may seem like a joke  but in fact  it left Ani in control of the situation  making him feel a  taste of master  as Anakin has been a pilot since childhood    while Obi Wan  had problems with maneuvers and was afraid of heights  in unprotected situations  Looking from a personality typing perspective  it is notorious that Anakin is an extrovert  as in several parts of the saga  he shows the need to express his opinions in a high and clear tone  so that everyone is aware of the  right   in other scenes Anakin shows that he feels the need to be with people  whether they are his friends like Obi Wan  R   or his beloved Padm   he always tried to be present  ever since he was little  he talked a lot  even spoke what he felt  as when he told Padm  that he saw her as an angel in one of his first conversations with her  About the way Anakin sees the world  and how he reacts to external situations  it s noticeable that he s focused on the sensitive side of situations  and he keeps thinking about issues and possibilities all the time  as when he started dreaming about Padm  s death  he thought about it all the time  noticeable with his worried look print all the time after the dream   Anakin is very observant  but an observer of intuition  like most  Jedi  with the use of force the intuition grows inside the person  and he learns to use it as an instrument of battle  the sensation and intuition are one of the greatest characteristics of strength and one of the main abilities of Anakin  who proved to be one of the best users of this power in the entire saga  showing that he captures information from the environment in a very complex way and in no way  only the basic and tactile  Anakin showed himself to be someone who acts on impulse  but not in a sentimental way  he always thought a lot about his actions  even if they harmed people  he made choices if they were good for him and his beloved Padm   Ani proved to be an extremely strategist  drawing plans and goals to achieve what was desired  He s always been someone of high achievable prophecies  like when he said he would win the pod race in the first movie  said and done  or like when he claimed with certainty that he would be the best Jedi  that part opens up arguments  but obviously he is one of the most skillful  or when he claimed to Padm   megalomaniacally  which is one of Anakin s great traits   that he would be the  Emperor  of the galaxy  a feat he fulfilled the mantle of Darth Vader  One of Anakin s characteristics  which is to be impulsive  is one of the biggest labels of decisive personalities  such as the ENTJ  ESTJ who give the impression of impulsive when in fact they have the ability to decide quickly  as they are leaders  One of the main characteristics of Anakin Skywalker  it s his arrogance  and his almost unchanging opinions  that changing them takes a high level of manipulation and argumentation  as Palpatine did when he convinced Anakin that the Jedi are the real villains  Anakin is someone decisive  and straightforward  making decisions quickly  and judging everything and everyone immediately  deciding whether or not you like someone just by getting to know them  Anakin is often treated as insensitive for lack of empathy  being good to people only when it suits him  coldly and callously he murdered the children of the Jedi temple  as he believed this would protect his beloved Padm  from death  being the biggest and perhaps only weak point of Anakin  the woman he loves  Padm  Amidala  as she was instrumental essential for Palpatine to manipulate him  He is a Te Ni user ENTJ ,esfp
Another unfortunate victim of the cp  voters     Anakin s personality is variable  but there are a few aspects that are constant  his desire to protect the people he cares about  and his dread of not having the power and control to do so    Anakin spent much of his youth as a slave  which is one of the worst ways to govern someone  As a result of this  he formed a lifelong loathing for slavery and slavers  This is one of the factors that drives his strong desire to defend the defenseless and achieve strength so that he would never be powerless again   When he experiences visions of his mother s death in Attack of the Clones  he demonstrates his willingness to protect others  When he fails to save her  he becomes enraged and murders all of the sand people as a form of retaliation  bemoaning about his lack of strength   This desire to defend others  and his fear of not being powerful enough to do it  is eventually what brings him down in Revenge of the Sith  After seeing Padme die in a vision  he becomes determined to take control of her fate and save her at any costs  He obsesses over being stronger and stronger since he feels he wasn t powerful enough to save his mother earlier   Love won t rescue you Padme  only my new powers can   he says  believing that power will enable him to defend her   But  in the end  his drive for power and control transforms him into the monster that kills Padme  The knowledge that his attempts to alter his fate only reinforced it  that his search for power led to his impotence  and that his desire to protect the one he loved most resulted in her death  is what finally destroys him and transforms him into Vader   He is an a strong example of a very unhealthy   and his relationship with Padma can prove so  While he does love her  he  protects  her by being overly controlling and beating up any man who managed to be with her    He hates to show vulnerability and hides it between a confident and assertive mask  His strong hatred for being controlled is what became his downfall after Padme s death  Him feeling that the Jedi held him back is what caused him to betray them   There is no anxiety in his motive  it s pure raw anger and impulsivity  He is such a stereotypical  w  and I cant understand why you guys fail to see that and type him as a   ,esfp
What are these ENFP votes ,esfp
He is an ENTJ   w   Tritype      No question  Looking at his becoming of Vader  his intensity in everything he does  his protective nature and confidence to challenge the Jedi masters and forge his own way all scream ENTJ  While this could also just be an argument for just type    look at Vader  ESFP  Are you guys kidding  He s a purist  Do we think a feeler and perceiver because we see him cry when his mother dies  His wrath in Te Dom with secondary Ni is demonstrated in the manifestation of his Ni kill everything in the vicinity rage  you Ni users should know what I m talking about   Does he not demonstrate Te Dom in everything he does  He immediately challenges Windu for not acknowledging him as a master of the Order  His secondary Ni is his consistently being affirmed as he is a natural with the force  even out standish ,esfp
he s obviously a SEE because he can SEE things get it  lmao k i m done,esfp

She s hard to type tho The first   seasons when she s softer and less competitve she seems more like a Fe dom to me but in the later seasons she s definitly a Te dom,estj
She is one of my favourites in the show  I like how task oriented  dependable and obsessive she is  Sometimes can be tiring but is generally cute and relatable ,estj
 V   Now  I need you to be careful and efficient  And remember  If I am harsh with you  it s only because you re doing it wrong      E   When it started I was just trying to be nice to her    before I knew it  we were shopping     F   I hope by maid you mean mistress  because if some other woman was here cleaning        L   Why am I attracted to guys where there s no future  ,estj
Genuine question  If she s Te dominant  how come she couldn t tell time till she was    ,estj
some people really think that she has Fe over Te ,estj
clearly an ESTJ Reason  I KNOW   ,estj
Thank godness this changed  I cringed so hard when she was typed as an Fe dom,estj
Oh no the idiots won  It was only a matter of time,estj
She bought her husband a p rn for Valentine s Day  She also offered food to the man who groped Phoebe  Tell me that s not Fe dom,estj

I personally can t stand ENTP teachers because they always go on the weirdest tangents and get distracted by every little thing  I once had an ENTP science teacher who would just ramble for the whole class and we were supposed to take note of everything he said and he d just pull random stuff from what we remembers telling us and put it on the test,estj

He was e ped phile  and a huge b tch  No judgment on other people with that type tho ,estj
I m not sure if she s an ESTJ or ENTJ  I ll type her as EXTJ for the moment  She s really bossy  she also makes the students feel insecure and she s too judgy  However  she s also the person who will try to help the students when they have a problem ,estj

 Self Preservation Sixes have a fear related to survival a fear of not being protected that fuels a driving need for protection through friendship and other kinds of alliances with others     These Sixes seek to escape anxiety by seeking the security of protection  therefore  they become dependent on others  They have a passion for compensating for the fear of separation  which manifests as warm and friendly temperament      Link    The self preservation subtype I can see to some extent  but definitely is not his first approach after reading all that  It would fit better as an enneatype   social subtype  which is characterized by seeking security through an external authority  which in this case  was the government within the walls    Social   s can be agressive too  Just they will usually show that hostile attitude if someone goes against what they believe is right ,estj
that Te dom is so hot in him   edit  and yeah yeah yeah so this doesn t get flagged or anything  I do believe he s a TeSi  It s quite visible  especially the Si  experience  learning  knowledge  putting those memory pieces together  etc   supporting Te  Then Ne with all the fast thinking  Absolute General role model  ,estj
Before I came here  I was like  Hey  this man is exactly like me  high Te and developed Fi  that s why he s my favorite character in the show  I wonder if his type is actually ESTJ     Well  well  well  no wonder,estj
what are the arguments for ESTP  ive been scrolling for a bit and i cant find any comments about it ,estj
ESTJ  Te dom  Carl Jung describing Te dom    This type will  by defition  be a man whose constant endeavour is to make all his activities dependent on intellectual conclusions  wich in the last resort are always oriented by objective data  whether these be external facts or generally accepted ideas  This type of man elevates objective reality  or an objectively oriented intellectual formula  into the ruling principle not only for himself but for his whole environment  By this formula good and evil are measured  and beauty and ugliness determined  Everything that agrees with this formula is right  everything that contradicts it is wrong  and anything that passes by it indifferently is merely incidental  Because this formula seems to embody the entire meaning of life  it is made into a universal law which must be put into effect everywhere all the time  both individually and collectively  Just as the extraverted thinking type subordinates himself to his formula  so  for their own good  everybody round him must obey it too  for whoever refuses to obey it is wrong   he is resisting the universal law  and is therefore unreasonable  immoral  and without a conscience  His moral code forbids him to tolerate exceptions  his ideal must under all circumstances be realized  for in his eyes it is the purest conceivable formulation of objective reality  and  therefore  must also be generally valid truth  quite indispensable for the salvation of man  The inferiority of feeling in this type manifests itself also in other ways  In so far as it corresponds with the dominating positive formula  the conscious attitude becomes more or less impersonal  often  indeed  to such a degree that a very considerable wrong is done to personal interests  When the conscious attitude is extreme  all personal considerations recede from view  even those which concern the individual s own person  His health is neglected  his social position deteriorates  often the most vital interests of his family are violated    they are wronged morally and financially  even their bodily health is made to suffer    all in the service of the ideal  At all events personal sympathy with others must be impaired  unless they too chance to be in the service of the same formula  Hence it not infrequently happens that his immediate family circle  his own children for instance  only know such a father as a cruel tyrant  whilst the outer world resounds with the fame of his humanity  Not so much in spite of as because of the highly impersonal character of the conscious attitude  the unconscious feelings are highly personal and oversensitive  giving rise to certain secret prejudices  as  for instance  a decided readiness to misconstrue any objective opposition to his formula as personal ill will  or a constant tendency to make negative suppositions regarding the qualities of others in order to invalidate their arguments beforehand in defence  naturally  of his own susceptibility  As a result of this unconscious sensitiveness  his expression and tone frequently becomes sharp  pointed  aggressive  and insinuations multiply  The feelings have an untimely and halting character  which is always a mark of the inferior function  Hence arises a pronounced tendency to resentment  However generous the individual sacrifice to the intellectual goal may be  the feelings are correspondingly petty  suspicious  crossgrained  and conservative  Everything new that is not already contained formula is viewed through a veil of unconscious and is judged accordingly  It happened only in middle of last century that a certain physician  famed his humanitarianism  threatened to dismiss an assistant for daring to use a thermometer  because the formula decreed that fever shall be recognized by the pulse  There are  of course  a host of similar examples   To know more ,estj
Her Te always justifies her actions in the series  heavily relies on facts and strategies and she tends to pay attention to more concrete details in a way to articulate her plans  she always prefer to planning a good and organized strategy first of to play  I think she has SI because she always remembered specific details of everything and every match she plays and used it  a good example it s her match against Miyo  I don t see any Ni for the moment  She is clearly Se blind inferior  she have an avversion for this functions  she always judge this  SE attitude   be always impulsive during the match  uses an  exaggerated quantity of money  or Yumeko s behavior in general  The many possibilities in a match are the essence of gambling for her  so this is an example of tertiary Ne for me  ep    season   ,estj
She s so cool     I wish ESTJs were real,estj
wait how is she a wing    ,estj
If you step on me mommy  I apologize,estj
How does she have secondary SO while being voted as an eight  She s not very protective of others  Not enough for social eight ,estj
I saw more Gamma than delta tbh  this girl has a boiling hatred for Ti  I don t see PoLr Ni aswell ,estj
she is not lse at all guys like when you see that  And for AP she is VFLE i dont see  F in her,estj
ESTJ   is impossible  you cannot have Si and be a  ,estj
Why SCOEN SLOEN ,estj
Already posted on her being EIE before IIRC  Varlawend seems to agree on this typing for her  Would expect it to be fairly uncontroversial in SHS  Seems to have far too much Fe for an ESI at the least  don t see any sign of her having Fe control  and an ESI actor would be very unusual   In terms of subtype  I think she fits well with other people I ve typed EIE H  she fits that general type image  Is a self described introvert which would generally indicate distant subtype and I don t think N subtype fits  she does also seem too connective for an N subtype   Would say D secondary  has some sort of leadership aspect at least  Possible Fi accentuation   seems to have high guilt and does seem to have a focus on morality  though this is typical in EIE lol  ,estj
I m baffled by people saying she s a Te user when her Fe is so blatant  People seem to be typing Hermione instead of Emma Watson ,estj
When people cant accept the fact that ESTJ s can be amazing people and have well developed Fe,estj
wanted to share this great comment buried in a thread by   curiouselephant  to shed more light on why she may not be a Te dom  full credits for this argument go to   curiouselephant     just because she s effecient doesn t mean she s a Te user  Not that black and white  The motive is the key in all of it  Plus I wouldn t describe her as efficient as much as I would composed and conscientious  I feel like people on here are too busy giving ISFJs INFP stereotypes to even see a real SFJ in front of their face  Like ISFJs can be pretty conscientious and have tertiary Ti so they are not inferior a thinking function  and it can at times make them a bit more cerebral seeming  I mean Dr  Holly from Dance moms is another example of this to me   Emma Watson has imparted so much value to ethics  Harmony  people  and rapport  I do not understand why people would even think she s inferior a feeling function when she has made these values very blatant  I do not see her operating the world through the lens of a Te dom that strives to be effective at precision and efficiency with objective data  She just doesn t have that ambition and I feel like when people are structured and carry themselves well people want to call them Te doms  ,estj
I think she has too much fi for it to be inferior  I think we should consider ISTJ  although i m not an expert on her ,estj
Emma is not an Fe user  IXFJ voters  you re disregarding the basic definitions Fi and Fe   there are    personality types    Fe users    Fi users  an Fi user that has  say  inferior Fi  will use this cognitive function differently from an Fi user that has this function as their dominant function  however  there is a similarity between them  Fi collects information and connects it to the individual  all Fi users will collect data and relate it to themselves  Fi makes its user see themselves in the center   it prioritizes the personal needs and feelings of the user  Fe  in contrast  makes its user see themselves as a part of a big whole  of the collective  this is a basic principle of cognitive functions that people often forget   that is not to say that an Fe user isn t capable of prioritizing their personal needs  since all human beings are biologically predisposed to individualistic sentiment  but Fe users tend to have issues understanding their personal feelings and getting in touch with their sense of self  their Fe will make them be inclined to value external morals while neglecting personal opinions or needs  at a young age  Emma was able to openly express her personal motivations  she had an excellent sense of self when she was only      better than the sense of self most young adults have today  I d bet  would it make sense for an IXFJ to be able to simply assert their needs  considering how Emma was a child   hadn t developed her cognitive functions fully  again  Fe users can be assertive   though she asserts her needs and feelings especifically   reveals what she wants openly  she doesn t mention social norms  the group s feelings and needs  to make a point  if you watch her interview at UN  as another user has pointed out on this page   she constantly uses the pronouns  I    my    me     like I said  Fi connects information to the self  to the individual   Fe connects it to the collective   an Fe user sees themselves as just a part of a big whole  her cognitive process is clear  if you analyse her words and the way she communicates her ideas  it s always related to her POV  I m voting her as an ESTJ  but I see ISTJ as a possibility  I d have to watch more interviews to be certain  though I m positive she has Fi  I understand the ISFJ votes  the INFJ ones are just ridiculous  on the other hand  and it is bothersome to see that there is a bias against ISFJs   their ability to be assertive  it is also quite bothersome to see that  for some reason  charismatic or nice XXTJs will be voted as feelers  remember that we take the cognitive functions  theory into account when typing people on this website  and not one dimensional concepts of  F  and  T  types,estj
Regarding her socionics type  wouldn t LSE or ESE make a lot more sense  She doesn t seem to value or talk about just being forceful  socio Se  for the sake of it  as much as she talks about being open to new perspectives and experiences  socio Ne  and providing a nurturing environment for other people to do things  socio Si   LSEs ESEs have demonstrative Se and can still come across forceful  just that they value creating a nurturing and comfortable environment for themselves and others  socionics Si  ,estj
I m sorry  ESTJ voters  But it s just impossible for her not to have Fe    One crucial moment is at https   youtu be cQynYGDpyiw t          You see that s her Fe s diplomatic trait which was stopping and filtering her expression  Meanwhile  ExTJ with their Fi would use that opportunity to openly express what s what   I personally know mature ESTJ women with  good Fe   but Emma is just not ,estj
Her consensus here being similar to Hemione s makes me wonder if a character that you play at a very young age for a very long time  she played Hermione from age    to    or something like that  can affect your own personality    Especially if this character is very famous and you ll be constantly associated with them for the rest of your life   Or maybe it just affects how other people see your own personality because of that association,estj
She might be ESTJ but I don t believe she s socially extraverted based on the quotes a few comments beneath this one  ESTJ but an R instead of S in SLOAN,estj
His enneagram is  w  because he s just simply a PERFECTION,estj
gotta balance it out,estj
You re all welcome I made it ESTJ,estj
what is this   ,estj
No balance,estj
What the hell is this  ,estj
If you make the   p test and make all neutral we will be ISFP  That s what I heard  too lazy to take that test I took months ago ,estj
Its okay guys  i took my vote from ISFP and now things are in balance again ,estj
Guys please we need to keep the ISFP and ESTJ balance,estj
Why is he typed S when his inferior function is Si  ,estj

I know we re all decided on ESTJ for Yanfei  but apparently there s some people that think shes uses Fe   I get that we shouldn t narrow her whole personality to being a lawyer but it kinda is the case with her   She s just a side character and I ve looked in her voicelines and to be honest  I haven t seen anything contradicting that XSTJ lawyer stereotype    Yanfei mostly guides herself by external logic and facts  I don t remember her quest well but the whole thing with her finding out the guy was lying was pretty much Te to me  She didn t even try to make it make sense to her  she used all of the external sources and just throw all of the facts and evidence in that guy s face and he couldn t deny it because she made it very clear  a Ti user would struggle explaining why it makes sense as they make their theories for themselves and they can hardly explain it to others like that  Now for Te Fe there s a voiceline that makes it really clear  sorry that it s so long tho   Civil cases are the ones I dread the most  Divorces  custody disputes    It s a thankless task trying to unpack these kinds of cases with logic and reason  You have to be kind  courteous  and patient with your clients  even though half the time they are completely incapable of participating in a constructive discussion   sigh  I know I advertise myself as being fully versed in every area of the law  but honestly  if it were up to me  I d rather everyone could just get along  so we wouldn t have so many of these cases    This pretty much explains why she doesn t use Fe  She finds herself uncomfortable having to take care of others  feelings as she hardly understands them  Both Fe and Te users are tribe oriented  but Fe users  unlike Te  feel responsible for others s feelings  and Te users just want to guide them to success    thinking that feelings get in the way     Visions appear in response to strong desire  so as someone with ideals  it s only natural that I should have received one  Because  above all  I wish for all people to live honest lives and abide by the law     Again  she  as an EXXJ  a tribe oriented types  has an ideal of all people abiding by the law so she wouldn t have to worry about their feelings  A Fe user would surely at least word it differently  they wouldn t simply give some rules and just be like  deal with it     In any case  whatever the life you live  the most important thing is to respect and understand the law  After all  as soon as you stray from the law  the world begins to fall to ruin     I guess this is okay for her Si aux   We should keep in mind that she s not very well written as she just randomly appeared and had like   quest  she has a pretty stereotypical personality for a lawyer    Do not seek to emulate the past  for there is no law that can suffice for all time     This is a lesson I must always bear in mind  Basically her Si aux is undeniable  I don t get why she would choose to be anything else  I mean her job  if she didn t think the law was so important and everything  Not gonna lie  her Ne is weirdly developed but in the end  that s good anyway ,estj
People really saw a lawyer and typed ESTJ without even reading her character stories and voice lines  There s so much more to her personality than just her job but people just ignore it  Out of all top comments here only one mentions her character story  Everyone just completed one quest where she was just doing her job and typed her based on that  I m not saying she s not ESTJ  I just haven t seen good argument for it yet ,estj
Y all are saying ne dom just because she talks too much  Don t you know that ppl can develop their tert function and use it in a healthy way  To someone who uses the tert function properly  y all immediately call the tert function a dom    Te  To show Krosl s wrongdoing and injustice  paimon and the traveler  both of them can t use te well   presented an unrealistic and troublesome plan  like looking for the buckle   But instead  Yanfei thought of a more practical goal that would allow them to achieve results immediately  and chose the most practical way to make this goal a reality  In addition  she puts only useful information in her plan  not unnecessary information  And she created this plan step by step and proceeded in accordance with this plan and logically    Si  Her memory is very strong  She even remembers book pages  She realized that the stone was fake because she remembered what her grandmother had told her and noticed the concrete details  She made a plan that complies with the rules and will make Krosl unfair by applying the knowledge she has memorized in the past to the present  Te Si    also a healthy ESTJ with well developed ne ,estj
UM WAIT WHY NOT ESFJ    I SEE FE,estj
why i think she is ESFJ I think she have fe more than fi She like justice for public  care for another mor than care herself I think she is fe doms  Or she healty ESTJ that have hight all functions,estj
I still don t get why ESTJ  Because she likes rules  She seems to have high ne and te,estj
i remember only wishing on zhongli s banner just to get her   she s been my sub dps on my main team for a few months now and it s really nice having her   i personally think that her big   is scoai   scoei  she struggles with civil cases because it s difficult for both parties to come to a solid agreement  her personality s really pleasant and friendly  and tries her best to bring justice to her clients with being accommodating to them as much as possible  i d like to hear arguments for scoei though,estj
Why is she Egocentric in big five  I don t know her character that well tbh  but she seemed more Accomodating to me in the teapot quest ,estj
I ve only watched a couple of episodes with my sister and I can      her as an ESTJ  all stereotypes away  I see absolutely Zero   Se   I see Te  Si  Ne  a little developed  and finally Fi  Ni  I don t see it anywhere  but still she might be and ENTJ after all  I m not a one piece expert ,estj
i have not seen a single episode of one piece in my life yet i keep returning to this profile to see if her consensus has changed again ,estj
And why  w  and not  w   Nami is a character focused on her achievements  and goals  She strives to maintain and care for her image  and to gain success ,estj
Here is the link to ESFJ vs ESTJ   https   personalityatwork co personality type ESFJ vs ESTJ  Nami organized people  plans  and activities  She is a no nonsense person  She is practical and realistic but she always thinks of people and having harmony first in the crew  When Usopp left the crew  Nami spoke up against abandoning him  When Zoro sacrificed during the end of Thriller Bark  she took care of him despite not knowing what he did for the crew  When Luffy decided to own up his hurts and sadness after Ace died and sent them a message through the newspaper of meeting two years after  her first response is to go to him and scold him for not asking the crew to support him by his side  When Sanji left  unlike Zoro  she wanted to get Sanji back  But when Sanji disrespected Luffy  she slapped him hard   Compare Luffy who is Fi aux to Nami who is Fe dom  her first response to any conflict is a group decision  Unlike Luffy who  even until now  will always do the things  he wanted to first before what his group needed   Also  Nami is not Fi inferior because she is not driven by her internal framework or morals and beliefs  She acts based on how to meet what the crew needs ,estj
Her dream of making a map of the world is Si  It s an archetypal  absolute perception  that is nonetheless derived from observation of the real world  and her forecasts and navigation skills are another expression of that  Her being an strategist is more Te than Ni  and even her intuition is more concerned with the external world  Ne  than some internal inspiration  Stuff that some people say are Se  like love for money  are more stereotypical traits that aren t directly related to type ,estj
like nami is an ENTJ because it s different from ESTJ who is invited to do stupid things have fun she doesn t want to but ENTJ is a little bit willing to do it playing with usoop and chopper because nami have SE  I remember on Water Island celebrating the victory against Lucci vs Luffy at Water Seven an interview asked Nami  Are you going to sell your bikini photo   and easily nami answered  yes  and I remember when sachi was kidnapped and wanted to be sold on shadoy island when luffy was on the way to a human trading place for things but open sanji not franky nami was the commander at that time  at that time the mugiwara crew had     M berries  i think nami  w    w    w ,estj
I think what seems like Ni is actually Ne combined with her knowledge   I can agree that she look like ni user but  Si Ne   Ni Se she don t look like she have Se,estj
Ni aux over si aux because ni users are tend to be  driven to see the big picture and to understand how thing work down at a fundamental  root cause level  They love theories  concepts  and complex systems  They tend to be strategic   An example is her art of weather and how immersed she got into that by learning all of the aspects of it  Being a strategist is another one of her strengths as she solves things on inner gut ,estj
Na verdade estou em d vida ela tem muitas caracter sticas de ambas as personalidades,estj
    No way   https   www personalitycafe com threads self preservation threes according to beatrice chestnut           Following Ichazo  Naranjo calls this subtype  Security  because these Threes work hard to achieve a sense of security  both in terms of material and financial resources and knowing how to do things effectively  Self Preservation Threes express a concern with security in that they have a need to feel autonomous and self sufficient   TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND OTHERS  People with this subtype often had a childhood in which they didn t have enough protection and resources  In response to those conditions  these Threes learned to be active and efficient doers  oriented to taking care of themselves without help from others  They have developed a special focus on autonomy in the face of a jeopardized sense of security     This preoccupation with security can also extend out to others  This person emanates a sense of security  they are solid people who you might go to for advice  They seem outwardly calm and organized  like they have it all together  but they are anxious underneath  These are assertive people who specialize in solving problems and getting things done in a high quality way   and while they work very hard  they don t show their stress  They are usually financially secure  highly productive  and  in control   but they also report feeling an underlying sense of anxiety related to the effort it takes to achieve the sense of security they crave       With this subtype  the Three s ability to work hard  perform well and maintain the right image are placed in the service of material success  With considerable drive and energy  this subtype can accomplish goals of financial security  a nice home  etc  The danger is losing contact with one s real self in this effort  and becoming overly identified with one s role at work    The Wisdom of the Enneagram        by Don Richard Riso   Russ Hudson  pg         THE SELF PRESERVATION INSTINCT IN THE THREE  Workaholism  In the average range  Self Preservation Threes feel that they must constantly work for security and stability  like Sixes  and want to build up a base of material well being  like Eights   UNLIKE SIXES  SECURITY COMES FROM MONEY  ASSETS  AND A STABLE HOME  NOT FROM LOYALTY TO A COMPANY  IDEOLOGY  OR PERSON    ,estj
I think Iida is a pretty clear self preservation    Anger and perfectionism are always directed at himself  he works hard to make sure everything goes well and usually takes his responsibilities very seriously    You can clearly see the typical worry of this subtype in him  which arises from seeking perfection in every detail  He doesn t see himself as perfect as a social   would  and while there may be some maladaptation on his part  a couple of times   I think he s a lot more harsh on himself than on others ,estj
Can someone explain to me why ESTJ and not ISTJ  Before I even clicked the link to see what type he is in mind said ISTJ  cause he screams Si  When he becomes the leader of his class or becomes a hero  or his studies  or his internship  or when he wants to revenge his brother  he is always driven by a sense of honor obligation  So for me  his motor is Si  not Te  so ISTJ makes much more sense to me than ESTJ  he is not the typical boss like ESTJ hahahaha   but I want to hear people that think he is more like ESTJ to know more about it ,estj
underrated king,estj
He cannot be ESTJ because all ESTJ are mean and evil ,estj
If his type ever changes  I ll be disappointed  This is one of the only ESTJs that are actually healthy  that I ve seen so far  ,estj
Could someone explain to me why is he an ESTJ  I am not sure whether he uses Te Si or Si Te and I d like some clarifications,estj
I can honestly see him being both ISTJ and ESTJ  but I think I ll lean more towards ESTJ  defo type   tho lmfao,estj
If we ever have to decide on who is the most ESTJ person and make someone the king of the ESTJs its him lol,estj
almost the definition of type  ,estj
This is the healthiest ESTJ i ve ever seen I wanted to say the same for kunikida doppo but Unfortunately he s actually ISTJ,estj
I don t think she is on the Si Ne axis  She works for a certain future vision and goal of hers  rather than based on a preexisting duty or responsibility  She doesn t look back to her destroyed home Planet and often doesn t recognize small details in her quest for fulfilling her goal  She is big picture oriented rather than focused on safety Moreover she has great gut instincts and is Good on predicting long term future outcomes  Furthermore she shows much Se usage throughout most of the series  She is quick to use her environment to her advantage in a practical and direct way and is prone to indulge in sensory activities  As her result of her Te Se she is also more impulsive than an ESTJ would be  since because of their Te Ne they are more in their head and considering different scenarios of action  which can make them more reluctant to actually act ,estj
I understand that it s very difficult to type her  but I was rewatching the two trilogies she appears in and I came to the conclusion that she is ESTJ  I see a Te Ne loop in Leia  I understand it might be confused with ENTJ s Ni aux  but her mind works with several opportunities  Ne  and when she sees those opportunities she wants to directly take advantage of them   That attitude of her in episode IV of shooting that duct that gave access to the trash compactor was a fine example of a Te Ne improvisation  although some confuse it with the Te Se loop I disagree with that  She didn t make this decision considering the moment and the local environment  Se  but rather she thought about the possibility that this could be an escape route for her  Han Solo and Luke Skywalker  Ne  ,estj
Loop Te Se                      ,estj
Te dom is obvious  Don t see much evidence for Ni or Si  I feel like tert Se fits better than tert Ne ,estj
 Would it help if I got out and pushed    MBTI     Princess Leia is for sure a Te Dom  a very deliberative leader that is practically minded   it s not a more stereotypically abrasive Te either  like when she s giving orders to the pilots in the Hoth base  she s being very clear and transparent rather than angry and yelling      I do believe that that her auxiliary  sidekick  thought process revolves around Si  operating upon retained impressions of what s familiar to her in order to preserve the Rebellion s safety  using what works   like take when Han Solo decided to try and lose the TIE Fighters in the asteroid field in Empires Strike Back  if Leia were an ENTJ  I wonder if she would be a bit more open minded about it per tertiary Se  but rather she s questioning the safe pragmatism of his maneuver  per Si Ne      Otherwise  far as Fi is concerned  she seems to have a reasonably developed Fi backbone that presents itself more towards her brother Luke  incestua   gags under a Force choke    but otherwise  she puts Han at arm s length in terms of more emotionally intimate connections per Te Si deliberative professionalism   ENNEAGRAM      w  makes sense  Princess Leia dedicates herself to moral principles of good when it comes to fighting against the dystopian corruption of the Empire and then Wing   as she operates upon being a guardian over the Rebellion she commands      I think she more reasonably integrates into more relaxed  healthy  like behaviors with more open about spontaneity and taking a breather the night on Endor s forest moon before the last skirmish with the Empire  her inferior Fi coming through in more readily embraced connections with Luke and Han      Otherwise  she does get more pushed down to   like unhealthy moodiness when faced with stress whether it be Han pushing her buttons  METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING  or when either Han or Luke where in danger  such as when Han was frozen in carbonite or Luke making his way to Darth Vader on Bespin as well   PERSONAL THOUGHTS     Princess Leia s character was interesting right from the get go  being a political spokesperson from within the Empire that opposed the Empire s corrupt authoritarianism to a strong and capable leader of the Rebellion      As other comments here have alluded to  it s interesting how the Skywalker siblings are cognitive reverses of each other  each representing   sides of the coin in the effort against the Empire  Luke being an idealist that challenges the moral and philosophical stances of the Sith Lords behind the Empire and Princess Leia taking pragmatic steps to make decisive moves against the Imperial forces      It s just a shame that Disney pissed and shitted on her character story in the new trilogy  like it was nice to see some of her interactions with older Han and then some weird Force projection with Luke  but it wasn t enough and then they mishandled her death   like  it there was a big sacrifice to be had in The Last Jedi  it would ve been a bittersweet send off for Commander Leia to sacrifice herself for the safety of the Resistance rather than the hOlDo mAnUeVeR   Thank you ,estj
i like the idea of luke and her being opposites  both contributing to the rebellion in different ways  luke  an idealistic hero  whose ideals foster a change of heart in darth vader and leia  a rational leader  who does what is necessary to take down the empire  the empire could not have been eradicated without luke s hope in his father  but leia s level headedness was needed in a position of leadership    ,estj
I think she s an    not a    She can be moralistic like a    at least relative to Han   but she doesn t try to control her anger  she lets people know how she feels  She makes it clear that she is in charge  and seems to care more about  her people   the rebels  than objective morality ,estj
ESTJ in the movies  ENTJ in the expanded universe  Hence some confusion  When she is forming the rebellion in The Force Unleashed Video Game for example  she is quite Ni  but in the Original Trilogy she is just a by the book Si user  annoyed that Han isn t following procedure  ESTJ talk a lot more too  that is a dead giveaway  If you annoy an ESTJ  she will immediately let you know ,estj
Is she ENTJ or ESTJ  bc I keep switching between the two every time I come to this comment section  At first  I voted ENTJ  then was convinced she was ESTJ  and now I m not sure anymore ,estj
she s ENTJ  Ni   Si for days  like that scene where she s able to sense exactly where Luke is hanging or when she knows that they re twins   alone  these   major predictions would convince me of at least aux Ni  but that s not all  we see this Ni develop quite a lot throughout her life  becoming extremely wise  future oriented  a visionary  and she sees the big picture  like that speech she gives to Han in Ep    and I think Leia uses a fair amount of Se compared to Ne  her strategies are always based on sensory observation and in the moment impulsion  like her escape from the Death Star  there is absolutely no Ne conceptualization or fantasy  this is not an intuitive bias  it s just plain facts  but if anyone can combat this with real evidence  please  comment below   D,estj
tbh he screams head triad  all of      and   can apply for him in some aspect  but why  w   specifically ,estj
in  the avatar and the firelord   toph asks if friendships really can last multiple lifetimes  everyone starts holding hands and sokka goes   WElLlLLLLLL scientifically speaking there s no way       his inability to even consider fortunetelling can also kinda for the same reason  he likes to consider the material and cold hard facts instead of the hypothetical or metaphysical ,estj
I have been enlightened to the comedic potential of ESTJs  but he definitely becomes a bit of an ENTP later on after focusing on his Ne a bit too much ,estj
Guys  ez way to determine if he is ESTJ  Is he a dictator  Is he evil  Is he overtly angry and yells  Is he forceful  If you answered yes to all of that  you ve found your average ESTJ ,estj
Ok guys PLEASE hear me out  Sokka is a  w  he is constantly motivated by his feelings of worthlessness  and only truly develops after he is honest with himself and learns his true worth with the swordmaster  Sixes are motivated by their sense of security  but Sokka isn t  he is motivated by feeling useful  Threes are striving toward what the people in their life define as success  In his world that is being a warrior and a leader like his father  On the eclipses invasion ep  he is embarrassed by not being able to give a speech like his father  this is not because he feels like his security is at risk  but because he was not successful  in being a leader  and useful  He finds himself constantly being dragged around by others that will give him a job to do like fishing in the storm ep and hunting in the jet ep  In that ep he is manipulated by jet  because jet understands Sokka s insecurities  and knows that through praise and dismissal  Jet undermines Sokka s natural leader position and takes advantage of the fact that Sokka is easily swayed by praise  but when Sokka starts to doubt Jet  Jet uses Sokka s previous jealously to get to Katara and Aang  If Sokka was a six he wouldn t have suspected Jet because he would have been to preoccupied with the sense of stability of security that Jet s leadership would have provided  If you still have doubts  PLEASE respond I could write essays about this  ,estj
Te  Extraverted thinking  as Junghinian Cognitive functions establishes a World laws based on  external facts  and  functionality   reaching  logical conclusions  which should be abided by all people all the times  For me fits very well in Sokka  from the first episode  In some episodes  I don t remember which ones  he was in a clear inferior Fi grip  when he had an identity crisis  when he doesn t want to loses his leadership position cause of his fear to lose identity  He is completely focused on outsourcing to build routes and plans  He is literally willing to trample anyone to get what he wants  Te  Fi   sometimes he may appear egoist and motivated to protect his squad  but always wurh a purpose  including this    I remember some episodes  He has a sense of morality and deep authenticity  but always prefers to be impersonal and unemotional  I will accept more ENTJ than ENTP honestly,estj
I can see why some might type him as ENTP  as he is the stock ENTP side character  He s witty  outspoken  wants to have fun  and comic relief  but I have to agree with the majority saying that he s ESTJ  It s also worth taking his enneagram  w  into the picture here  which makes him seem less composed and serious than ESTJs are generally portrayed as  The tough as nails thick skinned and decisive portrayal of ESTJs is most likely seen when paired with one of the assertive enneagram types  especially  s and  s ,estj
I dont understand why anyone thinks he uses te   si  The episode where he studies under the sword master is the best example of his ne   ti  I think sokka tries to be somewhat of an ESTJ but realizes on his journey that his real skill is his creativity and outside of the box thinking   In the first season of the show he tries to be a practical warrior leader like his father because hes the oldest male left of his tribe  but anytime he tries to be practical he fails and makes a fool of himself  The more times he gets humbled  the more he starts to use his actual strenght which is his unique way of strategizing and coming up with plans    Also for anyone saying that they dont see any ti in him  there are lots of good examples of his ti  for example when hes the only one who doesnt trust the old bloodbender lady  Or Jet or the Joo Dees    A good example of his si ne is when he seriously believes ridiculous things like that appa ate momo after aang and momo dissapeared  And when he writes a fake apology letter for katara after her and toph had beef  but forgets that toph is blind and cant read write  Also katara complains multiple times during the series that she needs to wash his clothes and do all the chores  so that could be another argument for low si   People also tend to interact with the world with their extroverted functions  so his comedic attitude could be his ne fe interaction style  wanting to joke and make people laugh     Sry if my english is bad  btw  ,estj
Why I think Sokka is an ESTJ  Dominant extroverted thinking  He was a leader  and had a bossy  domineering attitude  He was efficient and goal oriented and wanted to get things done  He wanted to be in control and make sure everyone was on track  IMO this was his most noticeable function   Auxilary introverted sensing  His si can be seen in his attachment to objects  In season   episode   he lost his boomerang and he felt as if he had lost a part of himself   I feel like I ve lost a part of my identity   He was also extremely loyal to his allies  This may be stereotypical  but his si can also be noticed in his traditional  narrow minded beliefs in the beginning of the show  Si has also been described as prioritizing comfort and how you physically feel which he often does  for example  he s always the one that wants to get food or go to sleep  Whether these descriptions of si are accurate or not  he fits all of them   Tertiary extroverted intuition  Sokka was irritated by new possibilities and perspectives showing ne lower in his stack  You can notice his low ne clashing with Aangs dominant ne when he gets annoyed at him mentioning different potential scenarios and ideas  His ne began to develop when he started becoming more flexible and open to other perspectives  He began letting go of those small minded views  Another indication of his ne developing is when he became more comfortable with spontaneity later on in the show   Inferior introverted feeling  His inferior fi is at odds with his dominant te  He struggles to find his identity outside of his leadership and what s expected of him    The recent edit was just me fixing grammar mistakes    ,estj
remember when he was an ENTP  but anyway obvious te dom,estj
I m hella shocked when I saw he isn t typed  w    I can see why he d be  w  tho BUT still  he has strong work ethics and is perfectionist  it hurts seeing him e  lmao,estj
Textbook ESTJ   Te   FACTS FACTS FACTS  this man lives on objective truth and disregards everything that doesn t conform to it  I think this is fairly obvious to everyone   Si    People can learn in many ways  but experience is the best teacher   I m going to disregard the fact that he s traditional because that s not necessarily Si but he makes decisions based on Te Si  If it worked before and is trustworthy why change it   Ne   Dwight is a creative problem solver  he indulges in his Ne every time he s relaxed   Fi   Distrusts feelings  warns Michael to use his head for business and leave his heart for love  I think a good Fi moment was when he tried to save Oscar after having him beaten up ,estj
The king of social    Don t type him as so blind because he lacks social skills  Social  s aren t known for being socially charismatic   Here s a description of social     Here is what I call a  Prussian character   Social E  is cold  very formal  Kant  for example  was a great philosopher  He was Prussian  and Prussians had that character form that has a great love of precision and an intolerance for ambiguity  This is precisely the complete opposite of the six conservation  which is warm and feels too permissive for ambiguity  Among the Nazis there were many social six  Their behavior is very visible   this is the line  the party line  the line that defines which are the good guys and which are the bad guys     and what we need to do and we do it very efficiently   In efficiency  the social E  is similar to an E   Ichazo used the word duty  it is more than just being concerned with duty  since the social six are concerned above all with the reference point  They have the mind of a legislator  the categories clear  Their intellectual orientation is to know very well where the north is  where the south is  and the west  and the east  and     And if you ever wanted to become human  you would first need to go crazy and forget about all the points of reference  They need to forget duty   no duty   and connect with instinct and intuition  with life    Here s a description of sx   for contrast   And here is the so called counterphobic character  sexual E  goes against fear  So we could call this neurotic need force  On a descriptive level  we can say strongly in the same way that a six conservation can be branded as a weak person  One is a rabbit and the other is a bulldog  a counterphobic is a lot like a barking dog  It doesn t always bite  it barks more than it bites  but it does look fierce  The need is not only to feel strength  but also to be able to intimidate  The internal program says that the best defense is a good offense  A very illustrative joke about it  a man went to visit several psychiatrists because he heard wings noises in his bedroom that prevented him from sleeping  A novel psychiatrist gives him a gun telling him that he is going to end his phobia by shooting   because you know you are stronger   The next thing was a great scandal  the man killed his guardian angel  So these are the madmen who go against danger  who can kill anyone because anyone can turn into something dangerous    TL DR  social  s are more   like  sx  s are more   like  He s more ridged  efficient  and formal then overly aggressive and confrontational ,estj
I can only DREAM of becoming such an elite ESTJ ,estj
Jim helped him develop his Ne and Pam helped with his Fi  That s they were best friends by the end of the show  but did not like each other at first ,estj
This guy being so blind to everything around him makes him kind of wholesome for an ESTJ lmao  You cant help but feel for him,estj
I think he might be an INFP,estj
 People learn in lot of different ways  but experience is the best teacher ,estj
I can also see the   in his tritype by S  EP  ,estj
Rewatching for the first time and it gets pretty clear that his relationship with Angela going back and forth is ALL due to his Fe demon ,estj
Are there any examples of her si    Im Starting to consider ENTJ tbh,estj
No wonder why I saw myself In her,estj
Why choleric phlegmatic over choleric dom,estj
Why social blind  She literally said that she became a sorcerer to prove to the family that she is not weak   I m still very uncertain about her MBTI type  if it s ESTJ or ENTJ  The ESTJ consensus is very relatable  but I think she also shows many traits of ni ,estj
The anime character that looks identical to her MBTI avatar ,estj
I thought she was sp so  ,estj
There s so much material and so many important life choices of her made around herself  sp  and her clan  so  that tbh I don t even know where to begin but I will leave this comment and probably come back with a structured chronology LOL,estj
last week i actually reality shifted into jujutsu high and we fuckeddd and i can confirm she s an ESTJ  w      SCOEN choleric phlegmatic trust me,estj
She litterlay look like ESTJ    personalities female avatar,estj
literally my older sister,estj
Not sure why but this guy gives off really strong ENFJ vibes to me lol,estj
This guy basically summarizes everything wrong with unhealthy Te lmfao    I love money   That unhealthy inferior Fi touch  And also guys have you noticed that he values money more than people around him sometimes  Like it s crazy how unhealthy that Te is  he only sees people as means to achieving his goals  nothing else      His Te is also obvious in that he will do even the craziest of things to achieve his goal  more money lmao   and he really just doesn t care about the sentimental impact it will have on the external world  Te   Fe  as long as it doesn t cause logistical problems   like a law suit or something   He always finds the most efficient and effective path to arrive at his goals  he s almost like a bulldozer  bulldozing through everything and everyone as sentimental factors are completely unaccounted for during his decision making process      His inferior Fi is obvious in that he has almost no personal values  he doesn t care about the morality of his actions  The one and only thing that he values is money  and nothing else    As for the perceiving axis  I think Si   Ne makes sense as he is pretty grounded and has an established way of seeing the world  and everything new kinda has to align with that or else it s shut down immediately  His Introverted side  Si Fi  only permits that he uses Ne   only  if it fits his subjective scheme  more money of course   Like he ll come up with the craziest ideas on the spot in order to earn more money   Te   Ne serving Fi ,estj
Mr  Krabs is guided by his dominant Te and auxiliary Si  Krabs established  operates  and manages a fast food restaurant that is designed to make him as much money as possible  His entire goal is to get richer  and he is willing to do anything even for a single cent  Aside from his business  Krabs annually competes in the Fry Cook Games  using the notoriety of the event to display the competence and aptitude of his employees and highlight the quality of their service and the meals they prepare  When he discovered the people in town immediately took to fads such as jellyfish jelly  Krabs went out of his way to source jellyfish from the wild and built a factory to extract that jelly  When he lost out on a popular trend  pretty patties   Krabs wanted to buy out SpongeBob s stock and manage the operation himself  Krabs tried to graverob and eventually buy off SpongeBob s lucky hat after he saw how valuable it is   When kids were on summer vacation  Krabs designed an amusement park within his premises to lure them inside  To market his business to preteen and teenage girls  Krabs hIred Pearl as a design consultant and a supervisor to redesign the restaurant s aesthetic  Just because he heard a single customer state how he wanted a Krabby Patty after hours  Mr  Krabs decided to open his restaurant       He stole what he thought was an oyster s pearl to sell it  He made a bet with his rival Plankton to make money on a card game  Krabs even used Te whenever he is alert to Plankton s schemes  going out of his way to investigate his rival s behavior in multiple episodes  F U N   Imitation Krabs  to determine whether Plankton truly changed for the better or if he is up to no good  Krabs hired SpongeBob and Patrick to paint his house  and he hired SpongeBob and Squidward to help him with clam fishing  When SpongeBob lost his motivation to work in Pickles  Krabs went out of his way to snap SpongeBob out of his depression  During his midlife crisis  Krabs did anything he could to feel young again  even go on panty raids with SpongeBob and Patrick  To save himself from Davy Jones s locker  Krabs became more generous and operated his restaurant so he would give back to his customers  Krabs makes things happen whenever the opportunity for wealth arises  Krabs solves problems and clears obstacles on his path towards more money  His Te is very strong   Krabs also has Si  We see that he is operating entirely within his family tradition of being a cheapskate  He owned and operated the same business location for decades before SpongeBob came along  He keeps a proprietary ingredient a secret from everyone at the restaurant  even from his employees  He wanted to pawn SpongeBob off to his universe s version of hell for    cents  Krabs is very cheap with his money  as his other possessions are tattered and extremely old  his dingy clam boat  his house which has a broken wooden floor  and the squeaky boots   He framed his first ever dollar bill on his wall  showing his sentimental value towards past achievements  He wanted SpongeBob to only paint the walls and nothing else  and even then he had SpongeBob use an easily removable paint in case he didn t  showing how cautious he can be  He was protective of his first ever penny and accused and even fired Squidward of stealing it from him  He was protective of his flowers in The Chaperone  wanting SpongeBob to stay away from his prized garden   Krabs was extremely nervous when he was set up on his date with Mrs  Puff  making sure she was happy and only showing the best parts of himself to her  He didn t even have the courage to break it off with her  Krabs s business is on the outskirts of the city  never once moving from its original location  Krabs also rarely changes up his menu  only doing so to profit from trends  He never innovates unless it is financially secure  He was skeptical of SpongeBob s pretty patties at first  He is skeptical of others acting in good faith  such as Squidward not stealing his dime  or Plankton not trying to screw him over  Krabs was very afraid of the Hooks and warned SpongeBob to stay away from them   Mr  Krabs occasionally uses Ne  He adopted a clown persona and built an amusement park to engage with young potential customers  He entertained Pearl s modifications to the restaurant and the uniforms  He allowed SpongeBob  a trusted employee  to chaperone his daughter to a prom  Krabs allowed the restaurant to host after hour events such as the comedy club  a Halloween party  and a talent show  When people were throwing inventory tomatoes at Squidward  Krabs sought the opportunity and charged for them  Krabs can socialize with his employees outside of a professional relationship  such as the marching band  Squidward s pretend five star restaurant  Pressure  and as the super friends  Krabs can get outside the box whenever there is something to be gained from it  He does not fear the future but embraces change if profitable ,estj
         My role model,estj
What is even happening to the functions of spongebob characters     Mr Krabs is apparently both Fi dom and Fi inferior and is also Te dom and Te auxiliary and also Si auxiliary and whAT      ,estj
ok the   votes and   votes are ridiculous  most of the arguments have been  he s a   he wants financial stability  or  he s an   he wants power over his employees   it is quite clear that no one who has voted has read the self preservation   descriptions     Following Ichazo  Naranjo calls this subtype  Security  because these Threes work hard to achieve a sense of security  both in terms of material and financial resources and knowing how to do things effectively  Self Preservation Threes express a concern with security in that they have a need to feel autonomous and self sufficient to know how to take care of themselves and others   People with this subtype often had a childhood in which they didn t have enough protection and resources  In response to those conditions  these Threes learned to be active and efficient doers  oriented to taking care of themselves without help from others  They have developed a special focus on autonomy in the face of a jeopardized sense of security   This preoccupation with security can also extend out to others  This person emanates a sense of security  they are solid people who you might go to for advice  They seem outwardly calm and organized  like they have it all together  but they are anxious underneath  These are assertive people who specialize in solving problems and getting things done in a high quality way and while they work very hard  they don t show their stress  They are usually financially secure  highly productive  and  in control   but they also report feeling an underlying sense of anxiety related to the effort it takes to achieve the sense of security they crave   source  Beatrice Chestnut description of the Self Preservation    wanting security is a key trait of THIS TYPE i don t know why people keep forgetting this  also it would be disingenuous to say that he wants  financial security  he wants an excess of wealth to fuel something greater than security  as for the   argument  that comes from the ever so common misconception that  s love  power    s are originally characterized by Naranjo as craving a sensory lust and thrilling experiences  where is that apparent as a key trait of Krabs  not to mention even though he is the countertype of   which naturally counters vanity  he is still quite competitive with others and driven to accumulate as much money and as much customers as possible  starting to think this website votes any likable   as something other than a   because this site s hate b ner for  s  ,estj
wouldn t SCOEN make more sense ,estj
 Oh  no  I ve seen this on the late show  You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards  Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards    Total Si memory man,estj
When i think of ESTJs  this guy is the first person that comes to my mind ,estj
Definitely    his desire for money stems from his poverty as a kid   s obtain wealth more for the sake of autonomy or greed  Krabs trademark   as opposed to a   s desire to obtain money for attention or status  I don t even see how   is the most popular vote here  Krabs is like a trademark           ,estj
Why are ENTJ votes so low ,estj
From my personal experience  Te doms don t care about little things nearly as much as feeling dominants  Sure they can have a sense of entitlement like Fe doms  but they are objective   not typically the type to let petty things take up their time  Even when I ve seen Te doms get into a Fi grip  they aren t outwardly neurotic rather i see them become reclusive  distracted from their goals or plans and show a vulnerability they rarely would any other time  On the other hand  unhealthy Fe doms I know of behave exactly like a Karen especially including incoherent screaming  victimisation and threat of soical consequences of some kind  like calling authorities  ,estj
Nyahahahah ESTJ is the opposite of INFP so I m going to say that all of you who voted ESTJ were complimenting me   ,estj
ESTJs  ESTJs i know arent that delusional and arrogant,estj
i literatelly have karen haircut so yes,estj
INFPs in Te grip,estj
Every Karen I have ever met was a   ,estj
haha yes personality database let me vote on whi h Attitudinal Psyche is most likely to be a karen,estj
Karens are literally unhealthy  w s  if it actually existed   A Karen s traits are basaically unhealthy core    The only reason why I d vote  w  is b c  w  just doesn t make sense  Also  Karens don t have core   traits  It would have to be at least w  and the reason why Karens aren t  w  or  w  is pretty self explanatory ,estj
Karens are ESFJ  Not cuz they re feelers or because I M ESTJ but because ESFJ are just prone to use subjective logic over objective logic  Karens definitely use Si  but they are always looking for what s best for themselves  LET ME REITERATE  THIS IS NOT A FEELER TRAIT BUT AN UNHEALTHY USE OF FE AND SI AND DO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH THE UNHEALTHY USE OF FI   The most annoying ppl aren t always ESTJ or ENTP  but I hope nobody thinks Karens even are ENTPs  I HOPE NOT   I also can t believe I m saying this but Karens care about ppl  As long as they don t go against their subjective view of the world   Also  the pfp is just so karen is hilariously creepy    did I just make a phrase up  Hilariously creepy ,estj
Even though there are a lot of ISFPs tsundere  I think te dom is more suited to tsunderes ,estj
If anything  an ENTJ would be more than an ESTJ  Most ESTJs can be warm in a sense because of their ne ,estj
I think there is a big confusion about what it is to be a Tsundere  As a definition  it is said that is someone who rejects emotions  but in reality Tsunderes reject only positive emotions  those related to love and affection  Tsunderers really get carried away by their emotions in an insane way  manifesting their affection as anger  Inferior Fi manifests itself with a refusal to be carried away by emotions regardless of whether they are positive or negative  it is for this reason that in reality there are more ISFPs Tsunderes than ESTJs,estj
alright  what is the difference between ESTJ Tsundere with ISFP Tsundere  and also what is the difference between  w  Tsundere with  w  Tsundere ,estj
the votes are very similar to the girl the image,estj
Are ExFPs are the least tsundere among Fi n Te users ,estj
ISFP and then INFPs fi dom act cold at first usually if somene likes them,estj
I can see ESTJ but most tsundere s I ve seen are ISFP   But I read something that said that most choleric tsundere mbti is ExTx  Also  I m ENFP and kind of a tsundere ,estj
I see the ESI votes are rising  I long for the day PDB finally understands what Socio Fi is   The kind of emotional dishonesty characteristic of tsunderes isn t very compatible with Base Fi  ESIs are typically in touch with their feelings and attitudes towards other people and while these feelings may go unexpressed  it would be highly unusual for their external behavior to be so at odds with their internal assessments   To quote Augusta    Everyone should be aware of the feelings they evoke in others  Only weak  insincere people hide their feelings  Sometimes it is wise to keep quiet for the time being  but when the long awaited time comes  when this truth can be revealed  the ESI will do so with double satisfaction     Anything that makes these relationships more understandable is good  anything that complicates them is bad  That is why ESIs are often sharp in their feelings   they can say  I admire him  and  I hate him  with equal ease    ESI isn t a tsundere  ESI is the  I m not a tsundere  I actually just hate you  meme   SLE isn t a terrible choice but  violent  doesn t mean strong Se  Most of these characters only use force as an emotional reaction  Given the tendency to ignore or mask inner attitudes  the volatile emotional responses and the clumsy  over the top use of violence  I m surprised there are no EIE votes ,estj
ah yes  te te fi fi,estj
we just need   more ESTJ votes everyone  ,estj
Pra mim Capric rnio   claramente ISTJ e n o ESTJ,estj
I m a Capricorn and yet I don t act like one at all    ,estj
is it very weird that i  a capricorn  am literally the opposite of this or     lmao i don t get it,estj
i m an ISTJ capricorn ,estj
Finally  ESTJ Capricorn  we made it guys      For those of you who voted for ISTJ  I think you have a misunderstanding to differentiate between extrovert and introvert cognitively  Extroversion in cognitive function refers more to  is this individual focused on the external or internal world   and has absolutely nothing to do with  Is this individual noisy or socially quiet    This is why there is a term an Extroverted Introvert or vice versa  because there are quiet shy people who stick to their external environment and cheerful people who are fixated on their internalization more  For example  an INFP is described as hyperintroverted and so detached from their environment that they rarely or never speak at all  While I can be very friendly and stuttering  I still prioritize the natural wealth of imagination in my head  so I tend to focus more on my internal world  Capricorns without a doubt fall into this category  they like routine and order  but that doesn t mean their Si is much better than their Te    Capricorn is a  Te  sign  inductive thinking at applying their logic in a useful and rewarding action  They re pretty much about efficiency in their work  or work in general and they were created to teach us that  They analyze deductively in detail about things with the aim of categorizing them into  effective  or  ineffective  portions  which indicates part of Si supports their Te function and NOT otherwise  If they were a Si dom  they may prefer to do things slowly   carefully  and they may spend more time planning than doing  Saturn as the ruling planet means they have a dominant Thinking function and a balance between intuition and sensing  You may not see their Ne everywhere  but they use it to help with their dom aux function  They can be very grasping with all the possibilities and new experiments on curiosity if it is indeed useful for the external organization they hold  How would you imagine if an ESTJ used their Ne  Whether it s opening up new jobs  making ideas for office organizations or changing from previous plans to new ones  I can personally see Capri in a state using this mindset  They re also known to come off with sarcastic jokes  as they have this kind of sarcastically dry sense of humour that sometimes can be hilarious  But behind that  they have a very  very hard time tuning in and expressing their feelings  or even they think that emotions are just a lump of self feeling that interferes with success in life  Do we really have to rest and enjoy the activities we love if that is an obstacle to my successful live  Why should we follow the moral principle of all when there are more effective things we can do  That s more or less how Capricorn perceives their weak function as a demon interfering with their dominant function s learning     Capricorns are constantly competing with themselves  They do want praise  though  Not adulation  just praise  Praise is a simple acknowledgment of a job well done  Praise is a pat on the back  They use this as validation to compensate for general feelings of incompetence and inferiority  They plow through adversity with blinders on until they reach success    Capricorn is the peak of  w   they don t seek security or order at all like a   or    or like how Cancer and Virgo prioritize it  They work hard for success with the aim of eliminating feelings of incompetence and invalidity  They want to be praised  and they retract their sense of procrastination in favor of this  What makes them a  w  is the difference between a w  and a w  themselves  The biggest difference between  w  vs  w  is that  w  s core desire is to be the best at serving others whereas  w  tends to care more about being the best at your service  individualist   Isn t Capri a person who works hard for their own success and validation  Aren t they a loner wolf who spends their time being ambitious individually  That s how they really are  they are the REAL  w  ,estj
Oh yeah  how nice it changed from ISTJ to ESTJ now  As many have said  being an intro extrovert socially and being an intro extrovert cognitively are very different things  In the cognitive process you direct a process of perception and judgment with the external and the internal  It is possible for an extroverted type to be reserved and shy  as well as an introverted type to be sociable and outgoing  And I would say that Capricorn and Aquarius are the two signs that fall into that category    Capricorn is pure Te  Indeductive thinking aimed at applying their logic in a useful and rewarding action  This sign is very much about efficiency in everything  looking for and categorizing what is useless and what is competent  Because he is ruled by Saturn  he definitely has balanced Si Ne  His Si manifests itself a lot in relation to the structure that he guides on society  He uses trusted experiences to define an organization that can simplify and make everyday life easier  He also uses cause effect strategies  an action causes a reaction  and analyzes the details to plan in a filtered way  A good Te and Si combo  I can see Ne Tertiary perfectly on him too  Capricorn is very much attuned to the possibilities that may emerge  but those possibilities are very realistic  It could be a job opening  a new item in a store to buy  and also to create a plan C for their plan B  Endowed with qualities that are in tune with the possibility of obtaining fulfillment in the concrete world  Capricorns generally use their abilities in this sense  Whether searching for ascension or deviating from the fiercest competitions  He is tuned into different choices and situations  he just doesn t use them in an exploratory and visionary way like in other High Ne Users  But he still has a good use of Ne  and genuine as tertiary  His Fi Inferior  oh gosh  the way he uses productivity above all and forgetting about be in tune with his inner emotional development says it all   But can we talk a little bit about their enneagram  I agree that he is  SP   or    Capricorn does seek security and order  but nothing compares to the desire for status and external recognition that this sign craves  Capricorn is hardworking not only for reasons of duty  but he is extremely ambitious and has a need to adapt to the expectations society expects of him  I don t see him being reactive and attached to external sources  he prefers to BE the external source actually  for support like a    I don t see it having the security compliant need of that enneatype   s and  s also look for safety and security  I can see   in his tritype  Aren t Capricorn and   literally linked to greed  Aren t they both focused on being competent and self sufficient  Reserved and mature energy  Difficulty opening up  Afraid of being emotionally invaded  All the cards are exposed guys   But one thing that catches my attention about this sign its his w   I don t know if many voted  w  simply because it s the most introverted and least people oriented    but even so  Capricorn has a lot more correlation to a   more than many of you here might think  Capricorn is represented by a mystical being that is a goat with a fish tail  The son of origin between heaven and earth  The upper part  of the goat  represents the matter  the real  the tangible values of the earth  everything that we know about Capri  the stereotype basically  While his fish tail  is the interiorization  the search for diving into the spiritual world  Capricorn is very connected to the higher purpose that is proposed to precisely that side of the tail connected to the sky  Given the search for new paths to something higher by Sagittarius  the sign of Capricorn manages to establish deep inner emotions  full of faith and misery at the same time  Capricorn therefore lives in this constant struggle to adapt to his work and external approval  but feeling that his authenticity is being devalued and misunderstood  Despite the grumpy and cold stereotypes  what ends up being ignored and unspoken that has made many not know is  Capricorn is quite emotionally sensitive and complex too  he s just very private about it  This duality of value is basically the constant struggle in  w   w   So yes  Capricorn doesn t just have a w   he has a STRONG w   I see that is a sign who has a lot to offer when he finally opens up  Like probably any type    he is quite different from his image  the true Capricorn without being the typical hardworking and powerful boss  he is quite admirable in his glory  But their inner strength and wise emotions are amazing  I ve read somewhere that this is a sign very likely to be a great philosopher and be in the area of wisdom  After all  maturity is not just about credit cards and knowing how to use bank machines  It is also experience  knowing the meaning of life  Capricorn is definitely a gift with an incredible surprise inside  you just need to have the patience to unwrap it ,estj
Oh  finally changed  Capricorn is archetypal Te Si  and Fi inferior,estj
Capricorn ENTP,estj
WE LOVE YOU HEALTHY ESTJ WOMEN,estj
it s fun how all ESTJ woman has a lot of ESFJ votes,estj
Honestly watching her and how she s voted is definitely something i see in myself  Te is attuned to external systems and structures including hierarchy  and expectations  This is why you see so many of these exaggerated ExTJ stereotypes being image conscious even when their not  s or very  conformative   Regardless  each function is complex and multiple faceted  So Fe usage is more than just  I want to be one of the cool kids   What child didn t go through a phase in which the wanted to be a  cool kid   especially in American Society  Fe doms who want to fit in  will go about it in very inauthentic  self sacrificing fashion ,estj
okeh but can someone helps me figure out whether im a fe or te dom  like fgs it has been   months since im figuring out my dom funcs btw im an enneagram   n abt myself im in tune w others feeling but not my first consider like i do think what they will feel when i say something or do something to  em but most of the times i ignore it lol or just slow down a bit but still keep what the hella things i wanna say do organized person sometimes not  goes to enneagram   be like  highly want validation driven like  s ofc kinda bossy but in a nice way lol non of my friends say that im a such a ppl pleaser n ik it im not into ppl so much just i always consider their feelings not into keeping harmony cause i somewhat luv conflicts jk always finish work on time  efficient but sometimes not  okeh simply here if i im in tune w ppl s feeling but not rlly care either n ppl are not my first thingy as well as harmony  it s always abt me i always focus on lol  so am i TE bcs ik im a si user i rlly can relate w nancy n hermione sm but im not mean yet still lots of sympathy thanks if u re willing to help ,estj
Inferior Fi  Tf  I was thinking possibly ISTJ but that has like   votes ,estj
Why ESFJ  Nancy has no fe and she is definitely a Te dom ,estj
as pessoas que est o votando ESFJ est o fazendo isso pq n o est o acostumados a ver uma ESTJ saud vel  mas a Nancy   obviamente uma Te dom,estj
The last time I saw her profile  she was an ESFJ  lol  Maybe because she had to put on a facade to appear cool and all  seems dom aux Fe like     but it was a phase that most teens undergo  Te dom does make sense but  I can t be sure ,estj
See  this is an AMAZING example of a healthy ESTJ ,estj
A very hard working  ambitous and inspiring protagonist  Really showing healthy and right representation of ESTJs and  w s  Despite all of this Tiana is a very likeable character and has her sweet side  As a  w  Tiana is very ambitious about her dreams and she works hard to accomplish and be admired for her skills  for what means to her strongly  not exactly for the love of others  except keeping proud her father  ,estj
ESTJ  Answer for those who consider her introverted  Social introversion extroversion is different from that described by cognitive functions  there is nothing social about being Te dom  on the contrary  it is usually a function that leads the person to avoid small talk and to be focused on creating following a plan to achieve a goal  Furthermore  the lower Fi is an obstacle in social interactions because it tends to hide emotions and reserve them only to a few selected people   Te dom   a person who doesn t talk to you because his thinking is goal oriented  Fi inf   a person who does not talk to you because his feelings are reserved  Te dom   Fi inf   a person non introverted  but who avoids you as an introvert would do ,estj
Why    she wasn t achieving anything to be praised for  I believe that hardworking spirit was because of her being an ESTJ rather than being a   She sounded more like an   with   in her triad honestly   ,estj
ESTJ women     chef s kiss ,estj
Can i know why she is an ESTJ  Where can i see the argument  How do I see the arguments of each function that makes it an ESTJ  If she really was an ESTJ  she would be the most attractive princess  BEST GIRL ARGHJJJJSNJSJS but  where are the arguments  Should I look for top comments  I m still having a hard time finding it  there are many comments that are not arguments here  or on other websites ,estj
DUUUDE she s the reason I love ESTJs oml,estj
i love ESTJs sm       she s also a prime example of a healthy sp  ,estj
I lover her and she is definitely an ESTJ,estj
don t see inferior fi   ISTJ makes much more sense,estj
Any unhealthy Fe dom,estj
Kind of surprising that I attract the least xNFPs ,estj
i was gonna say ISTP but i ve been negged and hit on by too many of them     go away,estj
The amount of ESTJ votes lol   With me ESTJs are one of the most attracted types  The least type I attract is an ISFJ and it s quite mutual  Most of them are drama queens followed with unhealthy Fe doms they are so annoying ,estj
Hard to decide when you attract almost nobody  All I know is that it s not xNFJs  The only women who were ever interested in me were xNFJs   Why do I only attract the rarest types    ,estj
no cuz why the hell does mentally ill INFPs keep coming to me instead of very fun xsxps i literally rarely see them,estj
ESXPs  they don t like me   and It s quite mutual  ,estj
I find it weird that the description of this page is  Type you attract least  not type you are attracted to least   Which is I expected on how people talk about the typed they attract the least not typed you hate the most but instead we got bunch of hate comments from any people who doesn t even bother to read the description at all ,estj
ESTP for me  Se doms are annoying as hell they can t sit still  I can t stand them  For me at least ESTJ or the XSTJ are better  because I like their attitudes on efficiency and know just how to do things in the right way which I often times envy their Si,estj
so what ive seen is that most peoples fav type in ENFPs and the most disliked is ESTJs,estj
E  voters please look into self pres      ,estj
What I want to know more than anything is where people are getting  w  from  I can understand Fe to a point but  w   That bewilders me    Twos are defined by their desire to belong and to be loved by others  They are helpful  nurturing and caring towards others  They are eager to involve themselves in others  lives  Twos rarely say no when others ask them for help  and want to prove value to others by always being there for them    This definitely describes Applejack  but wait  there s more   Deepest Fear  Twos fear being alone and unloved  and cope with this fear by taking care of others and making themselves central to other people s lives   Core Motivation  Enneagram Twos want to feel loved and appreciated  which motivates them to express love toward others in their words and actions   Where do people see that her fear is being unloved and desires to be appreciated  Let s see    she values her family  but that s typical for the southern trope  which is what Applejack is based on  and doesn t necessarily equate to    She s motherly    but any type can be motherly  She cares about her friends    so does the rest of the mane     Two s want social approval  they often develop a sense of entitlement because they want what they give to others to be given back to them  If they don t feel needed it crushes them  I don t see any of this in Applejack  and any two traits she has seem to be motivated by her   core  or   core   hence the two wing  Applebuck season off the top of my head is a good example of this   Rainbow Dash  Pinkie Pie  Rarity  and even Fluttershy  which is pushing it  are all much more likely to be a two than Applejack   This isn t even getting into instinctual variants  If a character doesn t fit any instinctual variants of a type they can t be that type    I actually mistyped myself as a two for a while  because I do like giving unconditional love and helping others  but any type can be like that  especially if they re healthy   So again  I ask  where are two voters seeing   core  Or even       as a heart fix  She has both  w  and  w  in her tritype so she DOES have it as a shadow type but that s all it is ,estj
SHE IS MY FAVORITE PONY    I love applejack shes very caring and hard working,estj
Hello again everyone  I m very open to  w  arguments but as of now I am not seeing the core motivations of a  w   I think Applejack is a core   with a   wing  either sp so or so sp  Leaning towards sp so   Self preservation  Anxiety   The Pioneer Either very anxious or self controlled  this subtype channels concerns about survival and security into material achievements as a way to be a good person and do the right thing  It seems important to subdue nature and to impose order on the natural world  Family  home  food preparation  etc  take precedence over other needs  However  too much self sacrifice can fuel physical tension and resentment   Social  Inadaptability   The Social Reformer Comfortable with a secure social role and a clear set of rules  this subtype is usually quite friendly and gregarious on one s own turf  But an emphasis on doing things the right way can make it hard to adapt to new situations  and also can generate resentment or criticism toward others who may be acting  incorrectly  ,estj
if her entire honesty thing is her FI  that I cant see Fe   Fi in her stack  granted  its very close  and inf Fi wouldn t make sense either    I think Te aux makes sense too  she constantly makes decisions based on objective external criteria and wants to speak the concrete truth  she can be very considerate when interacting with her friends  but that might be healthy Te which can look like Fe   she wants to speak her mind  ratting out the fake tonic  the entirety of the  honest apple  episode  wanted to tell Celestia she s a terrible actress  I know there are more examples but I cant recall them right now   basically  Fe follows external data and goes off feeling which is more subjective  while Te is more objective and goes of hard facts  AJ clearly follows what is objectively true which is why I think its healthy Te in the mask of Fe  at least  this is just what I think  if im right about her Fi  then I think ISTJ is more correct ,estj
I would just like to talk to xSTJ voters    Guys no one here is saying that Applejack is ISFJ because she is  empathetic and kind  people are defending her as xSFJ because they see in her someone who cares a lot about interpersonal harmony in a sentimental way  seeking to build social relationships  I see no impersonality  no search for  goals and results   If she is really xSTJ why is she so bad at being impersonal  I don t see the point in it    This argument that  Te dom does this too  doesn t make sense because you basically force concepts of Fe into Te by doing this  no one is saying that Te can t be loving  we are just talking about the function Fe  so stop putting words in the mouths of people you disagree with  it s boring  I don t see impersonality and i don t see her passing over values and feelings because of goals  quite the opposite  Unfortunately I feel that many people here are putting her as xSTJ solely because she is  worker  because when it comes to functions i don t see any Te ,estj
There s an episode that really called my attention  which I don t remember the name  but it was about a difference of ideology between Applejack and Fluttershy over some  fruit bats  or whatever their name was  Fluttershy wanted to see them as friendly companions and wanted to adjust the process of the harvest  or I guess so   to the bats  which happens to her accommodation to other animals and ponies   while Applejack saw them as a hindrance and threat for the process and organization of the harvest aside previous bad experiences  which shows her Te and Si    In some episodes where Applejack becomes stubborn about receiving help in the harvest it clearly seems like an inferior introverted judgmental function  Fi Ti   which I lean towards Fi    Honestly I don t get the ISFJ opinion  or less  a weird rising ISTJ opinion that happened some months ago  I don t get how are you guys seeing inf Ne   She had a relatively good to bad use of Ne  but it grew naturally as she matured  and after y know learning the friendship thing stuff  But her Fi gave her problems ,estj
Please don t be rude to me  but I believe Applejack is an ISFJ  she values standards and impressions of the past more than objectivity  I don t think she s an impersonal character who ignores her own feelings   There is no point in   She is Te user because is hardworking   since she s not a character who keeps denying her feelings and values  things ESTJs do   She doesn t focus on external events and goals  Applejack clearly chooses to use cultural  social values  Fe  and patterns  Si  rather than facts and external reasoning  At what point does she ignore her own feelings for objective things   She doesn t  Being   worker   doesn t mean be Te user  In season   s ep     when she visits Pinkie s family  instead of trying to understand the external events and structure of Pinkie s family  she relies on her impressions and patterns of the past  Si  and from them  tries to make the event in this family s home to be familiar and to resemble the impressions of the past she have    Si  Introverted Feeling  Dominant   Applejack is a character extremely guided by a dominant Si  almost everything she does and follows is based on her strong impressions of the past  she is a detail oriented character who in several episodes tends to notice small changes compared to past experiences   An example of dominant Si lower Ne can be perfectly seen in episode    of season    when Applejack  visiting Pinkie Pie s family  is extremely anxious and uncomfortable to see that he was in a new and unusual situation for her  Applejack is uncomfortable seeing that they did things in a totally different way than she believes and is used to  In several episodes Applejack shows anxiety and difficulty in decision making because it doesn t count on several other possibilities of events  In addition to her having a very internal view  Si  of how things work  I see a lot more focus on internal patterns and subjective impressions of the past than on objectivity  I believe many here are putting her high just because she s a worker  since she doesn t have the characteristics of Te   Fe  Extroverted Feeling  Auxiliary    Applejack values social values in a very personal way  she always seeks to apply social values to maintain harmony and interpersonal interactions  Applejack values and cares a lot about interpersonal harmony  and social values in a PERSONAL way  she is a character who gives constant attention to the needs of her friends and family  often failing to do things she wanted needed to do in order to comply with the social  Even putting their needs and feelings of others above hers   People put her as Te user because she likes to do things well and is hardworking  but it s so much simplistic    It s no use for her to be a worker since    she doesn t overlook her own feelings  she s not impersonal and she has no impersonal pursuit of goals   In addition to doing everything to look for social harmony  Applejack always uses his interpersonal skills to emotionally help people who are sad Applejack channels people s feelings to help them   Fe   Examples of Fe in Episodes   Season   and ep    when Applejack tells the Apples to keep social harmony so Pinkie will think they are a perfect family   Season   and ep    When Applejack decides to do favors for everyone  putting the need for social above herself   Season   and ep    Plus  all her interactions with her younger sister Applebloom and her best friend Pinkie Pie show a lot of the character s high extroverted feeling    Ti  Introverted Thinking  Tertiary    This is the deductive side of Applejack  that stubborn side that is always trying to solve problems with its own thought process  that s exactly why there s no way Applejack can be ESTJ or ISTJ  she has Ti  and it s a very apparent Ti  and sometimes childish     As ISFJs are so uniquely focused on developing their inner maps of experiential impressions and defining their directions in life based on the kinds of experiences these maps point to them  at some point in life it turns out that they must start making the question  What if the map is wrong    Applejack s Ti primarily serves as a reminder that your experiences  values and impressions don t always directly correspond to the most universally simple or reasonable approach  Applejack has a preference for what came to define her comfort zone  She doesn t like surprises  she wants complete information and wants time to sort all the information filled in  basically a Si Ti combo    Ne inferior   Another reason I can t see Applejack as ESTJ  apart from the lack of lower Fi  is that I think her Ne is too bad and paranoid to be tertiary  I don t see any focus on exploring possibilities  in several episodes  Applejack gets lost or anxious about multiple possibilities and unpredictability and ends up having difficulty making decisions because of not having other possibilities and events ,estj
Why are people saying xSFJ  She is ESTJ  Just because she cares about other people and doesn t fit the jerk Te dom stereotype doesn t make her a Fe dom ,estj
I m rusty on the show but I just don t see Fe  One thing I remember is that sometimes she s so stubborn she won t listen to her friends and family when she s dead set on accomplishing her goals  I feel like an Fe user would take their friends feelings into account more  and stop so they don t worry so much  Again  might be misremembering here,estj
Why not ISTJ  Her Si is soooo much all over the place  Maybe less when she gets older but I still see Fi and Si stronger than Te ,estj
Even the mbti test said that ,estj

Extraverted types   Minds outwardly directed  interest and attention following objective happenings  primarily of those in the immediate environment  Their real world is the outer world of people and things   Introverted types   Minds inwardly directed  frequently unaware of the objective environment  interest and attention being engrossed by inner events  Their real world is therefore the inner world of ideas and possibilities     I personally think Hermione is the former  so ISTJ voters  please elucidate and evaluate your thoughts ,estj
the way she always helps other but ignores her own psychical needs  best example  the whole  rd year  makes her so LVEF   LVFE,estj
I was going to vote ISTJ but I just remembered how her intuition isn t that bad for being inferior  on the last movies when she s reading to find a way and all of that she s having a lot of random insights based on what she reads and how the lecture afects her  Si Ne   An ISTJ wouldn t have these insights  not like that ,estj
Can somebody explain SCOEN so I can type her properly  I m still not sure yet but I always think she s a SLOAN or SLOEN because she always reacts in stressful situations and she s always there to help other characters when they need a hand  She s also very moralistic and she fights for her beliefs  She s very responsible yet strict  but is also very loyal  I m not gonna vote yet because I might be wrong   However  I can agree with Non Curious   Inquisitive  She always trusts traditions and how they re done before but don t usually trust new methods because she trusts logic more  She is very levelheaded and practical  Not because she s a bookworm  driven  organized or because she likes learning education  that would mean she s automatically an Inquisitive type    Description about her from the net    Hermione was noted for being both extremely intellectual curious and very hard working  coming out on top in most of her classes and continuously aiding Harry and Ron in their adventures  She was so studious that the Ministry allowed her a Time Turner in her third year  a device that rewinds time so that she could take extra courses      Because of her efficiency and compassion  Hermione often had time to do hobby work on the side  such as preparing a defence for Buckbeak to save him from execution and creating S P E W   an organisation promoting the freedom of house elves      Such acts demonstrated her social conscience and tenacity     According to the net  here s a difference between SCOEN AND SLOEN  I still cannot decide between the two     Committed to self improvement  discipline  and hard work  the Soldier is a leader and a problem solver  You are reliable  traditional  and loyal  and know that things would go more smoothly if more people just did what you say     Decisive  hard working  and organized  the Supervisor has a clear sense of right and wrong  a commitment to regulations  and a strong sense of discipline  However  you are governed by your emotions as much as by your rationality  so you can find yourself angry or hurt when people and situations don t follow the rules  ,estj
Hermione in the movies is far more extroverted in the movies than in the books  She absolutely dominates the trio s plans and strategy meetings  She comes off as controlling by advising Harry and Ron to follow through with her plans and to not screw up  Te is stronger than Si  When Hermione first introduces herself to Harry and Ron  she fixes Harry s glasses and tells Ron that he has dirt on his nose  She is brutally honest  She shows a lot of initiative  In Movie    Hermione coaches Ron on the levitating charm step by step and tells him exactly what he is doing wrong and to watch her example  Hermione soon burns Snape s jacket with a fire charm to save Harry from his jinxed broomstick  She later brews a Polyjuice potion  which takes about a month of intricate steps  to prepare for an infiltration into the Skytherin dorms at night later on in the year  In Movie    Hermione researches basilisks and makes sure she has parts of her research in her hands so that Harry and Ron take over her work when she expects to be petrified by the snake for being a Muggle born  In Movie    Hermione willingly threatens Malloy for insulting her  She also uses the Time Turner in the same film   Hermione also started to research werewolves when she noticed Snape abruptly taught them at a certain point in the year when they should have learned about them later based on the curriculum  She makes it immediately known to Harry and Ron that Lupin is one when he shows signs  In Movie    Hermione aligned herself with Victor Krum for the connections in the wizarding world she would inevitably get out of him due to his popularity and competence  When Harry cheats in potions by using Snape s abandoned revised textbook in Movie    she immediately snaps at him for not following the guidelines   Si comes next  Hermione is a literal textbook  often studying concepts and magic disciplines far in advance  When Hermione saw a discrepancy in Snape s lesson plan  she investigated the cause  Ron even states that Hermione follows a set routine of researching at the library to solve complex problems  When she discovered the symptoms of petrification  she researched to discover the cause  Hermione can point out details such as Harry having broken glasses  Hermione expresses jubilance when her love potion smelled like toothpaste  since her parents are dentists  and freshly mown grass from her home   All the same  she is very skeptical of unproven and ambiguous disciplines of magic such as divination  believing Trelawney to be a fraud  She fails to consider possibilities like an intuitive would  She didn t think there were thestrals that rode the passengers aboard to Hogwarts  believing instead the horse cart was enchanted  Hermione refuses to believe the deathly hallows actually exist without evidence  Hermione butts heads with Luna due to the latter s Ne and often dismisses Luna s assertions of things that she cannot prove exists as nonsense   And finally  Hermione accepts everything at face value  Ni dom Snape investigated more efficient ways to brew potions during his time as a student  Never once with all of her talent and intelligence did she bother to question the logic presented to her  She never innovated or experimented with magic  She followed the guidelines and research others have done before her  She is good at doing what she is told  That is why she has Si and not Ni ,estj
OH YEAH ANNOYING   BUT IN BOOK SHE IS MORE LIKE XSTJ,estj
Hermione is more ESTJ than ISTJ because in the movie she imposes herself more in social situations than in books  that she becomes more secluded  I think her is a stereotype of ESTJ person,estj
Hahahahaha Pam Beesly,estj
Bruh  why ESTJ over any of the Se users   ENTJ  ESTP and ESFP s are overall more aggressive,estj
I think this thread could greatly benefit from a clearer and more functional definition of aggression,estj
Not only this profile  many people often mistake sx so   as the most aggressive variant   Perhaps it is because both of those instincts have extroverted energy   However  Social   is the most altruistic and friendly variant of all   instinctive variants  And sx sp will show a much more aggressive tendency with the combination of the aggression of the Sexual   and the boundary of the sp  ,estj
When i think of ESTJs  i see hippopotamus  Is that normal ,estj
The only thing I can think of when I think of ESTJs is aggressive,estj
Well  physical aggression or verbal aggression  Or any other type of aggression  Without a clear distinction  then many types can take the cake  I will base this on more external descriptions of aggression  which would probably be extroverted    ENTJ   Te Se ESTJ   Te Ne ENFJ   Fe Se ESFJ   Fe Ne ESTP   Se Fe ENTP   Ne Fe ESFP   Se Te ENFP   Ne Te  Physical aggression would likely have Se  Se is about grounded possibilities that are rooted in Ni   Verbal aggression would likely have Ne  Ne is about abstract possibilities that are rooted in Si   I would favor physical aggression since it is more likely to hurt the body  not only the mind   If you favor verbal aggression  then you can take my argument that way   So here are the new contestants   ENTJ   Te Se ENFJ   Fe Se ESTP   Se Fe ESFP   Se Te  Aggression rooted in the disruption of surrounding borrowed values would be ENFJ ESTP  Aggression rooted in the disruption of surrounding borrowed logic would be ENTJ ESFP   I am pushed to yet another opinion  which I would say   well   let s narrow this down a bit more  Te Fe would be more aggressive since they would easily be able to detect these changes over a tertiary   So  ENTJ vs ENFJ   Well  ENTJs are more likely to be type  s  and ENFJs are more likely to be type  s   Type  s are probably more prone to physical aggression  so I guess ENTJ   If you preferred verbal aggression  then ESTJ ,estj
Aggressive  Oxford     Ready or likely to attack or confront  characterized by or resulting from aggression    Pursuing one s aims and interests forcefully  sometimes unduly so  Merriam Webster     A forceful action or procedure  such as an unprovoked attack  especially when intended to dominate or master    Hostile  injurious  or destructive behavior or outlook especially when caused by frustration  I m not for the ESTJ consensus because Si and Ne is cautious by nature and less reactive or responsive to present stimuli  Se and Ni is the opposite because of its focus on the moment and focusing on it in the present than in the future when it becomes irrelevant  Personally  I do not agree with the ESTP consensus either because the Ti Fe axis is more detached from self which goes against the  when caused by frustration  part of Webster s definition  if anything  it is more Fi Te  Personally  I think that a ESTP is more willing to manipulate or smooth talk their way to achieve their interests because of their Fe concern about how their message might come across  seeing people as extensions of themselves  and other factors which goes against the  forceful  aspect of aggressive in both definitions    Furthermore  the Te and Fi axis is more oriented toward personal goals and interests rather than something impersonal and oriented toward  a greater social impact   I d remove high Fi users from aggressive because they champion inner ideals more than fulfilling them due to their repressed Te and their dominant Fi  This goes against Oxford s definition which includes  pursuing one s aims and interests forcefully   For me  it is between ESFP and ENTJ  ENTJs have inferior Fi which is the opposite of high Fi s strong control over their feelings  sometimes it is so strong Fi users may seem cold and unfeeling to others and be mistaken as thinkers  and the willingness of Fi to apply the golden rule  However  at the same time  ENTJs can be very detached from their feelings due to repressing their Fi which goes against the  especially when caused by frustration  portion of Webster s definition  Either way  I am stuck between ENTJ and ESFP   ,estj
How is ESTJ aggressive its just talk lol,estj
Let s remember some things from my life  I attacked my parents several times  My sister  My grandparents  literally all the Teachers I had in my life  school principals  Fights at school were routine  I once took a colleague s head and kept hitting it on the wall  I irritate with extreme ease  And I say a lot of bad words ,estj
They gave ME alot of trauma  My mother ppl around ME etc they both tried to dominate me by gaslighting me n my ideas even tho our ideas quiet similar  Yeah and oh ESTJ  w s too    ts just my experience  For ESTPs   think theyre ok but gave me trouble when   was president  student council    had to warn them alot   Im not disagreeable person nor   like pushing my ideals into someone even i know they ll get hurt in the end   I ll just telll them no More    personally dont like people Who blindly follow me tbh   ts not that   cant stand ESTJs   can toleratee ppl but sometimes its too draining,estj
oh my freaking god i hate her so freakingmuch she was the worst person i have ever met and put me through so much because of her toxicity ,estj
She was depressive asf and nothing could make her happy  I became friends with her because i felt bad but then she had started to manipulating me and said       like  so you are leaving me alone too   i thought you were a good friend  when i didnt talk with her about only two weeks  She was also very insufferable  i never could be happy with her anyway because she was always sad and only venting me non stop  I tried to cheer her up but it never worked  i know her situation is sad but im not her therapist or something so i had to drop her for my own mental health,estj
Pretty sure my toxic ex friend was an ESFP  albeit an extremely unhealthy one  It was an extremely emotional mentally abusive relationship but sadly I just couldn t get away even though I had so many chances  Not someone I ever want to associate with again  Once they were gone I was finally able to learn who my real friends were and actually help myself for once  Such a shame cause in theory I actually quite like ESFP s ,estj
I won t even mention who this is  This guy has and always will be in my mind  like how Oceanians in      felt about Big Brother ,estj
I cannot STAND discussions with ENTP  s  Especially the unhealthy ones  Ti users stay far away from me when you want to argue with someone ,estj
Normally  I love INFJs  but the guy who destroyed my friendship with probably the best friend I ever had and ruined my mental health was a manipulative  narcissistic psychopath who also happened to be an INFJ in Se grip  All types can be nasty when they want to be  and INFJs are no exception ,estj
Not ironically  this is the MOST hateful combo of MBTI and Enneagram types possible  at least for me  ,estj
ill list some that i have personally experienced  but let me remind you that not all of them are bad  im sure there s better ones out there so    INTJs are usually cynical bastards with tunnel vision and think that staying lowkey for the rest of their life is gonna fix their social issues  insecurities  and personal trauma    ISFJs are very judgemental and usually have zero idea on what theyre talking about which makes them assholes    ESTPs are either those cringe frat kids in high school that were known for getting poon or theyre the more fun having guy that doesnt care about life    INFPs are sometimes the most unbelievably delusional idiots that has ever walked on this world    ENFPs are the most unbelievably annoying and ditzy idiots that cant tell whether they love or like someone and it drives me mad trying to guess    ENTPs are usually edgelords that can get really pissy and act like theyre always right when everyone else knows that theyre not    ISTPs are either cold as      and have zero ambitions and some of them piss me off really bad,estj
which is fun because i like ISFJ s  who doesn t,estj
He is the person that you will mistakenly think is an   if you don t know enneagram that much and only vote based on some videos he s getting angry  He s more than that videos ,estj
Let me make it clear that I know barely anything about Gordon Ramsey  Let me also note that I know many ESFJs and ESTJs who are pretty anti traditional  The connection of of both their dominant functions and Ne functions being extraverted make them very open minded  ESTJs analyze the possible outcomes and possibilities of things  and then organize their external environment to prevent problems from happening  This then goes into the routine and structure part of their environment  they will then keep their environment how it is from that point forward  and can become distressed when it changes  It s what makes ENTJs seem more calm and collected when compared to ESTJs   their Se tert causes them to become more adaptable to their environments which also causes them to organize their environment less according to the  what ifs  and more to the  here and now   Not to say ESTJs can be very relaxed and easy going people  I say this so that people can become more understanding of their differences  Too many people look for Dominant and Auxiliary functions in others rather than the connection of their Dominant and Tertiary function ,estj
ramsay is all about classic  no frills cooking  he denounces most things non traditional  deeming them pretentious  it s      and he still can t get behind veganism  there are numerous tiktoks   tweets in which he ll poke fun at vegan dishes   just have some steak    he s not as open minded  ESTJ s get a lot of undeserving flack here   they re actually very loving  protective and head strong  stop the intuitive bias madness,estj
I think ESTJ would probably make everything from books  I mean  people who are obsessed with tradition will never change the classic French recipes or experiment with ingredients or travel around the world to find new ones  Just imagine ESTJ  chef in his family restaurant  who is changing menu that was held at this restaurant from his grandfather  I always type real people by their work  and Gordon       Te dom  has more Ni vision about new foods ,estj

silly pdb ESTJs cant be sx ,estj
Gordon Ramsay is LSE  Why because he s ESTJ  His style of leadership is far more authoritative and demanding than what you would expect from a Delta type    He will immediately insult the chefs when they aren t doing their job well  He puts pressure on anyone that s working for him to become the best of the best  Se valuing   He s extremely picky with food and will criticize any food that doesn t coincide with his own logical  precise preferences and will clearly praise if it s done otherwise  Ti valuing   He has his own understanding of what his food should be like and whether the food is perfectly done or not according to him  he ll quickly point it to you  Ti Se ego     These are clearly Beta ST values  Delta ST is far more pragmatic and laid back with what they demand from others  Just because he likes food  doesn t mean he s Si valuing  He likes food because it s a source of ambition to him  Se valuing   Food gives him the tools to help every cook and or chef out there to achieve the goals that benefit their future  Se Ni valuing   While he s calmer outside his TV shows  he still values the very high demands and expectations he brings to the people he s had to work with  Se Ti Fe valuing   because he wants them to succeed   I m leaning SLE  While I can understand the LSI votes and they re far more reasonable than the LSE ones  his Fe is far more bold and expressive than what you would expect from an LSI  There s literally also an analysis video on YouTube with him being SLE ,estj
People can t get over the hump in understanding that a genius making use of his Se is not Si  Ni is very obvious in Gordon s speech patterns ,estj
why SLOEN instead of SLUEN  ,estj
I only started watching  but her Fi is already clear to me  The way she does what s illogical to save the boy  the way she says she has to stay true to herself  No way that is inf Fi ,estj
Can explain the Te and Si  It seems to me that Nobara is written as a daring  sensory  perceptive  improvisist  impulsive and action person  Se   Although I see similarities with Misaka Mikoto and Asuka  I do not see in Kugisaki the needs of control  dominance  and desires to impose on other people  Te   She prefers to live at the moment  and enjoy the emotions and sensory experiences  Se   As for the argument of Fi  the ESTPs can develop ideals and stay faithful to their own codes  as well as the types that value Fi  I do not see Nobara as Te Dom  and I never show Si  at least for what was shown in the anime  ,estj
Very clear FVLE   F flippancy  confidence  and results oriented dialogue ,estj
Nobara is CLEARLY a  F  It s a pivotal part of her character  Unconcerned emotion is also obvious  She s a  V    not a  V  We can see this through her relationships with her peers  Although she s very competitive with them she very clearly wants to work with them to grow as a sorcerer  This is especially clear with Maki  She s a  L   bc she s never shown to put any energy towards logic  and frankly insecure is the last spot open ,estj
How is she VFLE  Like actually how tf is she typed  F,estj
why is she VFLE over FVLE ,estj

Welcome to PDB  where cool and likeable ESTJs are plagued with brainless ESTP and ENTJ arguments,estj
can you guys explain why is she an inferior Fi ,estj
This guy is the only person i can deadass say i would pick the exact opposite typology for by face,estj
Okay  I will explain why he s LIE and this has nothing to do with what I typed him as in MBTI so please don t even respond to this thread mentioning anything about MBTI   What he exhibits a ton of  above all is what I ll call  logic fluidity   While he may reference some core principles  his main strength in his debates is looking outward and reacting to the information thrown to him quickly using the most efficient retort  He is not so much intent to spread a specific kind of  conservatism  or whatever  as he is to win the game  Which is why he doesn t spend a ton of time breaking apart contradictions or making abstract references to try to bring people exactly to his way of thinking  I think you can compare him to Jordan Peterson who is probably LSI   His political philosophy when it does come out is more of this pragmatic capitalism concept which is much easier to defend in a debate  even if it lacks much internal consistency or a real  core   Which also ties in very strongly to the Gamma quadra which is known to be capitalistic in a sort of libertarian democratic way  But I think overall it s pretty clear that he s more reactive to what comes his way than prescriptive based on Ti ideal structures and such   I m pretty sure people are voting LSE just because they see him as ESTJ because on its face I don t really see any good arguments for saying he s LSE over LIE  other than maybe that he s strong at cataloguing and referencing factual information  However that is Te in general in socionics  and we can see his love for confrontation and close mindedness to a lot of perspectives is not Si Ne valuing  And he s been a very savvy businessman  mainly presenting what people want to hear which is more in line with  democracy  Gamma politics and attitude   Also if you really want to see his logic fluidity and Ti ignoring  there s a lot of juxtapositions of things he tweeted or said one day versus another day and he can be hilariously inconsistent because he is more focused on making the most efficient argument that s easy to pick up by the average idiot  However if you really see him as a   rather than a    I can understand voting him LSI as well  but I think that s a misinterpretation of the true BS   I already mentioned before  but watch Jordan Peterson for an LSI example  For LSE  watch David Pakman s call in segments for an LSE example  He tries to minimize controversy by throwing undeniable facts at people and then working together with them even if they re misinformed  while showing respect for their perspective ,estj
I went and watched his personality type video and listened to his explanations and the way he reacted to each question    I saw a trend of him agreeing heavily with future thinking  he takes his time with decisions and rarely feels regret  and interpreting the message of things  the meaning of a song movie  philosophical discussion  etc   On the other hand he doesn t relate as much to thinking of unrealistic ideas  Definitely more of a Ni user than Ne  Could not imagine him being an ESTJ  somebody who has difficulty with thinking far ahead   His introversion shows big time  He rarely takes the lead in conversation  prefers spending time alone  and has an aversion to parties  Even if this is more behavioral  an extravert would not respond the way he did about the questions asking whether he appreciates alone time over spending time with others  one of the more neutral questions in mbti     He has said he s not a detail oriented person and neither does he plan things out to the finest detail  I doubt he has strong Si   He s actually surprisingly honest about his capacity to stay calm  He s a bit contradictory on this later but before he started to speed through the test he agreed that one could upset him  although it wouldn t necessarily be easy  You d think the guy who is facts over feelings would staunchly disagree with the question  this might have to do with his tertiary Fi  Where he can get upset if he feels he s not being treated properly  and he seldom cares about if he disturbs the harmony in doing so  just think of the interview he walked out on     I think INTJ is a valid shot  Also  feelings   facts    ,estj
I think his slogan says it all    Facts  Te  don t care about your feelings  Fi inferior  ,estj

There s no way this man is LSE  Forget the ESTJ vs ENTJ debate for a second  how is this guy utilitarian at all  He s a man of precise information and getting his facts straight before he destroys his opposition and teaches people information  He s extremely focused on the validity of information and its application in the real world  The reasons he s so close minded about the leftist agenda and the stuff leftists say is because they re not based on logical arguments and or science that s been proven  He leads in socio Ti for sure  He constantly applies his knowledge to the masses and isn t afraid to be rude disrespectful to people when he feels that they don t deserve it  Socio Fe  The guy has none of it  He doesn t care about social relations and playing off of emotional atmospheres as much as any LSE LIE would  He gets his point across and he doesn t care who he upsets while doing it  Facts don t care about your feelings after all  and that sort of statement is the kind of harsh but  necessary  way LSI s get information out to people  He snaps back in arguments quickly with that creative Se of his  He isn t afraid to overtake others during debates in order to get his point across no matter what you think of it  His role Fi is what prevents him from being too insensitive because he can definitely understand the emotions of others  but he usually uses those feelings to further support his arguments based around logical facts  I think the most obvious thing besides his leading Ti is his PoLR Ne  The guy literally hates the left because of how  progressive  it is  He always complains about how the new things the left comes up with are unnecessary and stupid  He doesn t like ideas that are too wild or out of the norm  not saying that this is because he s a conservative though  he s naturally like this   He definitely enjoys innovative new ways to go about things  but he doesn t like the changes to society because of how drastically different it is from what society used to be back then   I tried to be as objective as possible with this argument and tried not to sound politically biased  I am a conservative republican like Ben   so I apologize if I do  I don t mean to sound biased in any sort of way  I m just trying to argue ,estj
It s official  Ben Shapiro s Tritype with the incorporation of Wings is  w   w   w  ,estj
A lot of ppl here and in general on pdb have to learn how to give objective comments  You commenting  cringe  etc only shows how immature you are and incapable of objectivity  And it s interesting how especially ppl who pretend to be xNTx are always giving heavenly biased comments   This is a page solely there for typing  if you want to gossip go to Reddit or to off topic boards  but the comment section is for objectivity only   As for his type I agree with the consensus  obviously strong Te and bound to traditions Si ,estj
lets say hypothetically  i m an ISTJ,estj
HE S NOT A THREE  Social self pres    This type appears One like also  but for different reasons  This time  the social instinct combines with the self pres to give this subtype a strong desire to know where they fit within the group  with whom they can make strong alliances  Conversely  they can counterphobically oppose groups  They are usually political in some form  Adhering to rules is seen as very important to this type  They have issues with authority  such as distrusting reactively or trusting too vehemently  This is the result of their lack of a close connection to people  a function of the undeveloped sexual instinct   Their allegiance is not to individuals but to a group of like minded others  This subtype could possibly find themselves in jobs such as with the police of firefighting force  and in such professions where it is possible to identify with a group which has clearly defined rules and purposes  On the up side  these are people with a strong moral compass  they can be counted on to do the right thing  They do volunteer work  They become politicians  They are generally solid people  On the down side  their  us against them  thinking can turn into bigotry  paranoia  and  playing the martyr     In relationships  they can appear almost Two like sometimes  Their need for people in their lives  coupled with the sexual instinct being last  causes them to worry about the close bonds they have with others and can also cause them to  go towards  while at the same time requiring validation about the strength of the bond  On the down side  they can become very critical of others when they fear their differences  Their need to find security within the group is threatened when others don t do things the way they do or think the way they think  This occurs mostly when this subtype is unhealthy     repost cuz it got buried  ,estj
why are people voting ESTP  just because he was a bully doesn t mean he s a se dom and where s fe  his lack of fe is pretty obvious,estj
ESTJ cannot be an EIE y all   Fe base is theatrical  dramatic and expressive  They re cunning and calculated but can be prone to bouts of indecisiveness  ESTJs are Te dominant types  Fi inferior makes them unlikely to be theatrical or dramatic in presentation and makes their life approach very objective and lawful as opposed to the wild energy that radiates from EIE s ,estj
Not PDB typing every villain as an EIE or Beta   I ve been on verge as for whether he is an ESE SEE  thus decided to take a look at the quadra values more for it  since he never strikes me as an Fe valuers in a way    The individual feels at home among people who are actively doing something and interacting with each other directly  visibly   and is able to organize people  move them around as necessary  and guide them in achieving a specific goal  He or she likes obedience and even subservience in others  since it allows him to  make things happen  more effectively     He is keenly aware of territorial conflicts and confrontational behavior occurring around him  He very quickly becomes confrontational when others try to make him move or get him to do something in an aggressive or confrontational way  He quickly recognizes when people are trying to get each other to do something or are trying to organize him for some purpose  He also spontaneously uses aggression to achieve his own goals     The individual is very adept at perceiving  establishing  and maintaining personal bonds between people  However  these bonds are often perceived as being situational and flexible rather than static  The individual is inclined to focus on establishing personal bonds with other people in the context of realizing or following perceptions from his base function     The person easily creates a sense of closeness and kinship between people by expressing like and acceptance  but these sentiments are situational rather than an expression of permanent feelings  If the person s mood or external situation changes  he or she may  turn off  the feelings instantly  even forgetting whom they had created the feeling of kinship with    If you ever have remembered when he deliberately praised Harry Potter before he soon realized that he joined  in his opinion  a wrong friendship relationship  I sensed the high usage of Fi in the ego  as in  he is aware of what  friendship  looks like  constantly assessing the importance of it thus not giving up towards the concept of it  As for the Se ego  that might also be self explanatory for his tendency to constantly become the leader of his  friends  in benefit  while trying to do anything  no matter what the rules take  which might expose his inability in discerning the laws or regulations of school to be abided by himself  Ni suggestive seems to be obvious  despite not having an ability to know what he should be aware of  he apparently was giving a signal that he needed to be aware of the hidden patterns or connections between one or two things that he has perceived  in a way    He may be able to express his views clearly when given the time  but he is not prepared to deal with people who challenge his views and draw him into logical arguments and disputes  For this reason  he is reluctant to publicize new determinations and opinions until he is absolutely sure that they are right and that he can support them thoroughly to anyone who challenges them     The individual is attracted to people who are confident in their ability to evaluate where present trends are leading and to choose the opportune moment to initiate action  or to refrain from it  The individual is impulsive but at the same time desiring of not going too far in his impulsiveness and unsure of his own ability in this area  so people who are confident on how far to go and when to stop are admired and their company is desired  The individual also longs for a sense of greater meaning in his life beyond the immediately physical and enjoys the company of people who can show him the light in that area    A good example of LSE is Hermione  constantly thinking about the evaluatory implication of logic to be extenuated according to the coherent procedure and external experience of logic  and it s pretty much the pragmatism which being showed by her  As for the subtype  I could see Se subtype better for Draco ,estj
Isn t the featured quote from the books ,estj
The Se Ni usage is pretty much obvious in Draco   He is abrasive plus scans through things to find what is useful  As for judging  he uses fi te,estj
I thought he was INTJ  but I m leaning towards ESTP rn  Draco is poorly developed in the movies and therefore really hard to type  but I just want to have a chat with the INFP voters ,estj
It s been a long time since I ve watched this but he just kinda look like your typical ESFP mf  I dun think he s an IJ or IP   Impulsive Se   direct when expressing Se Ni   can t imagine him being on the Ti Fe axis  And EJ will be more planned and structured  but he s not like that  he just acts like he has a plan but actually hmmmm  But of course I could be wrong this is just my impression hahahah,estj
only thing i m sure of is that he is an fi user,estj
okay so i voted for ESTP because i saw the Se dom in him but i completely forgot ESTPs use Ti  sorry about that  draco doesn t use any Ti whatsoever but he s definitely not Te dom either  so i ve come to the conclusion that he s not well written enough as a character to be typed  seriously  what s his personality  he obeys his father without hesitation and bullies everyone else  he seeks admiration but that can be explained with his enneagram core    he thinks he s superior to everyone and that s it  a stereotypical bully  people vote him as ESTJ ESTP because of that which is simply ridiculous  i cant even tell what his morals are therefore i can t say if he stands up to them   so yeah i m open to hearing any arguments,estj
Regina intuitive   What ,estj
I just don t see the line to    I don t see her becoming a dead eyed and numb conformist when it gets stressful  I see her disintegrating into   to cope with stress  Maybe that s her strong   fix but yeah  Never got core   vibes  Got very unhealthy soc  vibes    EDIT   EXPLANATION  Disintegrated  s are terrifying as Patrick Bateman  Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell show us  but their behaviour is characterised by numbness  doing extreme antisocial      in an attempt to feel something  Like   they are numb  Disintegrated  s do not lash out at people directly  with the direct intent of revenge  as disintegrating  s do   This is   vs       vs     the   s expression of anger attempts to be indirect and the   also denies that the anger is there  meaning disintegrated  s won t be directly vengeful bc they are trying to deny and avoid anger  the    or the disintegrated    is embracing of anger and so it is directly vengeful  When Regina was rejected by Cady  her girls  and the school  she became directly vengeful with her whole Burn Book scheme ,estj
Regina doesn t hold   as her core in the slightest guys what s going on here      This girl is NOT an     s can easily be power hungry  when that ambition becomes unhealthy a   can be incredibly manipulative  Regina is the farthest thing from an    she isn t blunt  or have any strong morals she stands by  She isn t an   in the slightest  She isn t open about people she hate  and a huge   thing is that they don t care how others percieve them  and that s a huge difference between   and    She doesn t outwardly try to assert dominance  instead taking the subtle  unidentifiable approach  She SCREAMS unhealthy   the   votes feel very out of place to me ,estj
Regina is a stereotype of ESTJ  w  Choleric  I don t imagine her with another type  temperamental and enneagram,estj
I think the way she manipulates others  knowing exactly how they ll react  seems much more like an use of Ni than Si  to me ,estj
Gregarious and very assertive  Not especially self conscious or prone to depression  Demonstrates a certain degree of self belief and orderliness  e g  attention to detail regarding her appearance   Suspicious  dishonest  self centered  arrogant and unsympathetic  Poor self awareness  No indication of intellectualism  in fact I think she demonstrates some anti intellectual behaviour in some scenes  By far her standout trait is extremely low agreeableness ,estj
Can anyone explain the Te Fi axis  She s highly aware of her emotional surroundings in an environment and capitalizes on it  with ease  she finds out the motivations  fears  and desires of anyone she wishes via flattery and the right word choice  and is highly manipulative of others emotions  She also is very quick to play the victim and she s really good at pretending to be empathetic and tugging on the emotional heart strings of those around her  She s clearly an unhealthy Fe dom  I haven t seen a moment where Regina tried to apply anything to societally held truths  people are just voting Te dom due to ESTJ mean girl stereotypes ,estj
Los ENTJ no pueden ver a un ESTJ que no caiga en el estereotipo de la maestra rega ona  que terminan creyendo que a ley es de su misma tipolog a lol,estj
how is she  w  can someone explain ,estj
Not  s for me  at least you see them coming  Threes and even sixes and some fives can be worse ,estj
And  w  s too unhealthy   s and fes,estj
For the ENTPs you can never ever win a debate or a conversation with them  I found them to be quite stubborn with their own opinion and they will always like to proof you wrong even      they are wrong   And also what s more annoying is that they will always want to proof they are right even if they are wrong and they often won  And because they are so unpredictable I found this trait very scary,estj
Same guy ,estj
My biggest fear is    ESTJs,estj
you guys are really cool and i usually admire you  but you are intimidating haha,estj
they are so cool but very intimidating lol,estj
there s just smth about them  ,estj
I call ENFJ  s the serial killer type because they always give me that vibe,estj
ESFJs scare me to death  Outwardly sweet and infallible  but will make fun of you behind your back and will be possessive when you break with them  Maybe I don t know any healthy ESFJs  but I ve met lots of them and all of them have been like this ,estj
                                                            ,estp
Where are you guys getting Ti from  he s way too Fi driven to be an ESTP ,estp
Can someone explain how this character is Ti  I don t remember him caring at all about logical consistency  understanding how things work as a whole or the value of deductive reasoning   The vast majority of these comments talk about how he either lacks Fi or displays more Fe than Fi   and therefore  this is why he is Ti  Since I can find many holes in these explanations  I would really love to see a strong argument focusing purely on his Ti ,estp
he is an ESTP icon change my mind,estp
if fi blind was a person it would be denji,estp
Man  Denji has turned into one of my favorite ESTPs in fiction  He is oddly realistic  considering all the bullcrap he had to live through   I so think his Se is stronger than his Ti  I cannot see him as Fe inf  when his Ni  is  inferior ,estp
The appearance of him suffering from debt and finding happiness in reality while suffering from various hardships in the beginning is too Se dom  Se users show a very strong appearance about life ,estp
Whats his moral alignment  Ill probably think its Chaotic Good,estp
can someone explain  w   ,estp
que bom que a era de digitar a nanno como INTJ acabou,estp
For INTJ voter  you re not entirely wrong  Nanno is INTJ  w  in real life  Correct me if I m wrong   ,estp
Tritype argument   It s more likely that she has sx   instead of other sx because she knows others  needs well  but instead of using that to help  she uses it to do her job   My tritype is      The strength of my   and   dominates    but I can readily deploy   if it s needed  What makes it a part of my tritype is because it s a natural skill  not learned   As for Nanno  we don t know if her   is natural or learned but it s more likely to be natural because she s quick to pick up human behaviour patterns  Plus  she already has immortality  so how surprising could it get if she has a skill that can be learned by humans ,estp
i truly don t understand her AP and can t type her  can anyone explain ,estp
tbh i think she has   rather than   in her tritype  while it is hard to type her  i don t think she cares much abt her image in a typical way a   would but she can manipulate and construct it however she chooses to get her desired result  and very very rarely ever lets any true emotion or feelings slip  i d even go as far as saying she rejects any of her own individuality that she may possess by taking on a different persona or saying specific things to manipulate whomever shes with    s focus on external rather than internal  and have a need to be liked  i think that sounds more like her than type  ,estp
Y all she s probably an   if she s an Se dom  Sx  s are the most intuitive sevens and are basically impossible for Se doms let alone ESTPs  If anything she s sp   or sx  ,estp
she s such an icon    also she s too supernatural and multifaceted for me to properly type i m afraid,estp
Why not INFJ with developed Se and Ti   Base on my analysis I think she used Fe more than Se but her Ti is also very developed  I don t see much Ni however that could be because she has planned everything already before joining the school ,estp
i feel her so Ne dominant  she s always seeking for new experiences and changing  idk,estp
E  extroverted  duh  she has a lot of social skills and doesn t like to get bored N  INTUITIVE AS HELL  her plans    everything is just N  T  if she was a feeler  she wouldn t be rude and dismissive of others  emotions  thinkers don t have emotions and have god complexes  P  doesn t like making plans  literally just goes with the flow,estp
To those who are questioning ESTP because of his poor Fe  remember that the tertiary function is naturally weak anyway  People tend to overemphasize how strong it is or should be   A few comments below explained his Ti by describing how he wants to follow what makes sense to himself rather than to others  which suggests that he uses his subjective line of logic and reasoning  Ti    To the   voters  he is the textbook definition of an   and fits well into the trait structures  lust  punitiveness  and  sensory motor  dominance  to name a few  He doesn t kill people to feel safe  he doesn t feel paranoia or sense imagined dangers like a    and he spontaneously jumps into action like an   would  while  s would be more hesitant and calculating   Compare him to Sae byeok  a sx  ,estp
i hate him but i lowkey have a crush on him at the same time if that makes sense    ,estp
People on this site just be pulling things out of their ass when they re bored just to change the consensus for the sake of it  You have this obvious stereotypical ESTP  w  and people are saying  b  but what if he is a cp    Acktually I see Te Si in him    like how are you people even coming to these ridiculous conclusions ,estp
SEXual   because he had sEX  ,estp
He really made me upset when I watched the show  the way how he treated the weaker ones  and how he was constantly using his power against people really went unter my skin  if I would have been there I would have stopped this guy right at the beginning  he is the literal wolf in a herd of black sheep  and nobody tried to stop him a single time  I can imagine many  s made that angry  but I don t hate him  I just hoped he would die early  which was not the case  A great example that he is an   is  that he has a clear understanding of power dynamics  while others did not  thus nobody tried to stop him  because they are just sheep to him  He is the most unhealthy ESTP stereotype I can think of  like a stereotypical school bully that never has learned to get people on his side without force   Fe  He does care about having a crew  a group of people who have his back  hence the   in the tritype  SX SP for his IVs  he has with every character he talks to a different dynamic  and does not treat everyone equally bad  The Se is clear  as a loud  aggressive  physical man who wants to solve all of his problems with mere force and violence  the Ti for his own logic   it is not important if it makes sense to you  but only to me   That fosters this whole I don t care what you think mentality  the Fe of him is really undeveloped  but he does display it when he sees how people view him as  and tries to suppress this right away  how he pressures people  finds the weakest in every group  or when people have something to offer for him  he understands people way better than people give him here credit for  He is not obtuse or blind  Just really rigid and does not allow vulnerability or weakness in his reality  The Ni inferior is obviously the reason why he has found his end  Not to understand that his actions do have simple consequences  and that he cannot evade them by mere force or power  was at the end his biggest weakness  but one cannot blame him  because as this guy was bullying everyone his entire life  probably the fewest have ever stood up against him  thus he never had to learn to adapt  You could say that his biggest strength  was also his biggest weakness  If there is a hell he will burn in it that is for sure ,estp
so where is his fe  tert fe ,estp
I thought this guy was the clearest ESTJ with low Fi  He s like the biggest baby with his low Fi  but masks it in this hyper down to business exterior  not sure where people see Se  he seemed all Te about getting things done  and using people to do it  Like an ESTJ upper management boss  Lol,estp
Another one of those unhealthy ESTP douchebags  ESTPs I m so sorryyy      Unhealthy Fe shows a lot as he manipulated a lot of people who helped him including Mi Nyeo for his own personal gain ,estp
People not mistyping counterphobic sx  s for  s just because they are also aggressive  defiant  determined etc  is pretty damn important to me because it happens way too often    But this guy  an sx    Nah  I really can t see it  He perfectly fits into type  s profile in almost every way and I don t see anything in him that indicates   over     Like others already pointed out  every type is afraid of death or gets scared when they could literally die at any moment  That s a human reaction   s might be the most confident and  fearless  type of the enneagram but they too get scared and want to live  Fear of death and immediate danger and the underlying fear and anxiety of the    and how this influences the entire personality of this type  are two different things  Also  the group of people he leads and controls don t serve as his  support system   the  sh meaning of it   He doesn t require guidance  reassurance or struggles with anything related to type   that requires some form of support system to help him cope with uncertainty   self  doubt and inner insecurity  He takes control of the group and needs them to work for him so that he has a much better chance to actually survive everything  It s as simple as that   Like  it s good that people look more into the difference of  s and sx  s  also  s and sx  s  sx  s etc   but just calling an   a   for being scared of death and trying to prevent it isn t the way this works ,estp
Se Te nation for sure  To sum it up Instant Gratification and Results NOW    This all basically starts very young too  Middle school  we re already losing our virginity  age       while others lose it much later  Usually guys  The irony is we re a very repressed society  Despite this fact we see it as morally wrong or perverse  You ll never see a statement like this mentioned anywhere in the mainstream as it would cause a panic  similar to the satanic panic of the   s    Endless streams of entertainment on the internet  TV movies  music  streaming  Gossip    In real life everyone is on some kind of medication or drinking  smoking  making love or all of the above  Eating junk food or ordering from instant services like uber  grubhub postmates    We focus on the experience  Remove the symptoms experience the pleasure  deal with the consequences later  Needless to say our nation is obese  dies of preventive diseases like heart disease and others  We re in bad debt for the same philosophy  Buy now  Pay later    Holistic approaches to health are rare unless its sold as something flashy or novel    Like  superfoods   Instead of actually being holistic which means measuring RESULTS and finding what works for you  taking medications  going to therapy  sleeping well  exercising  and eating filling and sustaining meals vs going on strict diets only to binge eat junk food weeks later and repeat the cycle  This frustrating cycle leads everyone to just pop a pill to fix all their issues because pleasure now  pain later which is never the case unfortunately for us    Being cool means being socially bold and partying  taking drugs alcohol  having the best clothes houses cars to show off  Te aux certainly helps acquire them so you can blow it all being Se dom  Prevalence of following cults  and trendy fads like diets  keto  low fat  paleo  carnivore  vegans  organic nongmo etc etc  or getting scammed by get rich quick schemes on youtube  MLMs and similar products    Cults like Scientology  celebrity worship  really any christian group outside of the major institutions  Protestants  catholics etc    like jehovah witness  mormons  small church groups or pastor personalities are all cults that suck you in with Se and force you into Fe Si which causes suffering and eventually documentaries that feed Ni inferior about the horrors of these cults after blindly entering them    This includes ideologies and movements  like the democratic party vs republicans  conservatives or liberals  the intense protests that lead to no change that is replaced with a new novel cause to follow to feel good    Communists socialists  or Capitalists Patriots people who identify with labels that draw attention  We are entering Fi territory but america is so superficial that it s actually all just unhealthy Se    So this includes spiritual new age movements  or all political trends  eat the rich    super straight   MAGA  anything that draws attention and gets people angry  They think they re angry but really its all just dopamine and ego  Its all entertaining which is why people get so passionate about it    Most americans live pay check to paycheck  Yet still complain about income inequality  inferior Ni     Income inequality is real for sure but money habits determine way more than any scapegoat you can ever come up with    Ni inferior is evident with our paranoia  conspiracy theories  and erratic behaviors    Se wants to experience life and show it off  Thats what our culture has always been about  At least since the     s after we got rich off WWII       PS  Im not judging anyone only presenting what I see as american culture and who we are as a country  If i m wrong  then im wrong  Se means these are things people do superficially    Individually speaking we have people who are genuinely involved with everything I mentioned in a deep level and actually practice what they show outwardly  Good for you  If the shoe doesn t fit  don t wear it  I m completely indifferent to what people actually do with their life    What I see is that we re very superficial  Even me  I m not better than you  I have self awareness  I at least I try to  You can too  If you want    Despite our culture we still have Americans who are complete opposites to this  You are not better than the average american either    It s all just pros and cons on different levels that intersect with each other  If you don t like it you can improve yourself  your community  you can leave the country  you can just get get on with life  or do nothing    If something I said offended you  Remember one simple truth of all life  All humans  without exception  eventually die   In that regard  We re all the same ,estp

Rainbow Dash has   traits because that is her  nd enneagram fix  she does not have the core motivation and fear of a     Basic Fear  Of being deprived and in pain Basic Desire  To be satisfied and content to have their needs fulfilled  Everything Rainbow Dash does is motivated by her drive to succeed and prove herself  core     She really is the type   poster child    Sx   also doesn t make sense   The Sexual Subtype focuses on a spark of intense connection with another individual  Sexual  Sx  subtypes want intense bonds  relationships  and experiences    Sexual Sevens are imaginative and idealistic  always envisioning possibilities that could be on the horizon  True dreamers at heart  they strive to be optimistic no matter what life hurls their way  At the same time  they can easily feel trapped and overwhelmed when life feels mundane or repetitive   Now here s the social   type   The Social Subtype focuses on the content of relationships and wants to be liked and work with others toward shared goals    The Social Three has a desire to be seen and to have influence with people  This three acts out in vanity through the desire to shine before the whole world  Social Threes enjoy being on stage  This subtype is the most vain of the Threes  and the biggest chameleon   The name given to this subtype is  Prestige   which reflects the idea of needing everybody s admiration and applause  This Three  more than the other two subtypes  likes and needs to be recognized  so they tend to be more out in front  basking in the spotlight  As children  it was typically important for Social Threes to  show  something  to look good and demonstrate competence in doing things  to get love  Support most likely came in the form of an approving  look  from parents   You could fit Rainbow Dash into sexual    but social   fits her much better   Anyways  I m still leaning towards  w     w   because I think she is more centered around personal goals    wing  over making connections    wing  ,estp
Now that her Enneagram has finally been fixed to    can we change her IV   Though she still has elements of SX   she is moreso SO  first and foremost  Rarity is more of a SX    SO    The Social Three desires influence above all and tends to skillfully read and adjust to the social norms and requirements of teams or organizations  Highly competitive  they enjoy being in the spotlight and confidently market their ideas and accomplishments  Looking good and successful is very important and they may cut corners or cover up failure  so long as the finished product makes them and their team look good    SX    This charismatic and enthusiastic Three focuses their competitiveness on supporting others  seeing success in relational terms  They tend to believe  if those around me achieve success  then I am successful  which may lead them to mistype as a Two  They tend to compete for the attention and affection of those closest to them  and may suppress their own feelings to make themselves more attractive to others  ,estp

ESTPnin v cut bulmu  hali,estp
While Joseph is very creative and comes up with unique ways to defeat his opponents he still is an Se dom  He lives in the present and he doesn t really seem idealistic  Also  he doesn t have any strong internal values or morals  he just cares about people in general  like how he saved Smokey from the cops  so I think his Fe is stronger than his Fi,estp
hard to explain  but im gonna go with ISTP  but a really unstereotypical ISTP  His Se and Ti are absolutely evident but  the first thing I noticed was that one of his biggest traits was his hability to have everything planned before it happens  showing that he s not exactly in tune with the present  but with the future   And then the part when he shoots Straizo and says to the scared girls to shut up  was so aggressive lmao  it felt more like a fe inf than a fe tert for me ,estp
when i read ESTP  he appears in my mind,estp
Pretty clear that chad chadstar uses Se Ti Fe with an inferior Ni  subjective but he reminds me of most ESTP ennea     I know  even though he is a fictional character   In summary  ESTP s are like their ENTP brothers big trolls  but not in debates and with their intellect  but in the physical realm  so physical activites  fights  sports  etc     Se dom He just lives in the moment and is connected with his   senses  he is driven and drawn to physical activities and excels in it   He is aware what is going on around him at all times and senses any change in physical movements and is always confident and comfortable with his physical enviroment   Ti aux Basically during his entire arc when he       situations up because of his distaste of thinking before acting  he realizes he needs to come up with solutions and as we all have seen  He uses his Ti to analyze the deep      he is in  figures out where the problems are and fixes it  For example when the pilar man got him in big trouble and shuts them down one by one even though he gets faced with the most random situations ,estp
Joseph is ESFP it is stuck in his face,estp
Why the   fix in his tritype tho,estp
sensors are physically incapable of coming up with ideas or being creative  We leave all of that to the intuitive  INFP it is,estp
I ve only started on part   but oh wow his Se Ti is very much there right off the bat from the ep we meet him Se is very much there it wasn t until the second episode or later in the first his Ti started showing but oh man the moment his Se Ti usage started showing it was off the bat this man is an obvious ESTP,estp

There is alot of eights and   s in the comments,estp
She s one of the best characters of all time and she knows it  I swear that this girl is the most ESTP someone could ever be,estp
Ah  The enneagram is why i kin her so much  That explains it  The fact somebody genuinely considered ENFP is hilarious  I could also see her as an ENTP with  F and  L ,estp
 F   Someone please explain ,estp
what do u guys think her ap is because it s definitely not VLEF   she s literally a se dom theres no way shes  F,estp
One of the most ESTP  stereotyped  characters on tv,estp
sp   really does make the most sense to me for eleanor  According to beatrice chestnut   The driving need of Self Preservation Eights can be described as an exaggerated ability to take care of themselves and find ways to meet their needs  In their focus on fulfilling their needs  they demonstrate a kind of exaggerated selfishness  They feel omnipotent in being able to satisfy and meet any need  and they disqualify any feeling  person  idea  or institution that opposes their desires  They will go against whatever   Yes  she demonstrated profound personal growth throughout the course of the show  but you can t deny that exaggerated self sufficiency describes her core inclinations perfectly ,estp
i love her so much  anyways why  f  ,estp
Binged watched it summer of       and then I binged it this weekend  She s almost the epitome of a  w  from what I can recall  especially in how Michael reiterates her fear of vulnerability  when Eleanor attempts to use philosophical determinism as an excuse for her feelings for Chidi   betrayal from her mother  and her having the need to  look out for herself  once she realizes she s exempt from earning any points  which also displays dominant self preservation ,estp
Why sp   She seemed too sensitive for that  I think sx  makes more sense ,estp
Se,estp
the stereotyping of Fi usage in this comment section is ridiculous   doing the right thing  is NOT Fi ,estp
we ve already established how he s a se dom but really    ESTP    this man has fi in a gorilla GRIP  ie  refusing to abide by his family death eater beliefs and continued to do so even when he got in huge trouble for it   i would have died  i would have died rather than betray my friends    etc etc   as some other comments are saying  i d say james is ESTP  developing fe after taking in sirius  and sirius is ESFP,estp
I don t really see  V in him  he feels like a EVFL tbh ,estp
Hmmmmm sx seven   Those r usually see life through rose colored glasses and described as enthusiastic romantics  Mayb sp ,estp
why sx         he showed no interest in anyone throughout the books movies,estp
James  ESTP  Sirius  ESFP  He even said he d die rather than betray his friends like Peter Pettigrew   Fi  I mean this guy was the first Griffindor of his family cause he valued his principles so much over his familly tradition of Slytherin  Se dom is obvious as stated in previous comments  He s about action and movement  Right now  Very proactive  not really speculating or abstract ,estp
Why Confident Emotion  Why ,estp
Does anyone have any decent arguements of Se use over Ne  I don t know the character in depth so it would be interesting to hear peoples reasoning   ,estp
I can understand MBTI ENTP and Socionics SLE but this kind of vice versa is very weird  ILE is a chill type interested in logically dealing with theories and intellectual pursuits   He is rather an intense guy who goes against the existing traditions and systems with aggressivity and action  while looking for groups sharing similar values with him to join   These traits are related to Beta quadra and lot of his behaviors revolve around strong Se  So SLE is the most likely ,estp
Why do people think she s a   core  Almost her whole personality revolves around her wanting to have security  I don t think a   core would do that,estp
really thought there would be more ENTP votes  glad there aren t,estp
WE DID IT YALL LETS GOOOO SHES PROPERLY TYPED YEAHHHHH,estp
why does she sound like raquelle from barbie omg,estp
also thought that shes a   but that scene when she said she wanted to get pregnant from shuichi so he wont leave her just REALLY screams   also the way she needed reassurance before talking to know she has support the fact that her ideal lover concept was a childhood friend  a person that no matter how much time passed they still stayed by her side yk  ,estp
I LOVE HER SM SHE DESERVED BETTER,estp
if this page was as active as nagito s  we would have fixed her enneagram months ago edit  wow we re almost there,estp
Hi im new here but wanted to vote anyway cause something feels off on her profile   ,estp
 Instead of saying a bunch of vulgar things  why not use your brain a little    SLE epic rekt and verbally destroyed by SLI,estp
I was thinking  ther is a possibility that she is ISTP    Im saying this because i can see her having Fe   What do you think  I would like to hear some thoughs on this ,estp

Trump doesn t seem to fit into either of the type   subtypes  He s obviously not a so    and he is too rambunctious to be a sp    Sx eights are described as   like cause of how emotionally intense they are  which i don t think applies to trump  I think he s most likely just an unhealthy so  w ,estp

God damn wonder when we will see an non stereotypical ESTP other than Oscar Schindler and Ernest Hemingway,estp
His jungian type is gamma SeNiTe  w   He is an ESFP in reverse development  aka showcasing an hybrid behavior between ESFP ENTJ fixating on Fi  as I explained in the following video  https   youtu be ZzeAD  Tb I,estp
He got the Karen type  lol ,estp
hate to break it to the gxrls but this man radiates sx sp    It s part of his appeal to his fanbase   that polarizing  toxic  intense sx charisma ,estp
social            donald trump      ,estp
i see Fi  to me his ability in galvanizing huge crowds of adorers isn t because of strong Fe  it s because they just idolize him no matter what he does  and he does and says whatever he wants,estp
The way he and Andrew Jackson have practically the same personality   ,estp
ENTJ mastermind  reminds me alot of Bakugo  who is also ENTJ ,estp
Anyone else have a feeling he s an ENTJ with an ESTP persona ,estp
Why someone thinks he is ENTJ  ,estp
Wait  this one is heavily debated  I thought the vast majority of people thought ESTP  Anyone have a reason for typing him differently ,estp
Any single Se proof  I d say some of his improvs durning the reporters swarm seems Ne driven  Him waving hands isn t Se  I am sure he s capiable of making a character of himself  being f e  ESTJ and putting effort to turn Te into Ti puns  In his speech he mention lots of numbers  stats  repeating them several times  which makes him Te  Putin with his Ti likes to make a long diplomatic speech and when asked about the arguments  stats  he losing confidence  that s how Ti doubts itself  even if he s lying he has no Te ground to stand on  ,estp

Its      am           and you are the first profile of ESTPs not glad,estp
Pretty stereotypical version of an ESTP in behavior but kind of comes across as a hybrid ESTP ISTP in terms of function usage   Uses a lot of Si imagery in his rhetoric  but it s kind of mocking and this suggests Si as shadow function to me  ESFPs do this kind of thing sometimes too    Pretty clear inferior Ni with fear of being poisoned and wanting to eat fast food as a result of that fear  Also  the symbolism he uses is quite literal  which suggests Se and possibly Ni in his particular case  although he doesn t seem to use Ni very often    Fe tertiary is pretty clear with the way he plays the crowd  He seems to be decent at using Fe  but it doesn t seem like a dominant force for him  In the case of Ti  it s a little harder to tell where that exactly fits in  except that he supposedly is somewhat indecisive  which suggests a lack of Te  Trying to find the perfect answer innately logical answer  but he is somewhat of a jumper IMO w  focus on Se and Fe  Certainly shows no minimal interest in Fi or in Ne in my view  The tertiary and inferior functions are easier for me to deal with than auxiliary in this case  which seems a bit tricky  But in any case  I like ESTP jumper best for President Trump  probably doesn t have much experience dealing w  his introverted functions    I thought about unhealthy ESTJ for Trump  but I think ESTJ fits better for DeSantis  and DeSantis seems at least a reasonably healthy ESTJ to me actually  ,estp
Too fat to be an ESTP Too lazy to be an ENTJ  Too stupid to be an ENTP  Too chaotic to be an ENFJ  So ENFP,estp
this man is the definition of an sx   how tf    people here really do not know about subtypes ,estp
I know a lot of people type him as an ESTP and I see their points but let s face it Trump would type himself as an ENTJ because ENTJs LOVE POWER AND TRUMP BELIEVES HE IS SMART AND ON TIME ,estp
i   bad social skills    n   smart    f   cried after losing the election lol j   mean,estp
im convinced you guys dont understand variants at this point lmao,estp
The confusion of ENTJ vs ESTP probably stems from his  w  enneagram  common for ENTJs   Really though it should be no question he s an ESTP  they don t even share the same functions ,estp
I just went onto this page out of curiosity but HOW IS HE A SOCIAL   IM IN PAIN ,estp
How is he not ENTP  The creativity of the dumb      he says should indicate Ne domness,estp
Who voted this guy ENTJ knows nothing about ENTJs,estp
Im torn between SLE and SEE for trump  i can see some good arguements for both  although im leaning towards SLE,estp
On the Enneagram  many Threes are fantastic people  but Trump falls on the dark side of the       If I recall from Katherine Fauvre s Tritype theory  if you lead with   and have Tritype      your Tritype will go    Plan A       Plan B       Plan C       If Plan A s strategies fail to solve a problem  you go to Plan B  If Plan B s strategies then fail to solve a problem  you go to Plan C    I think Trump is a     whose   steps in whenever he s losing in Type    his main approach to life  When he receives any threat to his successful image  he gets confrontational  Consider that  despite his confrontation and strong presence  he s always trying to protect his Core   image and persuade the public that he s shinier and more successful than other people  If his   s confrontation fails  he falls to   and seeks to escape somewhere where he feels he can win back positive attention his Core   lives on    The Enneagram Institute contrasts the   and   in terms of the   s deceit and the   s straightforwardness     Achieving personal power is the dominating drive in Eights  and there is nothing ambiguous  much less furtive or duplicitous  about them        If Eights are too busy achieving their purposes to worry about public opinion  Threes live and die on the opinions of others and desperately want to be in demand socially  If average Eights are combative and intimidating and can  take the heat   despite a certain bravado  average Threes will back down or be driven to deviousness  they cannot take pressure for long or exposure for a moment  In short  even average Eights are the  genuine article   whereas average Threes are an imitation of it     Source      Donald Trump is notorious for falling into the dark side of    aiming to cover up and misrepresent his shortcomings  consider the word  deviousness  in the above paragraph  He lies constantly to try to keep his image looking shiny and successful  He may be a poor liar  but he s always insisting that he s important and that others don t have the same achievements and marks of success that he has    If I m not mistaken  the   believes that confronting the dark truth is a matter of strength and courage  whereas Trump is always trying to hide whatever truth would make him look unsuccessful  Also  Eights don t care about being popular in the same way Threes do     Eights need independence  Trump is extremely dependent on what people think of him  He begins to whine or preach anytime he begins to look like a failure  immediately trying to a  persuade people that he s distinguished  or b  insist that his adversaries are less distinguished    The Enneagram Institute details the unhealthy levels of Type      Unhealthy Levels  Level    Fearing failure and humiliation  they can be exploitative and opportunistic  covetous of the success of others  and willing to do  whatever it takes  to preserve the illusion of their superiority   Level    Devious and deceptive so that their mistakes and wrongdoings will not be exposed  Untrustworthy  maliciously betraying or sabotaging people to triumph over them  Delusionally jealous of others  Level    Become vindictive  attempting to ruin others  happiness  Relentless  obsessive about destroying whatever reminds them of their own shortcomings and failures  Psychopathic behavior  Generally corresponds to the Narcissistic Personality Disorder     Level    as detailed above   storming the White House after losing the      election  He felt humiliated after losing  so he had to use unfair methods to try to protect his fame    Threes fear failure deeply because they see it as a personal humiliation  a potential occasion for being rejected  their deepest fear  By contrast  Eights see failure as an opportunity to learn something and come back stronger     Source      As a final Enneagram remark  if you d like to watch the following short YouTube video       in duration   you might see how Trump s   and   show from his Tritype  Trump defaults to    charming the public to get them on his side  using humor and trying to align with their desires  Once he feels disrupted  his Plan B     steps in to powerfully seize control of the situation    Video  Donald Trump Urges Crowd to Chant  Turn Off the Lights  | NBC News      As for Socionics  I think Trump is an SEE  He focuses heavily on Socionics  Fi through persuasion  forming alliances  and judging people s character in a sharp  Gamma Quadra fashion     I was thinking SLE for a while  but I changed my mind  I think Trump prefers attaining maintaining the loyalty of his supporters and showing his foes  evil over the SLE s tendency to use systems and ideologies  The SLE would be more organized through ideology and a mission of unwavering principles whereas Trump will throw all Ti principled consistency out the window for in the moment salesmanship ,estp
He is extroverted ethical for sure  those are the passionate  agitated types  ESTP is actually a calmer and more subdued leader  striving to work in the shadows ,estp
I think a lot of famous Ixxx people are mistyped as Exxx because their job requires them to act that way and Trump is just one example  Here is why he is INFJ   Ni   he is very future oriented and focused on ideas  for example building a big beautiful wall or making America great again  A Se dom would be way more concerned with how the US actually is at the moment instead of having a precise vision of what it could be in the future   Fe   he is a really good speaker  able to influence people  However  this can sometimes make him seem manipulative   Ti   you can tell that this is not his strongest function but that is normal since it s his tertiary  I m sure he will develop it with age,estp
A common point made in favor of SEE over SLE is that Donald Trump has no ideological principles  a claim which I take great issue with  Just because Donald Trump isn t some sort of radical revolutionary doesn t mean he can t be an SLE  After all  many SLE leaders before have chosen pragmatism over strict ideology  such as Napoleon Bonaparte  Otto Von Bismarck  Alexander the Great  Winston Churchill  Juan Per n  Theodore Roosevelt  This is because of SLE s demonstrative Te and flexible use of Ti  Hell  even the most ideological SLE I can think of  Vladimir Lenin  would make pragmatic decisions that went against his ideology  such as allowing free markets to boost economic production and output after the USSR s economy took a nose dive during the civil war and after  So Trump being a pragmatist still fits right in with this group  unless you want to argue that all of them were SEE as well   But in addition to that  how exactly can you say that Trump doesn t have any sort of ideology  Donald Trump has a very clear and consistent worldview  He believes that there are two types of people  winners and losers  He wants to be a winner in this zero sum game through which his worldview is filtered  Just because these aren t political beliefs doesn t mean it doesn t count as an ideology  however simplistic and incorrect this view is   Beyond that  if you ignore that and only focus on politics  Trump still has very clear and internally consistent principles which he has maintained since he started commenting on politics in the    s  His political views are a collectivistic extension of his zero sum  winners and losers ideology  Go and watch older interviews where he is asked about his political views  Trump is very consistent in his worldview that America needs to operate transactionally  so that America starts  winning  instead of  losing   This worldview formed the basis of his  America First  ideology  Compare him to an actual SEE president  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  who didn t concern himself with consistent ideological views  rather he concerned himself with just getting things done  His new deal programs were just a mishmash of ideas  in which he kept the ones that worked and threw out the ones that didn t  a very pragmatic  Te oriented program  Donald Trump s policies were centered around this singular ideological goal of making America a  winner  instead of a  loser   policies such as his opposition to free trade  his trade war with China  his transactional foreign policy  his opposition to climate regulation and the Paris accords  Donald Trump s policies were all centered around his personal  winners and losers  worldview  while FDR s policies were throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks   TLDR  Donald Trump being a pragmatist does not in any way invalidate the SLE typing  and the idea that Donald Trump doesn t have any sort of clear and consistent ideological worldview is also just plain incorrect  Donald Trump very clearly has an internally consistent worldview ,estp

I think SLE is simply absurd for Trump  SLEs tend to have judgements based on ideologically static principles and tend to criticize and make decisions based on that static and stable sense of principles and methodology  Trump simply doesn t make judgements or decisions with the previously described aspects of Ti egos and SLEs  Whenever we see Trump talking about political opponents  he almost always criticizes their character with statements like  he is a good man    he is crooked    I think he is sick    stupid  etc   just to give a few examples  I am well aware that he does have principles and political views and values  and does argue in favor for him  he obviously has had to  but he always tends to focus and go after people s character  attitude  values  and likeness  That is not Ti ego  but rather Fi  he analyzes and figures people out  what makes them tick  their character attitudes  etc  He doesn t really focus that much on their ideological affiliations  if at all ,estp

 Socionics Model G typing   Is Trump SLE in the WSS school  Probably yes  I think in their definitions he fits SLE better than SEE  Perhaps also in other Model A schools like SSS  But I no longer really use those systems  despite combining them in the past when I switched to typing him SLE   preferring Model G and the understanding of socionics in the SHS and in this system Trump is an SEE rather than an SLE  For subtype  it s fairly clear that Trump is Dominant Creative  double contact  The subtype combination most inclined to leadership  of companies  countries  and other things  One argument attacks the idea of Te mobilizing for him not taking in Te information from others  Te Mobilizing is not about taking in info on practical matter or listening to those with experience  Te Mobilizing  particularly the Te  Mobilizing of SEEs  simply means that the mood of an SEE depends on how well they re doing economically  The better they are doing  the more lively and happy they are  It also works the other way round to an extent   if in an upbeat mood  then they are highly generous  but they are miserly when depressed  Te Mobilizing also manifests as jumping onto new ventures which can be profitable  joining a new venture like so has a positive effect on the mood of the SEE   A further part of Te  Mobilizing is   He is very nervous and angry if he is bypassed in business or financial resources are distributed in such a way that he gets less than others  Because of this  it can cause scandal   Not wanting to be bypassed in business is actually evidence for Te Mobilizing  Te Mobilizing fits Trump well   For contrast  Te  Creative of SLEs is   A good boss who knows how to organize a business  Benefits from any enterprise  In business  he is not inclined to save  Doesn t value small sums  Thrifty only in large  Has craft skills  However  with a heavy workload  he will hire people to do it for him  Likes to control complex equipment in extreme situations  People are also tested in action  throwing untrained  swim  immediately to the depth     They like to delegate with heavy workloads and test the abilities of people  They are also good at making sure businesses don t fail   Another argument states that Trump is an Fe valuer  Well  Fe is part of his Social Mission  Se into Fe    Reach mutually beneficial agreements between the warring parties    which is  basically  the art of the deal   SEEs actually do value the emotional atmosphere and try to have an impact on it   and especially with DC subtype which boosts Fe a lot  SLEs also like a specific emotional atmosphere but they want a competitive  stereotypically Beta atmosphere to spur them on to action  Trump doesn t want competition and doesn t invite it like SLEs do  he just wants to win  SEEs love informal atmospheres and can t work with bad vibes around them   Is Trump strong with Fe  Yes  but Fe in SEEs is not as strong as the Fe base of EIEs  which is unbeatable in its dramatic effect  EIE is the most common type in Hollywood and a common type IRL and we are used to seeing Fe base  Trump does not have the ability to have constantly on Fe like many people we see and that we re almost used to seeing  but his Fe is still much stronger than mine as an Fe Mobilizing  Obama  the president before him  had Fe base  Trump is not as effective with his Fe as many EIE presidents are   but it s better than a logical type   Another argument states that Trump can t have strong Fi and certainly can t have strong and valued Fi  Well for SEEs  Fi is only the  th most visible function after Se  Fe  and Ne  It is introverted and generally only comes out in private for self realization purposes  Any Fi problems can be dealt with but it s not evident due to conflicting with the natural extraversion of SEEs  Fi  Demonstrative in SEEs manifests as telling people what they want to hear  balancing interests between opposing groups  frequently trying to negotiate  and easily reconciling with former adversaries when necessary  As for valuing Fi  I should say this isn t really relevant to me  Function valuations tend to be interfered with heavily by DCNH subtype  E G  H subtype LSIs can easily mistype as Si valuing and think they re SXI    I can answer any questions on this typing but I think that Trump as SEE makes considerably more sense than Trump as SLE ,estp

can you guys learn subtypes bc in what world is he a so    this type expresses lust in service of other people through protection and loyalty  aka the friendliest   subtype who wants to take care of others and may even be nurturing but anti social in the sense that they don t feel obligated to abide by social norms or rules of society  Trump fits none of this except the antisocial aspect  which is even more prominent in sx s  who express lust through open rebellion  they re the type that doesnt mind being outwardly disrespectful towards laws or regulations of any kind so lmk how that isnt him,estp
This might be the biggest L on this website  If you want to type the obvious IMAGE Trump puts on as ESTP to make you guys happy  then that s fine  If you look at the person behind the IMAGE you will be able to see that he is an ENTJ  you can t ignore that Trump was always an extremely successful businessman who excelled at monopolising and building towards the future  It is not impossible for an ESTP to become this but you guys gotta watch some of those old interviews   pure Te Se    I keep putting the word IMAGE in capital letters because him being type   is once again another fat L  Love him or hate him    you have to admit he is a master at creating an image  When he was President everyone was laughing at him  making jokes  and listening to him go off on his twitter    which is exactly what he wanted and literally just fed into his popularity and IMAGE    Once again  not every SLE Te dom is an ESTP ,estp
Donald Trump is a social    not an    The whole reason he wanted to become president was to gain prestige  He slaps his family name on every building  every organization he creates  He was completely distraught and in denial when he lost the      election  He s      an image type  People are voting  w  based on stereotypes of him being    angry  The social   is named  Prestige  which pretty exactly describes Trump  sx is next in his stacking because sx  s tend to be more charismatic and intense  sp   is not like Trump at all  He has a   wing because he is more concerned with his individuality and need to stand out over his need to feel useful to those around him  Please fix this enneagram mistype   ,estp
He s pretty good with feelings atmosphere giving people what they want by addressing immigrant issue and respecting individual rights through idiotic solutions such as building a wall and lazily implementing pandemic protocols  I get he s old so that might impair his judgement but he s a full blown narcissist that will do anything to get on the front page  Even at the cost of lives ,estp
I know this argument is a long shot but hear me out  Donald Trump is an sx  w  EIE  I understand that his w  is very prevalent  when you are a notorious businessman and a president of the most powerful country that is naturally how it is going to play out  he is very grandiose and braggadocios but let s not forget that he was born into this wealthy lifestyle  however  we can see that he does not feel that he fits in with his wealthy comrades  he feels a deep sense of inferiority  he feels as if he is dumber or less competent than his equals  however  he actively tries to stand out and away from the crowd  he projects his inferiority on the culture of elites he was raised in and actively antagonizes it  sx     why do you think he ran for president  he did it show up the elite culture that constantly made fun of him such as Obama and his democrat colleagues  if you know an sx   in your life then you definitely see how he fits this archetype  of course he shows   and   traits to but they are much weaker than his desire to find an identity and stand out  he wants people to follow him  not the other way around    now onto EIE  now I know Donald Trump appears different from your typical EIE but we have to remember that the circumstances he is under are strange in and of itself  he was born into an LIE lifestyle with an EIE heart  first of all we can see he is very confident in his own Fe  now of course he polarizes many  but his fanatics have an otherworldly obsession with him  we can see a similar case with Kanye West  and suddenly it makes so much sense why they got along so well  anyways  it is why he so easily courted the Republican Party to his side and formed an almost cult like obsession among his followers with himself  Ni creative makes sense as well  he can very easily see things coming and make things bend to his will in reaction  look at the correspondence party  when Obama made fun of him  Trump knew that in order to get the ultimate revenge he had to essentially take his job from him  his Se mobilizing is the most insecure thing about him  he tries way too hard to be the tough guy but on the outside he looks much weaker than he thinks he is  he is obsessed with standing his ground and showing off  we can see his  D unvalued Ne  when he suggested that we should nuke the hurricanes  he was certainly thinking outside the box although the idea was somewhat weak given his  D Ti  last but not least  he is very much an Si PoLR  he quite literally has the weirdest sleep schedule of all the past presidents  apart from that you can tell he has no idea of how to regulate his health and he simply lets himself go   I hope you guys read this with an open mind   ,estp
Aren t  s known for honesty  accepting harsh realities  and speaking the truth directly   I find that Trump embodies the dark side of    the vice of deceit  Doesn t he misrepresent all sorts of news and facts in an attempt to keep his image looking shiny and victorious ,estp
Trump is definitely an ESTP  in kind of an obvious and stereotypical way  materialistic  cares a lot about his social status  always thinks he s right no matter what   these traits are much heightened in him due to his narcissism   Don t know why some people vote ENTJ  there s literally no Ni in him  On the contrary  he s always present in the moment and very aware of his surroundings  He can be pretty reckless too  not thinking about the consequences of his actions  Te is also not one of his strengths as he tends to dismiss objective data and follows his own rationale and understanding of things  Ti Te    P  S  I have a YT channel about the MBTI types of celebrities and movie characters  If you would like to check it out  here is the link to my recent video  Kim Kardashian analysis   I ve created a Kardashians series      ,estp
as an ESTP  i hate to say he s one of us  but i think it s obvious  he s a Se dom  who is definitely in tune with his surroundings  he also has very strong Ti  as he is more objective with his views  though a lot may be morally incorrect   he has more Fe than Fi  as he most definitely bases his decisions on the outside world  i think his Ni inferior is obvious  but not by a lot  i just dont really think he questions himself very often   the real issue i have is with the  w  enneagram votes  i think he has   and   in his tritype  enneagram type   s are very dominating people  which i do think he is  but he is very obviously a type    type    or the achiever  are people who will do anything to be successful  donald very obviously can and will do anything to become successful  i think that s part of why he s so controversial  he does controversial  morally incorrect things to succeed in his life  his main goal is very obviously success  type    or the enthusiast  is not his main type  it s in his tritype  but he s less scattered and variety seeking than us   s   w  s are natural rulers  which donald very clearly is due to how objective he is ,estp
Ti  then Se  Fe is more problematic for Donald Trump than Ni is  It makes more sense that he would have inferior Fe and tertiary Ni  Could also be ESTP or ESTJ   Even though  w  could make sense for him  I think that  w  is more likely since he doesn t really care much when others take control or violate his principles  which was seen throughout his presidency  and even now after when he doesn t care about Joe Biden  and just wants to stay relavant ,estp
Classic  w  ESTP  I ll have to contest his typing as a type     At no point does Donald Trump ever display signs of being a type   if not for cases where he is clearly trying to preserve his reputation  Otherwise  he never shows desire to be in control of the situation  This is a man far more obsessed with how he is perceived  successful  powerful  important  Loved or hated is a different story  but he s far more focused in having people know who he is  That s his motivation   Power  Control of his own fate  Not particularly ,estp
Guys he is SUCH an INFJ why are y all acting silly        Ni dom  Envisions his presidency campaign years in advance  extremely skilled liar  tricked media into thinking he wasn t planning his whole spiel since like       Exceptional grifting earns him the popularity and support needed to win presidency   he knows exactly what his voter base likes  Able to put aside his true self in favor of an outgoing  energetic  and rude persona that appeals better to the voters    Fe aux  Logic and due process are thrown out the window as raw emotional appeal takes center stage  As already mentioned  he is a good grifter  He excels at relating to a wide range of people and winning their solidarity behind his banner    Ti tert  Skilled deep analysis of English diction allows him to choose the most publicly powerful and appealing words to post on Twitter  complementing his persona  Being a tertiary function  though  he often slips up  He likes science  but only when it speaks      in his favor    Se inf  His whole persona is built largely around this function  which is actually his inferior  As already described in detail above  he shows willingness to sacrifice all desires of living in the moment in favor of concocting and playing out the biggest brained presidential campaign plan of the   st century  Ironically  this plan involves overblowing his inferior Se    This is all sarcasm ,estp
Every ENTJ argument Ive seen is paired up with how amazing a president he was  Bruh ,estp
The fact that    people think that Donald Trump is an INFP   ,estp
where tf do y all think this dude is So     y all realize IVs and enneagram go hand in hand right  no way in hell this dude is a social  ,estp
Y all gotta be kidding for voting SEE he neither value socio Fi or is good at it  He is the stereotypically immoral Fi PoLR XLE  He seems not to use Ti cuz he is dumb  that s all  But Demo Te shows ,estp
Too much Te to be an ESTP,estp
I dont really see Ti    At all     I agree with him being an emneageam core   but I doubt   is in his tritype  I feel like ESTJ makes much more sense than ESTP,estp
 s don t generally need to  prove  themselves  They just dominate  it has nothing to do with showing off  only avoiding being controlled   s and  s on the other hand do need to prove their strength and status  They peacock for their security and image  Trump lied about his inauguration ceremony being a full house  That s really not an   trait bro     I say he s an   second fix because conflict doesn t seem to be a point of contention for him and he seems to make fun out of it  The second fix is refered to as  the playground    Think of the kung flu comment  Or his debates  He seems to almost treat it like a joke or a game    Core  s treat conflict more seriously ,estp
He s the stereotypical  bad guy  ESTP  does that mean he is an actual ESTP  Can t say  I don t really feel like watching his speeches and debates to find out what type he actually is ,estp
As far as socionics goes  he seems very uncomfortable with both Ti and Fi  I don t see a trace of Ti s idealism in him  which makes me question his typing as a SLE   It s clear that he feels comfortable with Fe    more than Te  anyway  Very dramatic person  He also talks like a Dynamic type from Reinin dichotomies  Do you think it s possible that he s a Fe base  Why or why not ,estp
For any Social   voters   Hillary Clinton is also voted as Social    Can you find any similarity between Trump and Hillary    or do you disagree with the vote result of Hillary  ,estp
He s an   not a    He wants power because he wants to control people and to not be controlled  He doesn t exhibit any   traits like wanting to charm his way to power  he uses brute force and lies  He gets off at controlling his little trumpy minions to storm the capital or start riots because it demonstrates that he has control over them and there s nothing you can do about it  A   would never do this in fear of the public back lash  He doesn t care about his public image  he doesn t care if people like him or not  He wants people to respect him and view him as strong  something  s tend not to care about ,estp
The logical conclusion of  Donald Trump can t be an ESTP because ESTPs have Fe  and he doesn t care about people so he can t have Fe  is that only Fi users are capable of being selfish and there has never been a selfish Fe user ever  This is obviously a ridiculous belief  so the idea that Donald Trump is an ESFP or ENTJ because he doesn t care about others is absolutely absurd ,estp
I have a question  why is he social     I don t think he s a person who exercises his power to protect his group or those close to him   I think sexual   suits him best  He seems to have a strong desire to overwhelm the people around him and take control of the situation ,estp
Seems socioFe valuing rather than socioTe valuing  Since when have you heard Trump talk about hard work or accept information or practical help from others  He thinks he knows everything  he would rather do one of his rallies than read a briefing  Fe valuing Te valuing   He d rather give other people the practical management stuff while he does the fun  Hence why he was a stronger candidate than president ,estp
I don t really see the Socio Ti in Donald Trump  he s not at all calculated or systematic like an SLE  He plays the social game to gain power  He knows who s on his side and who isn t and he rallies up the people on his side  via demonstrative Fe not Hidden Agenda Fe  to overpower those who aren t  He exercises social energy and is an expert networker  He s anti structure and chaotic in a Ti PoLR way ,estp
Donald Trump is probably an ESFP  An unhealthy         up ESFP sure  but he isn t calculated or logical like an ESTP  I really do think he s going on his gut instinct for what he says and does  especially on the stage  He uses his Fi  not dominant of course  he mostly uses Se  to make false judgements about what is true by believing what he feels to be true    Keep in mind his upbringing  an ESFP spoiled rotten and brimming from privilege  small loan of a million dollars  his father s inheritance  will get to pretty much anyone s head  I don t think in the course of his life  unfortunately  he had the chance to get a normal life or childhood  and we should take that into consideration  ESTP is definitely my second choice though ,estp
Why isn t there a single comment explaining  w  ,estp
To the people who vote ESTP  You do know that ESTPs have Fe function in their ego right  Fe is the function that makes you sensitive to other peoples feelings and makes you someone who is strongly oriented on social norms and ethics  Do you really think that this applies to Donald Trump ,estp
The  w s are completely stereotyping and don t even know what a social   is like  This man is a social    According to Beatrice Chestnut    The Social Three has a desire to be seen and to have influence with people  This three acts out in vanity through the desire to shine before the whole world  Social Threes enjoy being on stage  This subtype is the most vain of the Threes  and the biggest chameleon   The name given to this subtype is  Prestige   which reflects the idea of needing everybody s admiration and applause  This Three  more than the other two subtypes  likes and needs to be recognized  so they tend to be more out in front  basking in the spotlight  As children  it was typically important for Social Threes to  show  something  to look good and demonstrate competence in doing things  to get love  Support most likely came in the form of an approving  look  from parents    Sound familiar   And I get the  s are because he wants power  but social threes want power too  The reasons are different  s fight because they fear being out of control   s do because they fear not being noticed and being forgotten  Social  s want attention  And this man is all about attracting attention and hates not being noticed    The Social Three is very concerned with competition and winning  This is the most competitive Three  They are also focused on power  whether or not they are the one who has it  They tend to be demanding and authoritarian  though these characteristics may be hidden behind a presentation that is smooth  decorous  and humorous  Social Threes may view others in terms of how they potentially further or block the process of reaching their goals  They look at things in terms of how they can exert control over them  and they don t allow themselves to be surprised by life   The Social Three is also the most aggressive of the Threes  possessing a strong and assertive character  Because they are good at numbing out their feelings  they can   in the extreme   be cold    So stop mistyping  Social  s are the justice fighters and extremely social  fighting for others how is this man one   He does have an    personality  but remember that the second fix in the tritype is more your personality while the first one is your core fears ,estp
His behavior is consistent and compatible with the Myers Briggs  SJ  category type  albeit the unhealthy characteristics  as he appears to display a refusal to accept new information as seen when he rejected the scientific evidence for climate change  He also still seems to be holding on to domestic and arguably sexist beliefs  He still promotes somewhat archaic principles of nationalization such as  America first   and implements the same strong traditional values of the Trump family name as observed in his Father  Federick Trump Sr  and Son  Donald Jnr   Trump also appears to use external logical criteria as a measurement of his success  He makes decisions driven by status  leadership  wealth  popularity e t c to dictate his values and beliefs  which is indicative of Extroverted Thinking  Te   And observing the manner in which he handles his extensive business dealings and multiple side ventures   which almost always ends up with his name on every infrastructure   leads me to believe that he is an Extroverted Dominant Thinking personality type  And so my personal verdict would be ESTJ ,estp
What I ve noticed is that the arguments for SEE usually post a description of SLEs relating to structure and say  Trump doesn t seem like that   I haven t seen any good arguments for SEE that make use of actual information elements  I on the other hand have posted two arguments in detail that actually make use of information elements and detailed accounts of Donald Trump s life and time in office  that are not surface level  If someone can provide me an actual argument for SEE that uses information elements instead of descriptions and surface level character traits  I d be happy to consider it  Just consider as you scroll down that when you see an SEE argument that is based on surface level traits and where about     of the comment is just copy pasting a description from the internet  and yes this is a dig at Kashif s comment right below mine  that there are two arguments above which  however convincing or unconvincing you may find them  actually use information elements in their analysis ,estp
I think considering DCNH  it s at least certain that Trump is the D subtype  as it s the most established and achieving example for all the types  With that taken into account  I ll be posting descriptions of both SEE and SLE D to compare what fits better    SLE D  This subtype is a strong willed  determined  goal oriented person who is aggressively ambitious and demanding  Being energetic and active  he grows up developing uncommon ways of doing things  He achieves his goals by any means possible and is able to make enormous sacrifices in resources for his cause  He operates both directly and through intermediaries  He knows how to manage people  imposing his will on weaker parties  or offering favorable conditions where possible  He is quite proud  but sensitive  although he tries to conceal this  Considering it a weakness  it is unthinkable for him  In anger  he is insensitive to other people s shortcomings  He is a natural leader  though failing to overcome obstacles lowers his vitality  Configured for achieving realistic targets  as flexible a tactician  he is able to adapt to the process  He never hesitates taking risks  weighing chances of success on the fly  He will not rest till his targets are reached  He dislikes indecisive people who evade bold action  He rejects advice  preferring to make all decisions on his own  He can listen while conversing  but has to have the last word  Bureaucrats are intolerable to him  When under pressure  his resistance is even stronger   SEE D  This subtype possesses leadership characteristics  He exhibits good organization and also fulfills his word  He is better at managing large teams  as opposed to smaller ones  He is energetic and impulsive  but able to restrain himself around others  He looks presentable and respectable  SEE cultivates the image of a guardian fighting for the rights of a group of people  He cleverly lobbies the interests of his group  He constantly expands his circle of acquaintances and areas of activity  For him  it is important to be influential  having authority in the various circles he is in contact with  He knows how to mobilize people for new business  although not in convergence  He s unafraid of initial difficulties and has a tendency to rapidly move profitable ideas into practice  Tactically flexible  he improvises in accordance with the course of events  He rapidly adapts to extreme situations and looks for methods to stabilize situations  at least temporarily  SEE is definitely committed to never taking sides publicly and is good at negotiating  bringing opposing parties to a compromise  He acts confidently and decisively  but only if surrounded by support  He seeks a lot of formal council  making decisions independently after assessing the relation of forces among stakeholders  In the interest of business  he may become very demanding and  at times  even rigid  He is good at selecting assistants for himself SEE always knows what he wants  He needs big goals and new  challenging tasks  Without a constant influx of new ideas  his spirit sours  At the same time  he lacks strategy and long term calculation  He prefers to solve emerging problems immediately  otherwise  he may become distracted and lose interest  He is able to seek  and more importantly  unravel talents  Fortunately  this is popular among creative people seeking to be discovered  Thanks to him  society has enhanced social mobility  however  the implementation of excessive and badly prepared liberalization often leads to unhealthy competition and breakdown  He strives to be involved in the course of various events and loves to move from place to place  leaving each visit having made useful connections  At heart  he needs admiration and recognition  so when it is given  he doesn t spare any energy  This stimulates him for even greater activity  for him  it is very important to have his prestige recognized and acknowledged  SEE is indifferent to theory and engages purely in practical activities  He prefers specific attainable goals that will bring real benefit  He tries to improve his expertise in various fields in order to raise his prestige and strengthen his position  He finds it important to have a variety of titles and awards  He makes decisions based on personal experience  although if the issue isn t familiar to him  his choices fluctuate  He prefers to hide his inner thoughts and fears from others  In such situations  he seeks the advice of experts  He appreciates those who supply him with systematic information and warning of errors   Note that these are healthy descriptions  Based on this  I think he definitely fits SEE D better  Socio Ti is a little too lexical and structure oriented to fit someone like Trump  whose initiatives mostly pander to values and direct efficiency instead of a technically ideological one  I see the emphasis on  values  to be more of an indication of Fi over Ti too  and considering his entrepreneurial focus  Te value is extremely obvious,estp
The OG chad himself   Pure Se dom quite adaptable  opportunistic and enjoy the present moment   Strong Ti aux high IQ who is astute and  manipulates  logical consistency for his own experiment   Sophisticated Fe tert who cares about validation and makes him easily understand the tribe emotions  Distorted Ni inf who makes him megalomaniac  inspired and unable to thinks about consequences,estp
A correct and somewhat restrained manner of interaction is characteristic of the SLE  If logical component is emphasized  the communication is more relaxed  less inhibited  with smiles and expressions of positive emotions  The SLE often greets people first  Doesn t directly express his opinion on a topic of discussion  Tries to positively predispose a person towards himself with attentiveness and sensitivity  asks many questions  inquires about their problems  voices a wish to hear his or her opinions  All of this is done in a delicate  correct form  which very much predisposes people to give him answers  In a dialogue  the following moment is characteristic of this sociotype  After the replica of his conversation partner  the SLE makes a pause  as if thinking things over  trying to comprehend the information and provide the needed answer  During this deliberation he tends to squint his eyes  Another peculiarity of his manner of communication   is no fear in showing his ignorance or lack of understanding of some question  The SLE doesn t hesitate to ask  and re ask  and to clarify things once again  When he is giving an explanation  he does so slowly  with logical prioritization  explaining everything in terms of simple examples from practical experience  For the purposes of type diagnosis  SLE s way of finishing up a discussion is also noteworthy  Once he has given everyone the opportunity to speak  he expresses himself  as if giving a summary of the discussion  Keeps the last word for himself  If necessary  he can  put a person into a puddle   crush him with one remark or phrase said at the right time   Eh  to be frankly honest  I didn t see this kind of tendency in Donald Trump ,estp
Ok ok hear me out  He ESTP masked himself as an ENTJ just like Obama ENTP masked himself as an ENFJ,estp
Is he really a social    They re supposed to be nurturers and protectors  and defend marginalised groups  They are aggressive to exploitation and injustice  and people with power attacking less powerful groups  Wether you agree with him or not  you can agree he does the opposite of that  He plays on American s suspicion and prejudice to garner support by targeting specific  marginalised groups such as mexicans  That s the opposite of protecting the underdog   unrelated but pretty wild how people complained about JK Rowling being at the top of trending but not him  He s definitely more controversial  ,estp
I don t really see Trump as an   ,estp
Donald Trump is a social    not an    The whole reason he wanted to become president was to gain prestige  He slaps his family name on every building  every organization he creates  He was completely distraught and in denial when he lost the      election  He s      an image type  People are voting  w  based on stereotypes of him being    angry  The social   is named  Prestige  which pretty exactly describes Trump  sx is next in his stacking because sx  s tend to be more charismatic and intense  sp   is not like Trump at all  He has a   wing because he is more concerned with his individuality and need to stand out over his need to feel useful to those around him  Please fix this enneagram mistype   ,estp
I don t particularly see SLE for the same reason  I am not convinced of ENTJ  He talks about structure  but fails to back this up  His style is much more chaotic than someone with strong Ti  from a socionic perspective   Also  he is the sort of person who talks about firing people all the time on TV  but apparently can t bring himself to fire people in person irl    BTW  I had another comment on here that was deleted because I said Trump was an INFJ because he was just like Hitler  and I guess this community is supposed to be positive  which I can admire  I want to apologize because I was just trying to make a friendly joke that I thought was too absurd to be taken seriously  I want to clarify my position  just because Trump is an INFJ does not mean he is like Hitler  Not every INFJ is like Hitler  Some INFJs are like Hitler  some are like Trump  and some are even the author of Harry Potter  Trump might be an INFJ  but he is also completely unique  and I don t think that uniqueness can be denied regardless of your politics   Edit  I was frustrated with enneagram when I wrote this  but it may be more accurate to say that I m skeptical of people s abilities to type enneagram correctly if it really is about core motivations and fears ,estp
I can see why people type him SLE because he s apparently Beta  but when you put his actions and motivations under a microscope  he doesn t really seem to care much about hierarchy and structure  He seems to only be concerned about whether or not HE S in charge and how others can get him there  Beta leaders tend to have a deeply entrenched inner circle  whereas Trump has a revolving door of people who might be useful to him at any given moment  I also think he creative Fi is apparent with his rallies and speeches  he very much thrives on demonstrations of public approval and gets swept up in the roar of the crowd  Betas  even Beta ST s  embody the persona of a spirited visionary  whereas Trump appears as almost a prisoner to the demands of his supporters ,estp
Part of me likes him for ENTJ with just undeveloped Ni  I ll keep him as ESTP though  I ve also considered ESFP  I could see people confusing his narcissistic need for attention with Fe  The biggest issue with Te dom is that I don t think he has much interest in providing structure for his white house  He kinda thrives  or at least thinks he thrives  on complete chaos  I do agree that he s an  w   but don t see that as very insightful  That s probably my whole issue with the system in the first place  The loud bully is    the artist is a    the intelligent nerd is a    and the moral activist is a    It feels rather surface level ,estp
Alright  I ll try to summarize my  way too  long argument for SLE over SEE   My sources of info about Donald Trump include a large variety of old interviews  my general knowledge that comes from being a political junkie with an internet addiction  and   books I ve read about Trump  those being  Fear  and  Rage  by Bob Woodward   Too Much and Never Enough  by Mary Trump  and  Disloyal  by Michael Cohen   First of all  Donald Trump is clearly very confident in practical management  Throughout the Woodward books Trump refuses to take advice on how to handle practical economic or virus related matters  for example his rejection of free trade despite his advisors  attempts to convince him  his refusal to listen to disease experts like Fauci who have more experience and knew better than he did   How does strong Te fit with his track record of failed business ventures  Several reasons  First of all  Trump is an undisciplined spoiled brat  He didn t care enough to actually put in the work to run his businesses  preferring to jump into new business ventures on a whim  Trump doesn t care enough about maintaining his businesses to succeed  This is not just a sign of being undisciplined but it is also a sign of unvalued Te  Second of all  a lot of Trump s failed projects like the Trump board game  Trump steaks  etc  were failed attempts to promote his brand  and those sorts of failures came after he had already  made it   He only got into branding and promoting his braggadocios and abrasive personality later in life  which is far more consistent with mobilizing Fe  Meanwhile the fact that he failed so massively at branding attempts is also very much indicative of weaker Fe as opposed to stronger Fe   That brings us to his Fe  It s very clear that Trump is far more motivated by Fe than by anything else except Se  He is someone who loves to revel in an emotional atmosphere  who needs a constant hit of rallies where he often just says whatever comes into his mind  According to one news story  behind the scenes the Trump campaign offered to make John Kasich VP and then allow him to run the country while Trump continued doing rallies  When Trump initially rejected John Bolton  a guy with lots of experience and knowledge  it was because John Bolton didn t project the right image  Fe   Te   However Trump is also clearly not that strong in Fe  Trump doesn t know how to appeal to people except his own base  He was never as persuasive as people with  d Fe like Obama and Bill Clinton  During his      campaign he had no emotional message beyond a smattering of populist rhetoric  until Steve Bannon  EIE  arrived to take over his campaign  Steve Bannon told Trump how to appeal to people  gave him the exact talking points he needed to appeal to the rust belt and to take down Hillary Clinton   In addition  people point to Trump s inconsistency as proof of PoLR Ti  however that does not exactly hold up under scrutiny  Donald Trump adjusts his beliefs based on what will get him applause or get him what he wants  yet going back to before his political career and looking at older interviews Trump would often be asked his opinion on foreign policy  god knows why  and back then his view was very consistent  He has consistently believed that the US is allowing other countries to rip us off by allowing us to protect them  then flooding our markets  all without paying us  He constantly said that we needed to charge them for our protection  In fact  these views carried over into his political career  forming the basis of his America First ideology  As for domestic issues  sure Trump lied shamelessly during his campaign but he was still very ideologically consistent in his anti immigration and anti interventionist rhetoric  He continued all of this in his presidency as well  attempting  for example  to pull anti missile systems out of South Korea because they were expensive and attempting to leave Afghanistan before he was stopped by his cabinet in both circumstances  Frankly I m no fan of Donald Trump but his inconsistency is overblown   Lastly  Fi PoLR also seems very obvious  Trump has no         clue how to work with people and build bridges  He views every interaction with someone who is not working for him or supporting him through a very oppositional lens  unwilling to and incapable of finding common ground and working WITH people instead of AGAINST them  This is a feature he shares in common with other SLEs like Vladimir Lenin and Benjamin Netanyahu   To summarize  Trump is very confident in Te but does not care about it at all  he is more internally consistent  though not necessarily consistent with reality  than people give him credit for  showing a clear unchanging foreign policy even back in the   s  is strongly motivated by Fe yet clearly weak in Fe  and is incapable of finding a middle ground and working with others  ie  incapable of using Fi   SLE fits Trump far better than SEE  To be more specific he is SLE Se subtype ,estp
That   phlegmatic dom vote   ,estp
 When you are wronged repeatedly  the worst thing you can do is continue taking it  fight back     I try to learn from the past  but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present  That s were the fun is    These are such Se Ti things to say  Where is his Te Ni  ENTJ voters ,estp
Trump is definitely an ESTP  in kind of an obvious and stereotypical way  materialistic  cares a lot about his social status  always thinks he s right no matter what   these traits are much heightened in him due to his narcissism   Don t know why some people vote ENTJ  there s literally no Ni in him  Te is also not one of his strengths as he tends to dismiss objective data and follows his own rationale and understanding of things  P  S  I have a YT channel about the MBTI types of celebrities and movie characters  If you would like to check it out  here is the link to my recent video  Kim Kardashian analysis   I m currently working on a Kardashians series     Any kind of support would be much appreciated as I m just starting out   ,estp
The reason I m voting   over   is that as much as he outwardly and consciously cares about his image  when it comes to his actual behavior  his need for power and getting his own way almost always takes over  Fanbase aside  he is almost completely unable to adapt his behavior to what will make him look good  The minute something happens that threatens his sense of power  all that goes right out the window  no matter how much it damages his image  An example would be his various speeches in response to Charlottesville  Someone focused on image first would have left it at speech   ,estp
Donald Trump  VFLE   V  Donald Trump is someone who knows what he wants and refuses to take no for an answer  He hates everyone who gets in the way of what he wants    F  Donald Trump likes to show off his accomplishments through physical objects  shoving his name in giant gold letters on his buildings  decorating his apartments and estates and      in very ostentations  and gold  colors  constantly promoting himself to make his name synonymous with luxury and material success  He also indulges in physical desires very often  most notably junk food and sex  He enjoys putting on a good show and showing others a good time  primarily as an expression of how rich and powerful he is    L  Trump strongly dislikes engaging in logical or theoretical discussion  He is a man of action who won t attempt making logical or abstract points even when his job depends on it  In presidential debates and interviews he refuses to discuss things logically or coherently and instead relies on pure bravado to get his points across    E  Donald Trump is decidedly uninterested in his emotions or the emotions of others  He doesn t care if he offends anyone or hurts their sensibilities  Quite a few people were drawn to Trump because he  triggered the libs   Trump will say the most wild things totally outside the realm of discourse  such as how Mexico is sending rapists to our country  things which elicit a strong negative emotional reaction from most people  Trump doesn t care  He is however receptive when other people suggest emotional things to him  for example his      campaign was lacking a clear emotional direction until Steve Bannon  VELF  joined and offered Trump a clear long term emotional message to give to voters  which saved his      campaign ,estp
Trump is obviously an INFJ  He may seem rough around the edges  but he s doing that thing INFJs do where they try to build a wall just to see who truly cares enough to tear those walls down ,estp
im so sorry to all ESTPs for having the same mbti as him and to all ISTPs for him being ur extroverted version   i love xSTPs not this orange tho x,estp
guys he s obviously ENFJ   fe  was able to manipulate millions of people into worshiping him and covering their houses in his merch  as we ALL know  only dominant fe users are manipulative   ni  he had a plan in his presidency to build a wall in the future   only strong ni users can do this obviously   se  he was able to give kevin the directions to the lobby in his ICONIC film home alone    good example of a fe se loop as he was using his se to help kevin  which is also an example of his obvious fe ofc   ti  because literally NOTHING this dude says makes sense  so this obviously means inferior ti   so yeah  this guy is an obvious ENFJ  why arent yall seeing it     ,estp
This guy head is completely Se Ni this guy decide coming to North Korea when they actually hate US lmao and nah I m not buying Ne he got literally a SeTi mindset talking about coronavirus Si inferior nah I m good you are telling me his reckless ideas from the start stir up controversy of how dense this guy Se are making his enemies right from the start knowing them also in your country is the perfect ESTP mindset dumbasses can t even know the difference just stfu y all making me sick with all the mistype and sh t,estp
Ne  External intuition  he draws ideas from outside sources as opposed to internal  He s a visionary mastermind and tends to think ahead  some of you may disagree with me  and that s fine  Not every Ne user is perfect at it or gets it right      of the time   The amount of things he s done in his lifetime  from creating businesses  to running for presidency  to running the white house may also be an example of Ne  always having new ideas and going for it with the help of his enneagram   Ti  Internal logic  Taking new information and seeing if it correlates with what s already known  Ti is concerned with what works  what s efficient  and it doesn t have time for anything that holds the user back from moving forward  I think Trump was pretty dismissive of anything that didn t help drive his companies and the country back from being successful   Fe  External Feeling  We got to see tertiary Fe quite a bit in his presidency  His ability to connect with his voters and to get a reading on what the average American wants   Make America Great Again  was probably the most Fe slogan anyone could think of for a campaign    Si  Internal Sensing  Especially weak Si  will have difficulty accepting more  progressive  rules or ways  Things like that  things that are new and uncomfortable might be rejected  or in his case  scoffed at and mocked  Like it or not  Trump s main objective from the start was to go against  The establishment   which can be a mindset of a person with low Si in some cases    So yeah  i think he s ENTP  That s just me though    Edit  I also think Trump is a CP Type   It makes sense seeing as he s worked his entire life to ensure that he and his family would always be secure  Not to mention a counterphobic   typically get s mistaken for Type   because of their dauntless behavior   I d also like to point out that when   moves towards its growth arrow  it adopts positive traits of a healthy Type    More optimistic and calm  and when moving towards it s stress arrow  it can adopt negative traits of an unhealthy Type    Competitive and arrogant  which could be why a lot of people think that Trump is a Type   ,estp
Whoever thinks he is an ETJ need their head checked out Narcissism arrogance plus enneagram   will always look like they have no Fe  If you are going to type him then look at his first   functions first not Tertiary or inferior  And as we can see there is not much evidence of high Ni ,estp

We seem to be largely in agreement that trump is an SXUEN        votes    The point of contention is whether his neuroticism is above average         or below average          Let s look at the six neo pi r facets for neuroticism   Anxiety  does trump strike anyone as being particularly anxious  His  shoot from the hip and who cares who gets offended  approach to public speaking would seem to suggest otherwise  Hostility anger  yeah he seems to score fairly high on this one  I actually think he s pretty good at keeping his cool but there s a clear aggression and irritability underlying his interactions with everyone who opposes him  Depression  I see absolutely no indication of this trait in Trump whatsoever  Self consciousness  depends on what we mean by self consciousness  Given that it s presented as a trait of neuroticism I m guessing it means something akin to  social awkwardness   another trait which trump doesn t seem to exhibit to any noticeable degree  Impulsiveness immoderation  well his weight alone suggests immoderation  I think the way he seemed to lash out at reporters and hire and fire staff like it was no big deal suggests that he s pretty impulsive  Vulnerability to stress fear learned helplessness  yet another trait where trump demonstrates no indications whatsoever   Although Trump scores somewhat highly on hostility and impulsiveness I would say he scores extremely low on the other four facets  In the aggregate it looks to me that his neuroticism is comfortably in the below average category   He s SCUEN not SLUEN ,estp
Hate to say this because my typing is already similar enough to him as it is but   are we sure he isn t another so  so  mistyping ,estp
Another Three mistyped as an Eight   This guy is obviously a Three  he s so afraid of looking like a failure  being seen as inferior  and therefore sinking his effort into doing things to look prestigious and trying to fit in with other rich people  but due to his incredibly strong narcissistic tendencies  he only ends up talking about himself  He can put on a show for people though  He seems to have  or at least had  some ability to connect with people  whether this was by fluke  which is likely  since he doesn t show that much strategy   or by a natural affinity to identify what other people want  I m leaning on the former  it was a fluke  which seems to become more apparent by how he took his loss  Rather than moving on  and re grouping for       he whines constantly  and still does about how the election was rigged and  No I didn t lose   he cheated    and then he goes on to lose over    court cases about election fraud  yet still keeps up the charade  even after it s obvious to everyone who isn t a sycophant that he lost  His biggest nightmare was losing his Twitter account  He wants constant media attention  he wants the camera on him to show to the world how important he is  Another tendency of narcissism    Subtype is a mixture of the Social    The Brand Builder   and the Sexual    The High Roller   Definitely not the humblebraggy  hardworking Three  Self Preservation     Trump loves the sensations that come with fame and wealth  and worked as much as he could to keep the facade strong  Living the life of luxury matches most with the Sexual    He loves the intensity that comes with wealth  he gets around a bit  he uses his wealth as a privilege  making moves on people without them wanting it  When you re a star  they let you do anything  He also loves marketing  brand building  his name became an icon associated with wealth and prestige  pointing to some of those Social   tendencies  He also doesn t really tell the truth very much  he s got to keep the facade of success up as much as he can  With Trump I get the impression he doesn t care as much about actual power  as he does the aesthetics of power and privilege  He likes to look large and in charge  he lies about his net worth pretending to be his assistant  John Barron   He plated one of his skyscrapers in gold  he had gold sinks in his planes  Trump is almost a living parody of a billionaire  despite probably not even being one   I think being President was the worst thing that happened to him  He has put himself under the most powerful microscope known to man  and now he s paying the price  In seeking prestige and status  he has put himself in a place where everything he does will be subject to scrutiny  knowing that he s been involved in some well    let s just say  shady  activity ,estp
       Not an ENTJ   https   www youtube com watch v  TwVCuPJrMw   I live very much for the moment  i think the future is very important but the moment is here  you don t know if you re gonna be in the future   Ni is the most future focused function  The Fe is clear too    He has  a phenomenal understanding of people      He knows exactly what to say to different people to put them at ease  ,estp
I don t think Donald Trump is a social    but instead an sp    here s why    The Social Eight countertype uses their power and influence in the service of others  making them appear Two ish in their drive to support others rather than asserting their own needs  Sensitive to injustice and unfair social norms  they are loyal and protective and shield  their people  from harm  unjust authority or abuse of power  Even though they prefer not to be too vulnerable  they invite and appreciate tough feedback from close allies     The SP Eight is strong  direct and productive and appears powerful and effective  Confident in even the most challenging situations  they are survivors and are pillars of strength for many as they take the role of guardian  father or mother figure  When their needs are not satisfied  they become frustrated and intolerant  and tend to take a direct  no nonsense approach to get what they want  without guilt or apology   source     Self Preservation Eights express the passion of lust through a focus on getting what they need for survival  SP Eights have a strong desire for the timely satisfaction of material needs and an intolerance for frustration  SP Eights know how to survive in difficult situations and feel omnipotent when it comes to getting what they need  They are the least expressive and the most armed of the three Eight subtypes     Social Eights express lust and aggression in the service of others  A social antisocial person  this is the countertype of the Eights  a helpful Eight who appears less aggressive and more loyal than the other two Eight subtypes  The name  Solidarity  emphasizes their tendency to offer help when people need protection   source    definitely sounds more SP to me ,estp

Narcissism     Fi  morons  And don t you think an ESFP of his age would actually have well developed Te  Trump is a selfish piece of      who doesn t give two sh  s about authenticity  self reflection  internal awareness  or moral value  all of which are a big part Fi  He just tells his worshippers whatever they want to hear and lies through his teeth to further his goals  He wants to be a god in the eyes of the public because he craves that external validation to feed his ego  he has an Fe cult leader mentality  He doesn t make most of his external judgements through statistics  inductive reasoning  or impersonal objectives the same way that a well developed Te user would  He basis all of his external judgements in accordance to whatever the alt right want him to say and do  and in return he gets to be lauded as their lord and saviour  Fe god complex right there   What kind of Te user tells easily refutable lies every other sentence just to keep their fanbase happy  Trump has s  t Fi and Te ,estp
He has no clue about what is appropriate to say and the way people will react to the things he say  his narcisissm comes from unhealthy fi  and the way he approaches the world and business is classic Te   he s too impulsive to have auxiliary ti,estp
Gonna echo other sentiments here  While I don t think Trump is an    he s clearly     if he is an   he isn t a social    Probably sexual    possibly self preservation    The Social Eight countertype uses their power and influence in the service of others  making them appear Two ish in their drive to support others rather than asserting their own needs  Sensitive to injustice and unfair social norms  they are loyal and protective and shield  their people  from harm  unjust authority or abuse of power  Even though they prefer not to be too vulnerable  they invite and appreciate tough feedback from close allies      This absolutely does not describe Donald Trump at all  Even if you are someone who supports Trump and thinks he s fighting to help people  I don t   that doesn t change the fact that he was completely about himself and just himself until running for office  meaning the  social    part of his life only started when he was    years old   Again  I think Trump is a social    but if he were an   he absolutely would not be a social   ,estp
Competitiveness and status seeking tendency is not necessarily   if that status is a mean for power and control   Actually    s core tendency is their sensitivity about image  which seriously lacks for Trump  Trump   at least as I know   literally don t care about bad reputations made by medias and liberals  and just do things as he want   Unlike Hillary  who is voted as       https   www enneagraminstitute com misidentifying   and     Eights do not care about popularity  they do not care about the goodwill of others  so long as they get their way        If Eights are too busy achieving their purposes to worry about public opinion  Threes live and die on the opinions of others and desperately want to be in demand socially  If average Eights are combative and intimidating and can  take the heat   despite a certain bravado  average Threes will back down or be driven to deviousness  they cannot take pressure for long or exposure for a moment        Eights pay little attention to their image and care even less about how people perceive them  Instead  Eights are motivated by a desire for influence and power        Eights are more structure and systems focused  instinctively grasping structural and systems impacts  but they often have blind spots in the interpersonal arena     Eights often feel limited by organizational structures  can be rebellious toward authorities  and break the rules if it suits their purposes  Threes may at times also break rules  but they are more likely to subtly circumvent them than to violate them in a bold and visible way     Threes also tend to be more diplomatic than Eights and will speak       with a sensitivity to the impact their words have on another  for Threes  truth and honesty may be relative and somewhat contingent on particular circumstances  For Eights  there is no relative truth or honesty  They say what they think and expect others to do the same     The Threes  facility in adapting their persona to their context can leave them confused about their real or deeper identity  Eights  by contrast  adapt so little to their context that their sense of self does not shift and change to the same degree     Also   His blunt and hot tempered personality just means high extroversion and low agreeableness SxxEx   High neuroticism Limbic  actually means sensitivity to emotions like fear or depression  and since Trump totally lacks of it  I voted Calm instead of Limbic ,estp
Trump is an SP   for sure  People are voting social   but there is no way that is correct  Social   is the most distinctive    Social  s have big egos but their egos aren t that invested in themselves  Social  s channel aggression and anger into protecting people who the  s see as less capable of protecting themselves  You can disrespect a social   and mess with them a little bit and they ll be placid and might put up with somewhat  even with a   wing  But if you mess with one of a social   s  people  and they ll burn your house down  That s the opposite of Trump  Trump s ego is invested in Trump and  his people  can be sacrificed to that end  He s an SP for sure  It fits with his career in construction and building  He s all about THINGS  He s as materialistic as it gets which is why I type him as an  w  SP ,estp

I d call Donald Trump PoLR Fi in Socionics  He struggles to treat anyone modesty and respectfully  and he s okay with that  He uses other methods to procure support      It doesn t surprise me that there s a close argument between SEE and SLE  I have a hypothesis as to why that is  I think Donald Trump s an SLE Se  the SLE s Inert Subtype  I d call him an unhealthy one  though  I think Trump can sport so much Se that  sometimes  that s all we see in him   To make a sociotype into an Inert Subtype  you    strengthen the four Functions in the Inert Block  and    weaken the four Functions in the Contact Block    Therefore  the SLE Se is an SLE with strengthened Ethical and Sensory Information Elements and weakened Intuitive and Logical Information Elements  Such an SLE will still sport Beta Quadra values  but will  among them  be    more emotionally expressive     more forceful     less systematic  and    less foresightful    Wait  strengthened ethics in Trump    Yep  through his own eyes and passions  What he considers right and wrong isn t exactly what some people would consider ethical  but I needn t digress into that  opinions are opinions    Here are some quotes about the SLE Se that incisively depict Trump      Possesses a sense of humor  that easily molds into sarcasm and caustic irony  Talkative  charming  witty  critical and sharp       Can hold a grudge and be sufficiently resourceful to make the life of his ill wishers become intolerable       Knows how to be liked and how to please others  charming  possesses a sense of humor  a good conversationalist       Natural leader  needs competition  struggle  passion  victory  without these his vitality wanes       When angry shows intolerance towards other people s shortcomings  Knows how to give a brief and succinct description of a person  to ridicule him in presence of strangers  to put him on the spot       Very self loving and easily offended  but tries to hide it  considering this to be his weakness       Has a tendency to overestimate his abilities  which leads to arrogance and a wish to teach others  Self instilled confidence in his own rightness and insufficient self criticism do not simplify his relations with others       Sharp  demonstrative  attacking style of behavior  Can be expressive and expansive to the point of being aggressive     source      Donald Trump may seem to neglect Ti legality and Ti systemic adherence  but he actually exploits systems more than ignoring them  That s why he so frequently managed to snake his way out of legal repercussions despite doing unethical things  he knows the system and what he can get away with  Storming the White House  though  Well    that was just reckless    In Reinin Dichotomies  I guarantee that Donald Trump is an Aristocratic  Decisive type  a Beta Quadra member  specifically  the SLE       His Decisive qualities can be seen in his valuing of power and forceful competitiveness  Trump asserts himself to get his way  aiming to be a strong  confident doer who gets his way through raw willpower     His Aristocratic qualities come from him viewing people as members of social groups stratified into hierarchy  Trump uses these groupings to assert dominance over people  He always seeks to declare that he s above other people or that those people come from  inferior  groups  usually minority groups who ve never laid a finger on him      Also  I think Trump actually cares less about Gamma Quadra business profits than Beta Quadra reputation  social status  and hierarchy  His Ti valuing and Aristocratic partisanship encourage him to create a mental hierarchy of who s  the best     I can confidently identify Trump as an Se base type  SEE or SLE  in Socionics  and SLE Se s my current bet    If you  however  want to argue for SEE  I d recommend arguing for SEE Se  That d be your best bet    Thanks for reading     Time to roll the credits ,estp

Of course the man  who literally displays fake Time Magazine covers in some of his properties  wants you to believe he is   core  This is an insult to real ennea   presidents like Roosevelt and Polk    both of whom got      done instead of merely talking about it  Roosevelt got shot during a speech yet finished it and also cracked down on monopolies  Polk expanded the US and accomplished almost every campaign promise including serving only one term  What does Trump do  Balks on things his base would appreciate  such as       checks  surrendering to REPUBLICANS in Congress who wanted         this administration also was about to send   masks to each American household in April      but didn t because it would  cause panic   And this guy thinks he deserves another term because Obama  spied  on him  He is very self entitled and victim posing without actually having the record to back him up   Psychological analysis    He reminds me of my friend s mom  an ESFJ  w   also ESE I believe  who was quite abusive  One time the police was called on her  and what did she do when they arrived  Drop down to the floor and cry as if she was the victim of abuse from them  And she got away with it because she was old and frail  This is literally what Trump does  He takes advantage of Twitter and the media s over the top hatred for him and paints it as victimization  There is no better type for this than enneagram     James K  Polk    k checks   Masks at start of pandemic ,estp
Setting aside politics  I m typing him based off the way he communicates in interviews and the content of what he says  I believe he is an ENTJ that comes off a bit like an ESFP  which I think happens to some ENTJs as they get older  If you watch an interview when he was young you can see that he s leading with Te  he s focused on communicating decisively what he believes is objectively  externally  true  I m not sure why he s being typed as an ESTP because I really don t see any Ti or Fe in his stack  he doesn t value subjective  internal  logic nor does he alter his behaviour to what others or society think is moral  I do think he has strong Ni though  seems to think a lot about what is the ideal of the future is and how to put that into action  Te    Here s a good example of an interview of him when he was younger ,estp
any reasons for  w  over  w   not that i can t see both  but i think he s much more concerned with status and riches than having power or control his stint as president wasn t a bid for power  it was a vain publicity stunt gone wrong and under stress  he didn t become paranoid and start overthinking like an   disintegrating into    he simply took a back seat and let the country go out of control  like a   disintegrating into an unhealthy  ,estp
We didn t elect Duke Nukem  we elected Joseph Stalin   Here s some information on Stalin for comparison to Trump    Joseph Stalin launched a series of five year plans intended to transform the Soviet Union from a peasant society into an industrial superpower   Strong focus on domestic manufacturing  His development plan was centered on government control of the economy    heavy tariffs on China and  re naming  of NAFTA        forced collectivization also led to widespread famine across the Soviet Union that killed millions   Chose to save the economy over an extreme health crisis      Stalin ruled by terror and with a totalitarian grip in order to eliminate anyone who might oppose him   Threatened Republican leaders by not lending his support for their next election if they opposed him   He expanded the powers of the secret police  he greatly expanded ICE  While not on the levels of the secret police  deporting those who certainly won t vote for you is a start   encouraged citizens to spy on one another  this would be Qanon with the inclusion of rich  political people  and had millions of people killed or sent to the Gulag system of forced labor camps     Stalin instituted the Great Purge  a series of campaigns designed to rid the Communist Party  the military and other parts of Soviet society from those he considered a threat    You could argue that Trump trying to steal the election by spreading lies about the system and attempting to overthrow the government through the courts and even a physical attack on the Capitol is an extreme form of reaching for political power by unethical means     Additionally  Stalin built a cult of personality around himself in the Soviet Union  There is no doubt Trump created quite a positive image for himself doing not so positive things   Cities were renamed in his honor  Soviet history books were rewritten to give him a more prominent role in the revolution and mythologize other aspects of his life   I avoid taxes because I am smart   Like I mentioned before  he renamed the NAFTA agreement to make it look like his accomplishment  He s done this with a few policies   He was the subject of flattering artwork  literature and music  and his name became part of the Soviet national anthem    While never penetrating the national anthem  Trump certainly has a ton of art  such as music  memes  and symbolism that is depicted of his heroics and slogans     He censored photographs in an attempt to rewrite history  removing former associates executed during his many purges  His government also controlled the Soviet media    It s a good thing Trump can t sensor the internet  However  calling everything that you don t like  fake news  is one way to get your supporters to distrust the news  That s basically controlling the information yourself    The comparisons are shocking to me  And almost all of these examples are of Te Fi  Usually preferring Te to Fi   The economic way vs the moral way  really   Like I said  he s not a Duke Nukem  even if he is comfortable in Se   Source       This post had mod permission to be re uploaded based on it not violating comment guidelines    ,estp
Hes an ESFP  I could also see ISFP  however he just dosent seem as  contained  as an ISFP   A lot of people seem to think that Trumps characteristics comes from tertiary Fe and polar Fi  but it dosent   It rather comes from him not valuing Fe  and valuing Fi with Se instead  and then also valuing Te with Ni   All of this makes him seem very serious and business like   The thing with Trump  isnt that he dosent know how to act around others  which would indicate ESTP  but rather that he dosent care   For example an ESTP would probably say Trump lacks social grace  and his seriousness and unplayfullness would also be very off putting to an ESTP   For example in sosionics  ESI and SLE  which are kind of the sosionics versions of ISFP and ESTP  are made out to be a bad match  Some of the reason for this is that ISFP is made out to be very serious  and might therefore make the ESTP feel somewhat childish  The ESTP would feel like theyre stepping on eggshells around the ISFP  in order to not irritate the ISFP   This ISFP ish behaviour can be seen in Trump  and is a trait of gamma quadra  xNTJ and xSFP  rather than beta quadra  xSTP and xNFJ    Here are some clips that makes Trump seem very gamma like  like xNTJ and xSFP        Another thing is that Trump is very talkative and seems to have lived a lot of his life around people   For an ESTP  such a position would be very exhausting  For example it would be very exhausting for an ESTP to have workers under them  and then whenever the workers are slacking off  they have to go and shout at them to get them back to work    ESFPs have more emotional  ammunition  together with their Se aggresiveness  So for example for an ESFx  being in Trumps role would be far less exhausting     Ive also thought of ESTJ  however the issue again is that an ESTJ would probably be very exhauated of being in Trumps role  And Trump just seems too business practical   An ESTJ can get into things like for example sociology  pshycology and philosophy  which is a trait of Ne Fi   Trump dosen t seem like the kind of person that likes learning things just because its intresting   He seems rather very concerned about the practicality of stuff   He would probably judge such things as unpractical and therefore unintresting  This indictes Trump being a gamma  xNTJ and xSFP  rather than delta  xSTJ and xNFP  ,estp

What do you think bois  Does he display more use of Ti or Fe  I d probably call the Se Fe subtype  especially with the  L  apparently ,estp
I think a lot of the      he talks is Ni creative  He is decisive and makes connections using a strong hand  Declaring  positive and choleric  Not all LIE are this nuts but they all have very strong decisive opinions with weak Fi issues in having empathy  He does have an interesting sense of humor that is characteristic of LIE too   He will also do his job and push people and limits until he dies probably Si polr   Every intention is some form of plan and he s always pitching it  SEE and LIE are really good marketers  LIEs present it as an idea  the idea we are going with  SEE present it as some controversial but urgent morality that should have your support and decisiveness on   SxEs are more manipulative than LIEs  I wouldn t say what he does is manipulation  It s more dynamic force of opinion   If not LIE then SEE  although I think he is declaring not asking ,estp
I get strong unhealthy Fi vibes from this guy lol  The ESTP vote is quite perplexing,estp
Why socio SEE  Not SLE   I don t know much about Socionics ,estp
Where are people getting   core   I ve thought ENTJ and can completely understand that vote  but isn t the   core based in such stereotyping of his explosive tendencies   The man has such enneagram   motives  A television star that people call a billionaire is such an enneagram   thing   The reason I think  w  is because he feels the need to stand out and be his own unique individual based on his persona  He s less people pleasing than a  w  would be  in my mind  He cares more about his identity and how it is displayed which gives me more  w  leanings ,estp
He s ENTJ and it bothers me so very much that he s become one of the first examples people think of when they hear ESTP ,estp

Before voting him SLUEN  please read the below     Neuroticism C vs L  is a tendency to  feel  negative emotions  the tendency to express them is more about Agreeableness or Extroversion  Though he seems to be short tempered and express negative emotions directly because of his extremely low agreeableness and high extroversion  his tendency to feel them is utterly different matter   Besides  things gets much more obvious when we talk about facet  Anxiety  Anger  Depression  Self consciousness  Impulsivity  and Vulnerability  Though I agree that his anger and impulsivity is pretty high  all the other facets are very low  Does Trump get anxious when facing with danger  become depressive and discouraged  get embarrassed in front of crowd  experience panic under pressure  As I remember  trump was the direct opposite    Also   when you take Big five test on IDRLabs     Being low in neuroticism may thus be perceived as desirable but  on the other hand  extremely low levels of neuroticism may also predispose a person for being too carefree and liable to underestimate potential threats in their environment   I think it shows the reason of Trump s failure  he was confident  but also too insensitive to danger like COVID     ,estp
yall are just voting him   off of stereotypes  his core desires are for success and to be admired  he s clearly an unhealthy  ,estp
I think Trump is Choleric Sanguine  not Choleric dom   He looks like Choleric dom on TV in debates and when dealing with Democrats on TV  but watching him interacting with other people besides those he views as his enemy Trump is a very jovial and social person who genuinely enjoys social interaction just for its own sake  Watching him interact with other people he loves to make jokes  often without any filter  and just have fun  If you ve ever seen him on TV with a leader or politician he genuinely likes he comes across as a very stereotypical childish Sanguine type  Look at his interactions with Emanuel Macron  dubbed by many as the  Trump whisperer   or look at his interactions with Narendra Modi  or how he was when his relationship with Kim Jong Un started turning more positive  Another example of his Sanguine side taking over that doesn t involve world leaders  was when he was meeting with some nurses and hospital staff about COVID  one guy was talking about how he s worried about the post traumatic stress of dealing with COVID patients every day  and Trump decides to start handing out pens to everyone  It was pretty awkward lol   Donald Trump is a very social person and a natural entertainer and salesman  both of which are quite indicative of Sanguine   Also  if even half of the stories in this reddit compilation video are true  I think it provides even more evidence    Trump is a narcissist for sure  but I can say from watching a lot of him on the news  as well as reading many articles  watching a documentary  and reading both of Bob Woodward s books about Trump   Fear  and  Rage   as well as Michael Cohen s memoir  Disloyal   in daily life he s not  just  the brutish         we see on TV ,estp
Could somebody explain why his engram is  w  instead of  w   He does everything for personal gain so I guess my small mind sees him as more of a  w  ,estp
he stands out too much to be so sx  plus people either love him or hate him  that seems very sx so and i think people are voting him so dominant because he s a politician  he has this divide and conquer thing that most sx so s have  where you get accepted into a position and then get people to be on your side  he is splitting up and dividing the white house in my opinion  i would love to hear other s answer ,estp
i have a legit question  how is he w    he s not even self reflective at all nor is he as introverted as a w   id say hes probably  wb or  w  in all honesty ,estp
There a very few people you can find an agreed consensus of a type  but Trump is an almost perfect example of ESTP  w   full ennea tri type probably        w    w    w ,estp
ES Ps can be both awful  Donald Trump  George W  Bush  James Buchanan  and great presidents  Ronald Reagan  JFK  Theodore Roosevelt   No clue which one Bill Clinton is  but he exists too ,estp
Trump s actions and decisions are completely determined by his feelings       of the time  He contradicts himself left and right and rarely  if ever  makes any attempt to explain himself in ways that make good logical sense  This alone is a clear indication that he does not value Ti in the slightest  I genuinely can t comprehend why anyone would type this man as an ESTP  who  in theory  should have very proficient Ti usage  comparable to that of a Ti dominant  ESTPs can be stupid  but they re not illogical and should at least be able to articulate themselves to other people  Trump never even makes an effort to do this  and when he s asked to he can t even make an argument without justifying it with some sort of hunch or personal feeling  Fi Ti  He s stubborn in his beliefs even when all evidence is working against him  in other words  he doesn t actually care about being correct  just feeling like he s correct  Again  Fi Ti   To the ENTJ voters  some of you make very good arguments  but Trump s nature is simply too sporadic for him to be a heavy Te user  He doesn t make consistent effort to be thorough in his objectives  which I admit is a bit stereotypical  but it s true of xNTJs in general  The weird conviction he has in his own far fetched conspiracies  to me at least  indicates weak and undeveloped Ni  not that of an Ni aux  and a self righteous Fi judgement ,estp
How can such a man have Ti  the most accurate and precise of all the functions ,estp
I think an ENTJ would be more cautious about making inappropriate comments regarding his own daughter on television ,estp
Trump  A Te dom  An Fi user  That s funny   ,estp
Most of this argument for Trump being SLE is copy pasted from a conversation in a reply below  so if the format is weird or you feel like some context is missing  that s why  Copy pasting is more convenient than re writing an argument   Trump has no sense of loyalty  Sure  Fi creative is more flexible than Fi in any other spot because the creative function is flexible  but SEE s still do focus on maintaining relationships with people  Trump fires and takes on people on a whim based on who makes him feel good  Fe  or who is useful for his goals  FFS Mike Pence was the most loyal person Trump has ever had and Trump was still giddy during the insurrection as the crowds were chanting  hang Mike Pence    To be clear  this wasn t a vindictive thing  which would be Fi   Se   Trump wasn t happy about the crowd wanting to hang Mike Pence  he was just happy about the crowd storming the capitol  He didn t give a      about Mike Pence  Apparently Trump and Mike Pence have already made up   And yes  creative Fi is flexible and  as you said  hot and cold  but it is still Fi blocked with Se  SEEs remember past slights and are quick to cut off people they dislike   In addition  Trump is clearly an Fe Ni valuing type in Socionics  Very image focused  all about the brand  This is seen in politics and business  In business  he was always trying to project his brand as a brash  successful dealmaker  It wasn t just that he was that  he needed everyone to know he was that  He was constantly putting his name on everything  He turned his name into a brand  He  Turned  His  Name  Into  A  Brand   Clear focus on evoking emotions over the long term  Fe Ni   However  this sort of focus developed later on in his life after he had been established  Early on he was more dry and business focused  His focus on Fe developed later on  as it would for mobilizing Fe   In politics  Trump absolutely loved the rallies and the applause and the cheering  There s one story of how  in       his campaign approached John Kasich to say  paraphrased   How about Trump chooses you to be VP and you run the country while Trump continues doing rallies n          Trump loves his nicknames that he chooses  Lyin  Ted  Little Marco  Crooked Hillary  Sleepy Joe  Crazy Bernie  It s a focus on attaching labels to people to create an emotional reaction but as you and I know  Trump isn t exactly a master strategist  Even if you like Trump  IDK your political views  it s clear he isn t a long term planner  He used the nicknames because he wanted to   In Fear  Trump in the White House  when Trump needed to get a new National Security Advisor  he interviewed John Bolton  who had experience and expertise  but Trump didn t like Bolton because of his  big  bushy mustache  He didn t look the part    Quote from the book   Trump wanted a military man  He ended up choosing Army Lieutenant General H R  McMaster   A Te mobilizing SEE would have appreciated Bolton s experience and knowledge  but Trump didn t because he wanted someone who would project the image Trump wanted   In fact  throughout the book Trump shows a clear disregard for other people s knowledge and expertise  believing he knows better  When his advisors which he specifically chose and who have experience and knowledge dealing with certain subjects such as trade  Trump constantly disagrees with them and refuses to take their advice  believing he knows better  When asked why he believes he s right  he says he has always believed in this policy and just knows he s right  This disregard for experience  knowledge  etc  in favor of his own shows a clear disregard of Te  An SEE would have weak but valued Te  They know they aren t great but are eager to learn and take advice on practical matters from other people who are better at practical stuff than they are  If Trump were Te mobilizing  he would not have shown disregard for other people s Te advice  He would have accepted their practical advice eagerly   Trump s assumption that he knows what s best in practical business matters  regardless of whether he actually does or not  is much more consistent with Te demonstrative  as it s something he is fully confident in and is unconcerned with other people s advice on practical issues    Part   in reply  I m out of room here ,estp
Limbic  Really  L is supposed to indicate high neuroticism  You really think trump is neurotic  I always assumed his neuroticism was pretty low  He doesn t seem pre disposed towards depression and his mood  though irascible  tends to be pretty consistent and not particularly erratic  If you re thinking  C means calm and trump doesn t seem very calm so he must be an L  then that s not really how the system works   Edit  this SLOAN voting system needs updating  At time of writing   people have voted C and only   have voted L and yet he is still listed as SLUEN because the   L votes are all SLUEN whereas the   C votes are dispersed amongst other types  This is not the correct way to apply the Big Five  That approach may make sense with the MBTI  where you need to consider each type as an indivisible unit because it implies certain cognitive functions   The big five however is meant to be totally granular with one trait implying nothing about any of the other traits  If most users think Trump has low neuroticism then he should be listed as a C  not an L ,estp
his  rd function of fe is shown to his supporter cult  and uses se and ti to navigate himself  manipulator  kinda like ryan from the office but ryan isn t this chaotic and stupid  his twitter HAHAHAH  and the ways he speaks is influenced of se ti ,estp
undeniable  w   some have argued core    but i do not see it at all  while both  s and  s can be assertive and aggressive   s will still try to look put together and successful for other people s approval  Trump can try to claim or talk about being for the people all he wants  he ultimately  in my opinion  does not care for his image or success and is instead trying to become the most powerful and untouchable  this is the keen difference between the core   who wants to be the embodiment of successful and desirable traits of their chosen identity  and a core    who is trying to be the most powerful in order to control situations and to keep away from being controlled by others  compare the image values of a   of wanting to know how they re being perceived  what kind of attention they want and need  how others think of them versus gut values of an   who wants to assert their presence  be in control of their independence  desire their own autonomy and control over their own destiny and selves  i do not see anything core  ish or image triad about Trump considering all of the points i ve listed ,estp

At the beginning of his CPAC speech he was uncharacteristically reclusive and a bit more hesitant  We hadn t heard much from him since he left the Oval Office  so that has me thinking some degree of      disintegration is taking place  especially since once he got a feel for the crowd he  warmed up  to his usual speech  Also he just flat out said that SCOTUS didn t have  the guts or the courage to do anything about  the      election  which sounds more   like than   like   But TBH his entire term as President  especially on Twitter  points to   over   with how impulsive and unfiltered he was ,estp

I m reading Michael Cohen s book and between that and what I already know about him  yeah  I definitely think he s a   over an    He seems more image centric than actually wanting power  I don t think he cares if he has power as long as other people think he does  and that s the big difference here  He puts his name on everything  His homes are coated in excess  I m taking the book with a grain of salt but apparently he may or may not have spent thousands of dollars rigging an online poll of the most influential modern businessmen to get from    th to  th place and when he was removed they threatened to sue  His supposed net worth is constantly fluctuating  one moment he s worth   billion and the next he s worth    billion  I think he s clearly a   ,estp
Here s an interesting take on Trump s personality  https   www youtube com watch v tM  NRe  Qo  I m very tempted to choose  w  because of how aware he is of what others think say about him  as well as his skillful manipulation of the media and the words he makes them air  He tweets and talks so much about small things others say about him   even reportedly interrupting a serious meeting about covid to rant about Tucker Carlson s criticisms   suggesting that he recognizes the significance of how others  words  no matter how small they are  factor into his image   s would have a better time ignoring all of this  or at least not getting offended  and not caring if society likes them  While Trump has used the dislike of him to his advantage  going so far as to integrate this societal ostracization into his brand  it seems like deep down  he doesn t want all this conflict  He wants to be liked  at least by a certain group of people   He poses perfectly as a brash  anti elitist   with that unorthrodox combover   but before that  he was a media darling  taking every chance to show his face in mainstream media  such as in SNL and Comedy Central s roast of him  Trump has always wanted to be accepted within elitist society and only poses as an anti elitist because he has been rejected by them  I see this as a motive of a    with his   wing prompting him to build an identity around anti elitism and also develop a unique appearance and brand  The video linked above mentions a point Joe Rogan made about how Trump micromanages his own physical appearance just like he strategically chooses his words   more into that in the next paragraph   Theodore Roosevelt is as  w  as one can get  Someone literally shot his chest yet he still finished his speech  That s not to say   s can t be insecure  cowardly  or in need of external validation  but regardless of how insecure they may be   s are less likely to craft so much of their identity around their own appearance and reputation   s are known for exhibiting their strength with action and force rather than with words   while Trump certainly tries to appear as if he is a man of action  he does have a habit of saying things and then not doing them  For example  he initially pushed in December for       checks  something he could ve easily made happen with his bully pulpit over Republicans  but later balked  Also  before the capital riots  Trump told his supporters he would march with them to the capitol   and then didn t  In contrast  James K  Polk  an  w   fulfilled nearly every campaign promise he made  such as expanding western territory and serving only one term ,estp
nah  i think he acts like an ESTP but he seems more like an ENTJ to me,estp

I truly do not believe he is an ESTP  he s just acting like one  Unlike the majority  my conclusion is ENTJ    His Te dominant nature makes him want to keep progressing  His Ni is supporting his Te calls to predict what will happen if he does  insert action  although this is quite underdeveloped for a stereotypical ENTJ   His Se is being empowered by him pretending to be an ESTP  to come off as more folksy and a  man of the people   By using his Te and acting like an ESTP it may look like his Te is actually Se   His Fi makes him have questionable morals behind his choices  like storming the capitol ,estp
People are like  He can t be a    cuz   s care about their image and Trump doesn t care about his image cuz he says dumb things  as if  Donald Trump  isn t a narcissistic compulsive liar who puts his name over every building  show  and product he can get his hands on while living in an apartment covered in gold located in a golden building with his name in big bold  and gold  letters   I m not saying all the  w  voters are like this  They have many legitimate reasons for voting  w   but plenty of people have said this in the past ,estp

If PDB ever adds the top ten personality disorders to their site then the overwhelming winner on the Donald Trump page will be Narcissistic PD  This is characterised by      An exaggerated sense of self importance     A sense of entitlement     Requiring constant admiration     Exaggerating one s achievements and talents     Monopolising conversations     Belittling others     Taking advantage of others to get what one wants     Believing others envy them     Comes across as arrogant  boastful  conceited ,estp
An ESTP refusing to come to terms with current realities  Remaining completely unadaptable and unable to make any actual analysis of the present other than values and concepts of corruptions  Disinterested in reading into the situation and the people as they currently are presented whether by logic or person interest  so to anyone s benefit  because it just doesn t fit his personal vision  while also clinging to his same old gold mansions and his important name to gain some sense of security and honour    Right   Not to mention how he made up these far fetched Ni fabricated stories of vote fraud  Already way before the voting went down  and the corona virus  at no point coming to terms with them as they re happening around him and influencing his country    despite even getting COVID himself and should also have the polls analyzed  simply dismissing and refusing to take in the experiences established while just going on and on fighting because it doesn t play out the way he wants it to  Can you say Si blind  He doesn t care about  why  people are backing him up either  as you see by his reactions  he just needs someone to treat him and be by his side while he s fighting  and he uses his power to appeal even when his power is being stripped from him  at which point that s the least obvious thing you should be flexing publicly   Do you realize how bullsh  this whole thing would be even to the most unhealthy  undeveloped ESTP  His inability to just take situations for what they are  use perception and adapt to them is real loser  especially as he s so clearly a comfort kind of guy  He never truly pushes the envelope aside from Twitter trolling and playing with some businesses across the US  which is at no personal risk nor a great risk for anybody involved except for some minorities  He keeps on doing the same old  relying on what material gains and groups can keep him successful at no risk to him even when the rest of the world thinks he s a c  t  no balls  which doesn t bother him either  If you re supporting Trump  good for you  I am not here to argue your personal politics and step on your precious toes  But to those of you who vote Trump ESTP besides all of this conflicting with that and showcasing unhealthy ENTJ functions by clear default    I am here to tell you that you should reconsider  and I hope I stepped on your precious toes    Note that no negativity is to be surrounded the ENTJ type as a whole here nor enforce a negative stereotype  nor mean ESTP don t hold their whole own negatives  Clearly  both have been presented and been misrepresented in here  To a degree I can even see why  Functionally and by descriptions  what s mentioned is indicating of an  unhealthy  ENTJ person  that s it  Nothing further ,estp

Hmmm  I ve noticed that a moderate number of people have voted LIE  Wouldn t SEE or SLE would fit Trump better than LIE  due to the first two having   Dimensional Se  in Dimensionality of Functions   I happen to agree with the SEE consensus  noting how the Gamma Quadra s Se tends to be insubordinate as supposed to the Beta Se desire to subordinate others while respecting hierarchy and rules  Ti   No one can tie Trump down  He s the ultimate free spirited  gargantuan rule breaker  Program Se  PoLR Ti   He s the Sonic the Hedgehog you can t tie down  Trump sports Se in the Program Function slot quite unhealthily  aggressively and instinctively asserting dominance over everyone he can  The LIE  sporting only   Dimensional Se and rarely being an Enneatype    tends to rely on persuasive negotiations due to lacking the capacity to exert great volitional pressure on others  I wonder how many people  thinking Trump to be an ENTJ  in MBTI  assumed that Socionics  LIE were the only possible corresponding type  I d recommend checking out this chart    Certainly  one can easily be Se dominant in Socionics while still being an MBTI ENTJ  but I d say Trump happens to be an ESTP in MBTI  seeking to improvise control in all situations rather than planning his moves  Ultimately  one should note that if you take a crowd of a given MBTI type  you re likely to find varying sociotypes  Likewise  people of the same sociotype can have differing MBTI types  even if that looks silly  given the similarly named terms within these two theories   Socionics   MBTI  That s my two cents    ,estp
Watch his secret PDB account get permanently suspended  But on a side note  I don t think he s an intuitive  A lot of what he does is just instant gratification  like going on Twitter to diss someone after they criticize him   He clearly lacks the ability to understand that actions have long term consequences and takes things way to personally for a person of his standing  Anyways  OBAMNA,estp

So many ppl on here must hate ESTPs   the way they talk about how  he is one  it s obvious they hate them   or at least think so very little of them  It s weird how much they don t seem to realize that they re twisting what the functions do  as they are  just to suit their narrative  Im not saying every ENTJ  w  is bad  I like a few of them  but at least I can see the correlation between healthy  or at least not insane ones  and this guy being probably being one    he has Se  but I don t think he leads with it  I m not getting into it bc someone below me already did very well  But dude lacks Ti     doesn t think objectively  more like  he does think objectively and states what will make HIS FOLLOWERS excited  which is toxic Te Fi  not Ti aux You guys must know he s a narcissist    but besides that he s really into  power for the sake of power  like an ENTJ is naturally  and more so than an ESTP  w  would be   as that would make him more prone to  action for the sake of power  which he isn t  Yea no doubt he s an  w   with his obsession with appearing  me strong  joe weak  campaign bs    but you guys really think an ESTP would be caught dead saying that retarded rhetoric   wow  ESTPs are way more chill than that  and far less   Te about it  Maybe learn to tell the difference between Ti and Te better cause honestly they are very different  it s not hard to notice    He doesn t care about making sense to ppl who can think for themselves  they aren t that easy to control  And he s all about controlling the  dumb  masses   You ESTP typers might actually be more like him than you care to admit   ,estp
 Trump doesn t think objectively so he must be a Ti user    You guys realize that a Te user with poor Fi just ignores information they don t like or ignores information that doesn t fit within a given system  right    Trump is good at speaking at rallies  must be Fe    Trump does not empathize with his base  They view him as the only one fighting against corruption and  in dark parts of the internet  he s viewed as the second coming of Christ  He does not relate to them and he is not empathetic  His base believes that he is well intentioned  Fi  and THAT is the reason why they support him   Fe seeks out Fi     Trump is blunt and says what me means  Se user    Actually  that s somewhat true  He definitely doesn t refer to past experiences or derive meaning through physical objects like an Si user  Trump s hotels are grossly infested with gold and the  image  of luxury  The Se environments are heavily decorated as well how Trump loves to see his name on things he owns   But he s not an Se dom  Se doms seek NEW experiences  Their thirst for NEW experiences is what keeps them moving and traveling  Instead  Trump has lived in New York his entire life and decorates his environment with the image of luxury to make his Se comfortable  It s about comfort here  not new experience  I wish more ESTPs were on this web site to tell you guys themselves  They would get bored and possibly go mad if their environment looked the same all of the time   The majority has this one wrong  He s ENTJ ,estp
Who in hell said he was an INFJ   Like what     There is no way in hell that he is an INFJ  He is sensing and extroverted  From there  I couldn t tell you  although he s most likely thinking  so whether he s an ESTJ or ESTP  I don t know but INFJ    like whattttt   And   people voted that too  ,estp

 During the floor debate Wednesday over the second and possibly final impeachment of President Donald Trump  there were references to him being the worst president in American history  At a minimum  Trump seems secure in his bid to be the worst character ever to inhabit the presidency  He claims this in part by seeming not to have character at all in the classic sense   an internal compass that operates independently of his garish public performance  Even Richard Nixon had brooding  tormented dimensions to his personality  which suggested a conscience  which in turn led him to try to hide cynical and illegal behaviour under a mask of righteous piety  By contrast  news and book revelations about outrageous behaviour by Trump in private are not remotely in tension with how Trump presents himself in public  He acts as if self absorption  self delusion  bullying  bluster and disdain for rules or precedents or standards of propriety are all good things      Politico supporting the idea of Fi POLR blind spot,estp

Donald Trump is one of the most difficult public characters to type  However  ESTP doesn t convince me  who types him ESTP probably uses the Se of Socionics Why is he not ESTP  I don t notice in him Ti  and I think that he can t be Fi trickster  His ideas don t come from a subjective logic  but from Fi subjective values  But  an unhealthy and not well developed Fi  not the Fi of  for example an INFP or an ISFP  So  he is probably an unhealthy ENTJ or ESTJ  You ll probably say that he is a mess in managing the White House  so he can t be Te  But consider that    He has got a very clear idea of how things should be done and has got a high strategic and strumental view of the world  He knows what actually works and is efficient to achieve his goals and gain consensus  He is highly result oriented  but his way of organizing and manipulating the external world comes off as  altered  and impulsive by his lack of psychological stability  unhealthy  w  also  and   His Fi inferior mystification of Te facts  that gives him also an unhealthy absolutism   He sees others plotting against him and his principles everywhere Remember that being obsessed by their own principles is definitely NOT an unhealthy ESTPs  thing  it s very very rare   they are NOT principle based ,estp
Doesn t he seem more like an Fi Te user  Typically Ti Fe would be focused on some level of group comfort and would be less impulsive ,estp
I see Fi over Fe  namely in that Ti Fe is more desirous of logical soundness and recognition than Te Fi  which is results and status  Regardless  I would love to hear a case for Fe ,estp
I love him for making politics this entertaining  I can t thank him enough for that  Anyway I think his Se is supported by stimulating drugs nowadays  Anyone can be an ESTP if they take what he takes ,estp
i have no idea about this  ESTP voters  where do you see tertiary fe in him ,estp
I could see him being an ESTP here  Also  I could see Ti cause and effect style thinking being used in the beginning  You say ice cream is popular  You say the biggest problem with it is that it drips  Hmm  let me guess  you re making drip proof ice cream  It seems like he thought that Ali was whack and had a bad idea  but he still refused to outright condemn it  could be some well placed Fe  https   youtu be iqjAmIl  sY t     ,estp
he s just an     s are idea orientated  abstract  planners  very intellectually orientated  very ne esque  Meanwhile the   is about physical excitement  impulses  action  the present  possession   But  why do you guys think he s a sx    I kinda see so       he s not that aggressive ,estp
It s not necessary to be relying too much on Luca for arguments of his   ness  In the movie setting  sea monsters are looked down upon  Alberto is a sea monster  and he can t change this about himself   he has no control over how others will perceive him  and the resentment is so huge it pushes him to become antisocial  This is the reason he didn t want to merge with humans in the first place  He flatly rejects the idea of being part of society and goes out of his way to oversimplify concepts he doesn t understand completely because he    is jealous and stubborn in a way truly  and wants to be the center of Luca s life     does not want to interact with people who will think of him as inferior and thinks his life would be not shapeable to his interest and miserable just because of that  Contrary to if he ran away with Luca ,estp
Not really interested in fighting with people about this  but I m gonna say  in my opinion  that what most people seem to be using as   core arguments actually fits unhealthy    which I think is interesting and perhaps proof of how much   is remembered for only its helpful side and the Fe stereotypes people associate with it   Alberto isn t trying to control his environment to shield himself from vulnerability when he starts behaving more harshly to Luca  Oh for sure he has some   behaviours since his tritype is clearly     in some order  But the subject of their disagreement has little to do with    and everything to do with unhealthy   coping mechanisms   s want to feel needed  They want to be important to you  they feel safe in a relationship because they have something to offer  because you rely   need them   they re REJECT types  as much as   and   are  it s important not to forget that    And what goes on with Alberto around the middle of the movie is exactly that   he found himself a cute friend  a cute SIX friend who relies on him a lot  He shows Luca the ropes  tells him how to have fun  they start having these big dreams of exploring the world together    Until suddenly  Luca seems to find his footing and doesn t NEED him anymore   Luca is comfortable  he gets along great with Giula  he starts having all these plans of going to school and studying    And Alberto is standing there  his heart in his throat and can only scream  but what about ME   don t you NEED ME anymore      And THEN he tries not so much to control his environment but mostly his relationship with Luca  Going as far as to play on Luca s insecurities   you know they think we re monsters right     or try to reveal Luca s species against his will  Because as long as Luca NEEDS him  Or worse  as long as Luca can only rely on HIM    then he won t be rejected  Luca will stay with him    Unlike his dad    And the end of the movie is  in part  Alberto letting go of these   fears   almost manipulative tendencies  brought up by desperation  and deciding that he ll support Luca in everything he wants    even at his own cost  and even if he can t be CERTAIN that he won t be rejected because Luca has more than just him in his life    TLDR   Alberto isn t trying to control Luca because he s trying to shield himself from vulnerability  which would have been better accomplished by downright pretending that he doesn t care  a behaviour he also exhibits but only as an afterthought    Alberto is trying to bring back Luca closer to him  to wrestle his importance  place himself above Giula   Luca s dreams by highlighting the risks  and reassert that Luca NEEDS him  in an attempt to avoid rejection ,estp
He looked at stars in the night sky and decided they were anchovies    i thought that was a very Se dom   inf Ni sentiment  with all the conviction of aux Ti and the confidence of tert Fe   How are ESTPs always so smooth  of course Luca believed him  Really cute actually  some of the stories ESTPs have regalled me with     you all should try to be more careful tho i don t like seeing you get hurt,estp
The most healthy Se dom I have ever seen,estp
he s a  w  sx sp  sx  sp   there are already lots of arguments to why he s an   so I m gonna explain his   wing  saying  his life style is anti self preservation  is not an argument  you have to look into the   subtypes  for   and even   the social subtype is the countertype  they usually don t look like  s  s  Alberto is much more of a self preservation   or even    the control he exerts over the environment is purely sexual  one to one  followed by the self preservation instinct of taking or himself and his needs  he doesn t show social instinct at any time he even goes  against  it    SX SP want to choose their friends wisely  A  with me or against me  attitude reminiscent of   and  s  The least inhibited of all stackings  Cares less of what others think of them  The most likely to get into physical altercations  and may even enjoy fighting  Healthy SX SP s will display a playful selfishness    SX SP have a inner confidence which is not usually found in other stackings  However they may lack social confidence or just may not pay any attention to social rituals at all  Put a SX SP in a busy bar and they will be confident in themselves  But make them sit at their parent in laws for a formal family dinner and you won t see that same confidence  It s inner confidence rather than social confidence of the SX SO  May be very popular without knowing or putting emphasis on it  unlike SO types    SX SP does create a kind of isolationary tendency though even in extroverted types  an in their own world vibe  kinda oblivious sometimes  But ironically they can also be extremely insistent and aggressive on issues they feel strongly about  which they go on about in the SO realms in ways that will cause stronger SO s to cringe  it s so rough and undiplomatic  They can fall in love with their soapboxes  They can tune out of conversations  reacting suddenly when someone says something interesting  then snapping back to their inner focus whenever it gets boring  Also  making the odd crude joke  in bad taste  Or a faux pas  where they don t know it s the wrong thing to say until afterwards  or don t care     you can also read about the sx so description to compare   now the Self Preservation    his wing     Stylistically  Self Preservation Sevens are cheerful and amiable  with traits that resemble a hedonistic   playboy  or  playgirl  type  They tend to be warm  friendly  and talkative   They love to talk   They can express a kind of greed and impatience that reflects their desire to consume as many pleasurable experiences as possible  they want to eat everything  They expend a lot of energy on controlling everything  handling things without being noticed  And most of the time  they get away with getting what they want   The dominant traits of the Self Preservation Seven subtype stand out as a love of pleasure and a self interested focus on getting what they need to feel secure  In seeking security  however  they can often confuse desires with needs  These are people who usually feel a need to have a lot of resources  including money and other supplies that support survival  and they may panic if they feel a sense of scarcity   According to Naranjo  the three main fixations of the Self Preservation Sevens are strategy  rebellion  and isolation  though it may be hard to see these characters as isolated because they tend to be very popular  But their strategic and mental nature  together with the prominence of their selfinterest  can isolate them from others at a deeper level   Self Preservation Sevens cultivate a sense of being kind and generous they like to feel that everyone depends on them  They may feel omnipotent and they may sometimes use people  They may also feel that normal rules don t apply to them that for them  there is no law  and they can do what they please  This kind of assertion of their freedom and their ability to do whatever they need to do to support their self interest helps them feel safer in the world  ,estp
Not the ENTP votes LMAOOO,estp
LET S GOOOOO ANDIAMO  CIAO ALBERTO  IS RELEASING NOVEMBER    ON DISNEY    y all what is up with the enneagram and attitudinal psyche votes   alberto exhibits many more   traits than    imo   the whole movie is about him trying to unlearn the fact that he doesn t have to prove himself to be admired  the tower scene is when he acknowledges his first vulnerability  being perceived as incapable and unequipped to handle the world around him  he tackles that with his w    and as for flev  alberto attempts to construct a cognitive guide of the world around him by connecting with the physical world around him  i e   idk i touched it once  it felt like a fish so therefore everything else in the sky is fish    he s pretty unstable unexpressive in the emotional region  though that could be because of his dad   but he s also pretty unbudging when it comes to his goals  he s constantly reminding luca throughout the film that adventure is out there and they have to leave portorosso eventually ,estp
Could you better develop Alberto s Attitudinal Psyche  I don t think he would have emotion   but Physics   or   seems right to me,estp
why on earth is he voted as an ESE and  E  is it because he s nice to luca  like i genuinely don t understand ,estp
ISTP   Why would Max be Fe Inferior      I also don t remember her being as much of a Ti Dominant too  I never saw her using knowledge to understand the world around her  it seemed more Aux to me   ExTP    Plus  wouldn t Self pres   make more sense over Social         EDIT   Nvm  I think the ISTP votes are from the book  That possibility should have crossed my mind       However  in the series  ESTP fits best  she uses Se to interact w  the world around her ,estp
Someone who has read the book about her can explain the Se dom  I just think that she shows more Ti in there,estp
I hated what they did to her in season    The interesting and tortured version of Max was entirely replaced with an unlikeable mall brat who talked about boys and had no other definable traits  Honestly  sad to watch ,estp
I don t see much   traits in her at all why    ,estp
wtf is the filter on her picture  ,estp
Why Choleric dom instead of Chol Sang  I feel like she also embodies some Sanguine traits but lmk what you think    ,estp
Why are there no arguments for the socionics  I don t remember her well enough to make one but I see the merit in both SEE and ESI   So  help ,estp
Why so  over sp   Also  no way she s a Ti dom  There s practically no scene where she may appear like that,estp
i haven t watched st in AGES so why the   fix  ,estp
Ooooff it s a close one  To be honest though I feel like she just sees things as the way they are showing extremey high Se    When Eleven tried telling here about the missing life guard vision she assumed that it was her brother having sex   She assumed the ice bath was for her brother s muscles and didn t think about other possibilities   She thought that Lucas s story about the demagorgan was stupid even though it was the truth   She didn t believe in Lucas s fire cracker plan because she thought it was stupid  thinking using eleven would be a better plan not taking into account that she could be tired She also seems to be more in touch with her Fe too as she seems to know social norms and tries to explain them to Eleven  In her first apperance she definetly comes across as an ISTP  but in the third season I see ESTP ,estp
wtf how is she ISTP  shes like her brother but a healthy way,estp
Se is not a function about being outgoing  it is about interacting with the physical environment and indulging in it  seeing things on a surface level instead of looking too deeply into things  it can be narrow minded  seeing things only from one objective perspective of what actually happened   If the INFJ wants to put deep meaning into everything and look into things obsessively then the ESTP will look at things as is and notice everything in their environment instead of one thing as ESTP likes living in the actual world instead of their own tangible ideas,estp
Ha  All the comments are ESTP votes  And yet ISTP is still winning  That s because she is Xtriverted  Don t read it out loud  The similarity to extraversion is not intended ,estp
I know that there are two schools of thought when trying to decide whether or not she is introverted or extroverted  Most people who type her as an introvert see her this way due to her first appearance in season two  where she is seemingly reserved  Those who type her as an extrovert see her as one because of the most recent season where she is very assertive  outgoing  and talkative  The way I see it  I think she went through some character development which led to her becoming an extrovert  In season two she was mistreated by her brother and had no friends  She was angry which led her to be more reserved  In season three she has friends and her brother starts to leave her alone this could be the reason her character changes to an extrovert ,estp
She s definitely an xSTP  I d say her Se outweighs her Ti  though  People have pointed out how she s more outgoing than Hopper  who s an ISTP  I also think that her Fe is higher up than her Ni and people have also pointed out that her Ni seems more inferior in season    I m fine with other people explaining why she her Ti is higher up than her Se  but I ll just say she s an ESTP for now ,estp
Her Fe seems too apparent for her to be an ISTP ,estp
Suggested enneagram type for Max ,estp
Guys    Max is not an ESTP just because she s  more social  or  more talkative  this season  Does Max show inferior Ni this season  THAT is the question you should be asking if you want to suggest that she is an ESTP ,estp
She seems like an extrovert to me  Way more socially inclined than Hopper  an ISTP  ,estp
i feel like ESTP voters were letter typing or stereotyping,estp
ESTP  i don t see fe in her at all  if ever she must be an ESFP  her motive and literally everything in the movie seems very fi to me,estp
If you remember why what happened in the movie  She followed her internal codes and her morals that is why she refused to marry and that is why she confronted her mother is clearly ESFP,estp
ESFP  Her Fi is obvious  it s all about her feelings  wants and how she feels about the marriage  and using Te goals to achieve what she wanted irregardless of it s effect on others  I e no Fe   I see her Fi Te  My ESTP brother would have never resisted  he s very harmonious and just goes with social norms   Her quarrel with her mother is that her stating her mother never bother asking what she wants  Fi   ENTP have Fi trickster they don t know their wants  Merida is all about fighting for her wants  Fi ,estp
Oh man  what is this consensus   I m not seeing Ti in this girl  Ti Fe seeks knowledge and accuracy Ti   and uses charm and persuasion to get what they want Fe   Fi Te seeks to express oneself and be who they are freely OUTSIDE of social values Fi   and uses quick objective methods to get what they want Te      Te tert   As a tertiary function  Te manifests as the ability to source whichever resources are necessary to make the user s desire a reality  The tertiary Te monologue   I will employ the most straightforward method that exists in order to make my goal  dream or impulse come true      Fe tert   As a tertiary function  Fe manifests as the ability to pick up on the motivations and emotions of those around the user  The immature Fe user may then take advantage of those feelings by manipulating them in a way that supports his or her own ends  The mature tertiary Fe user will search for a means of incorporating the needs of others into their personal plans and actions    The whole story is about being her upset that her mother didn t support who she really is  and who she wanted to be Fi   She had to seek methodical solutions outside of her own from the witch Te  to get to a place where she can stay who she is freely   Fi isn t just  oh ima a good moral person   it is a seeker of internal harmony  and individuality set apart from the general community expectations  There are evil Fi users that exist that have no morals  they just do what they feel like    She has no Ti Fe at all  And people need to realize that Fi is so much more than just  morals   and Ti is not just  thinking in a detached manner   Cuz everyone can have their own morals  and have their own logical opinions  So functions are typed by the individuals preferences and how they process the functions   She isn t curious on finding logical reasons to do anything or is curious of how a process works Ti   the only reasons she needs is when somebody interrupts her values and who she wants to be Fi   Ti is about frameworks  analytics and methodical tactics  Not intelligence  cleverness and personal opinion of thought   For example I m a Ti dom and I m terrible at math  I have Fi user friends who are spectacular at math  Reason being I see no logical reasoning to study advanced math cuz it s never once helped me advance in life  Fi users love math out of passion  not to be more equipped for knowledge    She s ESFP,estp
Is it already a tendency to see each ESTP as a mistyped ESFP ,estp
This whole Ti vs Fi debate would be settled if you guys just came to the realization that she s ENTP  Here s why  The basis for her actions and rebellion are sparked by her inferior Si  neither Ti or Fi  She hates clan tradition  That s why she doesn t want to be a princess  Being a princess has too many old fashioned rules that just don t make sense to Merida and hinder her from new experiences  Merida quotes   My mother is in charge of every single day of my life  My whole life is planned out  Until the day I become  well  my mother   Inf Si  she can t make her own choices  and despises the idea of not being free  and doesn t enjoy routine  Si is very clearly her achilles heel  Ti because Ti Fe  Going back to inf Si  she s angered as to why people expect certain things from her  this is clearly shown in the beginning of the movie when she says she  can t get away with anything    she has to be the example   Ti is pretty obvious  Fi doesn t have proper premise  She makes decisions based on whether or not something aligns with her logic if something doesm t make sense  She has her own way of doing things  Some people are going  Merida rebels because she wants to be true to herself   Please  she doesn t even know who she really is  she just doesn t want to be controlled  inf Si      She isn t focused on being authentic  nor does she have any ideals or values true to her  She s a very logic driven character  Her feelings are plainly seen because    she has tert FE and    She s an  w   When something obstructs them  they will act based on their personal justice  You can t label  w s as Fi because of that  can you  Her Ne is unconscious  but it s still very clear because she seeks new experiences all the time and is easily bored with routine  She makes comnections very easily through her intuitive observations  Ne can be just as spontaneous as Se   Some could argue that her turning her mom into a bear is actually inf Ni  but leading up to that point  it was all inf Si working in the shadows  She turned her mom into a bear because she was flustered and full of emotions  Immature  tert Fe emotions  mind you  There you have it  She s neither ESTP or ESFP  but ENTP ,estp
For the ESFP votes   IF she has such a good grasp on her Fi  why would she need to learn it  Isn t the point of learning something is because you want to master it or you are lacking that trait ,estp
Definitely an ESTP  Fi is a function that makes decision according to their own values and morals  Ti on the other hand is more logical and the decision is made whether or not a thing makes sense according to their own logic  I don t think Merida based her decision according to values  she judges and makes a decision whether or not it makes sense,estp
where s the ti extra words,estp
So I know no one is voting this but he is      INFP because   Fi  he acts on his own desires  needs and wants  has a strong sense of self   Ne  he s an out of the box thinker which is why he does so many different chaotic things  to fuel his ideas  and he has a dream of getting money which is Ne fantasy   Si  he s good with connecting to the past which is why it s hard for him to change his ways for a while   Te  he lacks objective logic   Also him being INFP explains why he clicks so well with rapunzel ENFP  He s also definitely more introverted since he wants to live alone on and island with money   He s actually in a Te grip in the beginning which is why he s so impulsive to take actions for his goal and Ne dream of getting money and being rich  When he finds love  Fi  with rapunzel it helps him go back to normal and he s a healthy introverted moral INFP again   I m jk lol how easy it is to make bad arguments sound reasonable,estp
he s like the perfect example of a guy that seems like an ENTP stereotype but is most definitely a se dom,estp
No wonder why he is so relatable lmao,estp
I think  just like Prince Naveen  he was on a Se journey  except of course the Ti  His Se Ti journey is him starting out with him being dumb and reckless  trying to do everything on his own     like how he s literally a thief and keeps throwing himself into situations out of impulse    Dude literally decided to run away to a falling tree branch to escape a freaking horse bruh like that s gonna help  Eventually Rapunzel  Ne Fi  showed him that there s more to life than just one particular dream  I mean she didn t show it literally  she just kinda showed up  in which that s when Flynn found his new dream     with her  Cute story anyway  but his Se Ti is so obvious and hot,estp
the  mega hot deuteragonist  in the description is sending me lmao,estp
I believe in Chad characters supremacy  ,estp
Gonna get tangled in somethin else tonight Rider   No homo ,estp
he is not ENTP lol  he is way too hot,estp
 I have dreams like you  no  really Just much less touchy feely They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny On an island that I own Tanned and rested and alone Surrounded by enormous piles of money    yeah he s an ESTP,estp
Why Se dom though  He seems to be more of an ENTP  Now that I think of it Nick Wilde is a very similar character ,estp
come on  guys  his name is literally  solo and solo  alone  alone  lonely  lonely  introvert so there is no way this guy is an ESTP  he has to be an ISTP,estp
Solo was an obvious  w   Rather than thinking about the chances of success  he risked everything  hoping he would succeed ,estp
when we first see han  he s very skeptical of  hokey religions and ancient weapons  because he s in a Ti Ni loop and is Ne blind  he believes only in what he knows  which is the underworld of gangsters and smugglers   throughout a new hope  han engages his Se through the invasion of the death star with chewie  ben and luke  this also engages his Fe as well  but since it s his inferior function  he doesn t come around immediately   han later working with the rebellion is a much better example of utilizing his Fe  he now has much more to care about than just chewie  the falcon  and himself  and in turn  becomes a better man ,estp
  Scoundrel  Scoundrel    I like the sound of that    MBTI     I can see where the ISTP votes are coming from  he did seem a more grumpy and resigned outlaw as opposed to Lando Calrissian s more stylistic and smooth ESTP nature  but I think Han s extraverted functions are more prominent than his introverted ones  such as the hilarious scene when he was yelling and running after the Stormtrooper in the Death Star hallway only to find a room full of troopers   such seems to be a result of more daredevil like Se Dom attitude of embracing the adrenaline  whereas a Ti Dom might be a bit more calculated      But yeah  he does have a charismatic attitude that s all too present for Fe to be an inferior function  especially everything with his flirtatious words with Princess Leia and channeling it through Se sensuality  but this tertiary Fe comes up in more mature ways too later on in Return of the Jedi when he embraces his role as a general to lead the rebel forces through the forest moon of Endor      I think his whole talk about thinking the Force and the Jedi are of a hookey religion and Luke just needed a blaster by his side to make his way through the galaxy indicate Han s Ti  having logically evaluated survival strategies as they pertain to what his dominant Se experiences form the immediate environment and thus his calculated ability to remain calm in a crisis  especially the goofy scene where he puts his legs up on control board in the control room in the Death Star while Luke is freaking out   Nowallyouwanttodoisstay     ENNEAGRAM     I think Han s scruffy looking nerfherder presence comes from how much of an escapist maverick he is through Enneagram  w   constantly propelled by a repressed anxiety to keep moving towards bounties to pursue and adventure  but also coming up badly in his materialism as was shown in A New Hope before he came back to help in the air raid upon the Death Star      I d have to do more reading for realistically understanding how how   s integrate into healthy   likeness of curiosity and slowly down to knowledgeably appreciate what s already there in life  I think this does when Han has more calculated strategies as a military leader on the forest moon of Endor versus his more daredevil strategies in the Empire Strikes Back that gets the gang caught by Boba Fett      Otherwise  being more critical and perfectionism comes up per unhealthy   like behaviors when Leia s more arms length Te Si professionalism pushes back against his sexual tension  thus stirring up frustration and causing Han to be critical and particular with Leia  such as the whole deal in the Hoth base hallway about Han making a fuss about what the Rebellion needs versus what Leia needs   PERSONAL THOUGHTS     It s         hilarious how much Han s own cynicism about the Jedi and the Force seems almost analogous with how much Harrison Ford hates being associated with Star Wars  especially when he butted heads about the scripts and dialogue with George Lucas  his whole deal about  You can write this       but you can t say it  to paraphrase  almost as if he might as well make the most of concentrating his personal cynicism through the Han character      Unfortunately  I wasn t too enamored with the Han Solo origin story movie as it seems victim to the more  fanservicey  and movie theater fetish artificiality that contaminated the sequel trilogy  all of the events that Han Solo speaks of happening in a single frame of time  going a bit overkill with the quips  and inappropriately portraying him as more of a  good guy  versus a more immersive experience of moral ambiguity   oh  and Disney may not be so much responsible for this   but this also took away from the iconic who shot first scene in a New Hope when it was reshot that Greedo shot first to emphasize Han s  goodness  when it would ve been more compelling if her shot first to show his moral ambiguity      It s unfortunate that Disney came up with a contrived excuse for Han to go back to smuggling work in the Force Awakens per nostalgia  but if there was anything to be scavenged  I think it was a very appropriate narrative moment to have Kylo Ren kill Han to show his decline into the Dark Side  although I wish we would ve gotten more father son interactions between two and NO  the silly stupidness that took place in Rise of Skywalker with  ghost  Han does not count   Thank you ,estp
I think he is either an ISTP or ESTP myself   Some introvert traits I found were that he was very mistrusting and not only that  han himself was a loner  But let s get this straight  that s just a stereotype for introverts Not only that  Han solo didn t need break time from social circles as most introverts would have  I feel that his activities and decisions are based off his own thinking  giving him the T type  For the extraversion  I really conclude that he is an ambivert myself ,estp
Definitely see him as a classic ISTP character  Action oriented but not outright reckless like many ESTPs  Keeps to himself unless approached,estp
Chad absolutely      and about the tritype  im agree he is     but for the heart im not sure he is   or    But since he help someone just for the money  I prefer   ,estp
How is Han a   fix  He doesn t seem to care much for success,estp
Where is the teritary Fe in this guy  He seems to have very little interest in how he is viewed by others  expressing himself  being reactive  etc  Seems like a Ti dom character set on his view of the world and what makes sense  Overly serious as well  compare him to actual ESTP Lando  The whole Leia romance thing is like a fun side quest to him  Though in the Solo movie  he seems more like ESTP ,estp
He s very LSE imo  he does everything in pragmatic way and he s the typical  know it all  that Te socionics users are known  clearly valuing Si   Se always prefers to live a simple life  never has any particular goal or ideology  definitely more Delta ST than Beta ST  also he s not Fe polr  he knows how to bring enough emotional context to persuade others and he does it often  he manages to put himself in a leadership position any time almost naturally  i d say Ni polr instead  he can be very impatient sometimes when something takes a long time due to lack of efficiency  I don t think he has Fi creative  he seeks a lot of autonomy and independence for that  but he still values Fi  we can see that from the relationship he has chewbacca or even Leia in the most recent movies  so he s definitely not Fi polr ,estp
her fe shined in that conversation with dippy  truly honoured to share a type with her,estp
Just curious  but why Sp so  w     I d like to be convinced and enlightened  not that I disagree ,estp
inferior Fe does not make so much sense    she has too much Fe to be inferior  not because she is a healthy user but well  for the people who ask  is that combination of enneagram and mbti possible   well yeah  all the combinations are possible  just that some are more likely than others    wendy I LOVE YOU  ,estp
Wish I could kin her but she has more Se Fe than most ISTPs have,estp
she has way too much fe for it to be inferior,estp
omg yay  we are redhead twins  ,estp
Tert Fe makes more sense to me  Compare her to dipper who has inf Fe and he can be pretty insensitive and selfish when he doesn t mean to be  I don t recall seeing her that wends   She has the ISTP vibe but I think that s her phlegmatic temperament and   enneagram,estp
I could see either xSTP tbh,estp
She is such a  w   but is ESTP  W  even possible ,estp
Hey guys I ve been thinking abt it and why FLEV   FELV  I don t think she has insecure emotion at all  Edit  Why SLI   She doesn t show the emotional coldness nor emotional ambiguity of Fe polr   and delta quadra  Alpha quadra is so obvious  she s incredibly easy going and forgiving  SEI makes far more sense   and she d be more likely to be ESE than SLI ,estp
Why E   A in Big        characters ,estp
Y ll who can t differentiate between ENTJ and ESTP are forcing me to watch me the show   But probably the character has no personality ,estp
Changed to ESTP again lmao this character is so difficult to type TOT,estp
The heck  Could ve sworn I wrote a longer thread on this page last night  Either I imagined it or PBD glitched and erased it    Lmao the wiki bio tho  This made my day         Legit sums up the only reason I tried tolerating this show  Really tho  hot dayummm       Maybe I ll try continuing it later but the writing of this show is ass  no offense  Does anyone have an actual argument for Bell being a Te dom tho  Let alone an actual example where he demonstrates high Ni  Literally the only argument I ve seen so far is  Oh dude  obvious Te dom  If you don t see it  rewatch the show   That isn t an argument and honestly get old  Some people actually want to have discussions on types    I normally avoid typing characters if I haven t watched a series in full  but I do  whatever the hell I want   Deal with it        SO FAR though  he seems like an ESTP to me  For one thing  someone with high Ni would be more focused on the potential implications consequences of circumstances or their actions  Same with a Te dom    they d be more focused on creating order  efficiency  and organization in their environment vs  well   chaos  Bell seems like a more present focused live in the now kind of dude  I understand ENTJs can be impulsive averse to social norms too  but it s for different reasons  typically because they hold so much confidence in making their insights future   not present  ambitions a reality   Bell s impulsive more cause he wants to defy authority and he s doing it out of sheer rebellion  unless he shows a need to create order later on in the series   DISCLAIMER    I m not trying to say ESTPs dont t think at all  but that they re simply more present focused and don t think much about future implications potential consequences  Contrast him with Clarke  an ENFJ if you really want to see the difference  As soon as they get back on earth  the urge for chaos and rebellion is pretty obvious  Does it occur to them that they might need their bracelets to communicate with their parents if they needed help were in trouble  That the food he hunted for might not be safe to eat  As an Ni dom  I d be a lot more wary of certain things like that  His impulsiveness gives me anxietuh   ,estp
why does it say ENTJ and then shows ESTJ    this man is literally ESTP ,estp
Bro I swear this guy s type changes every month   While I ve only seen a couple of episodes from the show  from what I ve heard from others he s seems to be a really inconsistently written character  and if that s the case then doesn t that make him impossible to type   Of course he s going to be ESTP in some episodes and then ENTJ in others if that s the case ,estp
Where are these ENTJ votes coming from  I haven t seen one plausible argument on him being an ENTJ  or at least plausible compared to other arguments  His Ni is no where to be seen and these ESTP arguments are the best we ve got  ESFP seems like a better choice than ENTJ  Come on  you can t just blindly type someone  Think it through ,estp
I think you guys are focusing on his dominant function a bit too much  You ll never be able to correctly type a character only based on his dominant function   They have a core four for a reason    Dominant  Auxiliary  Tertiary and Inferior    ALSO don t forget that functions adapt themselves based on the other functions of your core four  Take ESTJ and ENTJ as example   Both have Te as their dominant function but they use it in different way ish  I think you guys are focusing on his dominant function a bit too much  You ll never be able to correctly type a character only based on his dominant function   They have a core four for a reason    Dominant  Auxiliary  Tertiary and Inferior    ALSO don t forget that functions adapt themselves based on the other functions of your core four  Take ESTJ and ENTJ as example   Both have Te as their dominant function but they use it in different way ish  Jejjeje Srry pero la plataforma me lo pide    Dice que este arriba de      as  que como chingada madre voy a hacer eso tremendo me faltan como    palabras no pus k horror vamos a llorar,estp
La verdad me duele un poco que sea ESTP pero es m s por su corazon modo no tuvo corazon cuando mato a     personas ya que pije lo manipulo por la muerte de gina y le dio a entender que si su hermana  Octavia  segu a juntandose con ellos le pod a pasar algo ya que se juntaba mucho con ellos  He s an ESTP because his Ni is weak af  It s clear right from the start  A high Ni user  as soon as they land on Earth  would consider all the possible options available and will narrow them down to choose the best course of action   As soon as Bellamy landed on Earth  he advocated to take off the wristbands  which is stupid as hell  because he didn t consider any potentially dangerous possibilities like   there might be some kind of a monster s  here  maybe the food is poisonous  maybe the rain is acid  it s possible that only this area is safe to stay and the rest of the planet is filled with radiation  etc   There are too many possibilities a high Ni user would consider to move forward with a plan in such a situation  Unlike Bellamy who just moves straight into action before considering any possible future scenarios  This behaviour is repeated throughout all the seasons ,estp
I actually considered INFJ because he s so nice and thoughtful but his ne is to strong I love him and he s my biggest inspiration I just hope he takes better care of himself,estp
He jokes a lot and he s a funny man  But he can t keep a wife lol,estp
socially extraverted INTPs       ,estp
Ive got three uncles  in all cases  you could say they are  based out of space  The first uncle  my dads brother is quite a freespirit fellow  Id honestly say hes kind of an XXTP but Im not really sure because he lives far and we dont meet often  but yet he feels comfy to be with kinda and is a professional musician  cant stand expectations from others and the such  also very religious  divorced with   kid he doesnt meet anymore and believes in conspiracy theories that covid doesnt exist and the such  Probably an  w  or smth like that  He gives the same vibe that my dad gives even though my dad is like the  good kid   compared to him  Uh my first uncle from my mothers side is an IXTP that is morally okay with commiting crimes  was a  bad kid  as a teenager but he now  works  at high tech as a manager  but from what I understand he doesnt do much there  mostly filling his time with learning about stuff ot doing personal projects  which he is pretty good at   I have no idea how he got there but I assume he had to do some tricks to where he is today  The only crime he had been caught with was stealing a car once  Married an EXFJ  w  and has   daughters  all of them very cool   My second uncle from my moms side is a pretty cool ENTP that also was a  bad kid  and did lotsa drugs  but then he pretty much just went and got a phD in psychobiology but now he just works as a manager in a  company that advises pharmacutical companies   which he is probably overqualified for that  Married a cool french girl that does a lot of art   Comoared to my mom they got this laid back confidence she has on life but my mom was somehow much less affected by all the insanity of youth but yea man  Cool family I have,estp
He s nice to me  but his unhealthy Fi can be really annoying sometimes especially when he s talking to my ESTJ grandma ,estp
funcle,estp
he kinda just acts like a clown here and everyone loevs it  D,estp
he s gives of ISFP vibes he is sociable but not extraverted he tends to be chill and usually talks in feeling than in the logical sense  is not big on life planning and BIG Fi and Te guy he is friendly and likes to help and treat others like how he wants to be and always looks at the obvious problem and see what is the best possibly way to fix it and at times he will still think he need to fix something when the problem has already been solved  Ex  when he is fixing lights he will still think something is wrong or not perfect  his Se is also pretty obvious he is very much the take in what you have kinda guy he doesnt like to dwell on past or future and is trying to find things for him that are fun and will satisfy him   i dont talk to him much like i used to but i see him every now and then and ill say he s the cool chill uncle that gives you chocolate and tells you to hide it from your parents great guy,estp
He low key hates women  he goes to bed at  pm and wakes up at  am to play video games  he s a         nerd  he talks like ben shapiro tbh  and he really hates communism and doesn t stop talking abt how much he hates it  ,estp
before someone decides to remind me it s inappopriate to call an elder family member that way  imma say it  malewife ,estp
He without a doubt has good Fe and Ni but he s still too spontaneous and even physical  solves everything with fighting  to be an ENFJ imo,estp
I saw some ENFJ votes and i see where they are comming from and it makes a lot of sense  but him being an ESTP is much more likely than dom Fe for him and the reason for that is he only cares that much for his close friends  as far as i know its canon that he would often just walk up to people and punch them for no reason other than to start a fight because he is bored or burn cars just because he is hungry  if he was a fe dom and ni aux i dont think these situations would happen  especially not as often as they are claimed to and because of that i think tert Fe  Dom si and Ti aux is much more likely for him,estp
I would say ESTP  I think if Baji were ENFJ  he would try to be more peaceful in his way of resolving conflicts  it may seem like stereotypes  but each type has a different way of acting   Baji s plan to end Kisaki was great  but it had flaws and inconveniences Like taking a kazutora stab  being stopped by your friends  all of that  I think a NI would determine your goal and with a perfect plan would eliminate the things that can hinder your plan before even taking action   even so he went ahead  showing that he doesn t need a plan so much and that he can adapt in regardless of what is happening  Baji is someone who is great at taking quick action and figuring things out by being very adaptable and flexible   In my view  ENFJ makes more sense than any other type except ESTP  as it may be a lack of NI use  If we compare it to Kisaki  you will see that Kisaki always has great plans Whenever something happens  it ends up standing out in many ways  that was my vision  and I enjoyed sharing it with all of you    Another thing I would like to say is that the tertiary can develop a lot as we see his EF but it is not at the level of overshadowing the dominant and the way he resolves his conflicts is direct  fast  not much planning  just quick action   A good example is when he saves takemichi by hitting him    I think if he were an FE user he would try a chat or something  something more harmonious  He literally prevented the takemichi from being punished by the captains directly  quickly and without thinking too much,estp
Has anyone considered ENFJ instead for Baji  His Fe is extremely strong  everything he did was for the sake of others  and his Ni is apparent as well  especially in the Bloody Halloween chapter  An ENFJ could have strong Se as much as ESTP s Fe  I actually struggle to see his Ti where he chose to sacrifice himself instead of giving punishment towards Kazutora  A high Ti user won t do that  Did we all type him as ESTP because he is strong and rebellious ,estp
   Previously I stated that Baji is a very healthy ESTP with developed Fe and Ni  but now I don t think he is an ESTP anymore  His Se  Fe and Ni are evident  but I struggle to see his Ti  Basically everything he did was for the sake of others  especially where he chose to sacrifice himself just to prevent his friends  Mikey and Kazutora  fighting does not seem like something a high Ti user would do at all  His Ni usage is also apparent where he noticed Kisaki s plans and knew that he was a bad person by his instincts  Yes  Baji is wild  strong and rebellious  but remember that ENFJs have developed Se has much as ESTPs have Fe      Tritype             Baji doesn t have a need to prove himself worthy to others  nor a calculative and cunning individual  In fact I can even see Sp  w  over So  w    When he was younger he promised Kazutora that he will stay besides Kazutora till the end  no matter what happens  And he kept that promise through self sacrificing  he chose to kill himself and he asked Mikey to forgive Kazutora   When he first met Chifuyu  the reason why he tried to study wasn t because he wanted to look smart  not because he had to pretend to  but because he didn t want to upset his mother again  I think this is very   over     The reason why he doesn t strike as the charming  playful  w  is because he is rather the moralistic  w   He loves and wants to protect every individual around him  Just like Hina  Sp  w   told Takemichi that she will protect him  that s what Baji did for his friends  for Kazutora and Chifuyu  Maybe Mikey too   Baji doesn t really have the need to take control over his property  Sp   nor boss around others  Sx    ig his   fix fits most to Social    but before that  Baji doesn t have the need to make own decisions for himself  Actually he usually just listens to what either Kazutora or Chifuyu says      I think his temperament is Choleric Sanguine because he values social harmony a lot just to be a dominant Choleric  Previously I stated that he might be Choleric Melancholic because of his moral driven characteristics but that might be simply his Sp  w  fix ,estp
Without a doubt this guy is an ESTP  I m not so sure about the enneagram  but  w  makes more sense to me than  w ,estp
do y all realize that now bajitrio  bajitorafuyu  are literally sharing the same enneagram   w    how cute ,estp
Keisuke  Edward  Baji       ,estp
why choleric   why not sanguine or at least choleric sanguine ,estp

I know some people might feel that Beidou isn t an   in her hangout  but I feel that it only reinforced the fact that she is a so   and has   in her security integration point and   in her stress disintegration point  She just seems like a healthy and mature so  who s integrated to     I can understand why someone would think sp sx  w   but I maintain my so  stance  as she doesn t fit the arrows to     like a   would  She could possibly have a   in her tritype  though ,estp
why is she non inquisitive in big    shes extremely open  her type should be SCUAI      life of the party  not bothered by disorder  not afraid of doing the wrong thing  often late  level emotions  not afraid to draw attention to self  worry free  people loving  prefers unpredictable to organized  fearless  not apprehensive about new encounters  likes philosophical discussions  disorganized  not easily annoyed  not a perfectionist  enjoys danger  comfortable in unfamiliar situations  anxiety free  always joking  not very private  very curious  not embarrassed easily  adventurous  flexible  trusting  easy to get to know  easy to satisfy  likes crowds  ready to act on the spot  not a bad loser  outgoing  thrill seeker  not easily discouraged  optimistic  laid back  open to new experience  slow to judge others  thinks fun is the most important think in life  socially skilled  easily talked into doing silly things  rarely prepared  willing to take risks  adjusts easily  passionate about causes  willing to explain things twice  spontaneous  relaxed  believes in universal harmony  eager to soothe hurt feelings   SCUAI ,estp
uh    can someone explain ti aux ,estp
I m questioning SLE tbh  I don t think Fi PoLR fits her  She seems too pleasant and has too much camaraderie with others   She is a reliable and strong captain  getting along well with her entire crew  prioritizing the interests of her ship and crew first above everything else   SEE voters have a better claim to her   If we look at Wikisocion s description of Fi PoLR  it seems wrong for Beidou   The individual does not normally pay attention to the nuances of interpersonal relationships  he is either overly suspicious or overly assuming of his relations with others when they are not clearly defined  More importance is given to these relations as they pertain to objective mutual benefit  entertaining one another and accomplishing mutual goals are seen as the main focus  rather than seeing the relationships as rewarding in and of themselves     Instead of looking at relations for benefit  she is actually just really loyal and caring about her crew  She takes care of them and does things for them  She doesn t seem to hold strong principles on life or value consistency in thought  She also cares about how people perceive her relations with others   Beidou is also on good terms with Ganyu  but because of her poor standing with the Liyue Qixing  she keeps it a secret to avoid putting a negative light on her   I can t see an SLE caring about putting a negative social light on people at all   SEEs also don t value relations and ethics in the same way Fi leads do because they are flexible as with the creative function   The individual is very adept at perceiving  establishing  and maintaining personal bonds between people  However  these bonds are often perceived as being situational and flexible rather than static  The individual is inclined to focus on establishing personal bonds with other people in the context of realizing or following perceptions from his base function   She values her crew and gets along with them because it keeps things together and keeps them productive and keeps them strong  as Se lead wants  This seems more accurate for her type ,estp
Why is she voted as flexible volition  That doesn t really make much sense   V is all about adapting their goals towards the benefit of those around them  being exceedingly democratic with others and desiring compromise  I d say Beidou was more  V than  V since she likes to break rules in Liyue and doesn t really seek compromise or mutual interest outside of those in her crew  Seems less passive and more aggressive in nature  She seems confident in her goals to keep her crew s interest in mind above all else and has the typical  pack leader   V behavioral trait that goes against social norms expectations for their people unlike  V   The whole part of her character enjoying food and drink and being curious to try out new dishes also seems pretty  F over  F imo personally  since it s open to external sources and others positive others negative,estp
Can t wait for new material about her to drop in      I ve been waiting for a story quest with Beidou ever since I pulled her in early game    I think that she s pretty much an obvious Se dominant  She s indulgent  adventurous  and from what hear of her from her crew and her voice lines a very hands on person    I agree with everyone else with the whole  healthy    thing  Being an Se dominant can be confused with being a Type    She definitely has a   fix in her tritype  though ,estp
literally the second i got her all i did was just go  hot   every time i used her to attack    in actual typing news  i feel like she s a Se dom  she s very physical and indulgent with her activities  not sure about  w  vs  w   though   edit  i decided on her being a healthy  w   all she wants is autonomy,estp
Alright  About a month ago I brought up the concept of Beidou being an   rather than a   and finally have a properly constructed argument with in game lines and all that jazz  It makes sense why people would see her as a    Se doms  especially healthy  s  often get typed as  s  this also seen in characters like Eleanor Shellstrop from The Good Place   but her going out and experiencing things and adventuring definitely seems to be more coming from Se than wanting to not miss out  Not to mention she doesn t show most of the traits commonly associated with  s i e  being notably optimistic or spontaneous  Her adventure doesn t come from spontaneity  she s a leader who knows what she s doing and puts major emphasis on being her own person and not being controlled   Beidou is her own boss and no one  not even Ningguang  is sitting in the background pulling the strings for her     She often breaks the rules in Liyue  often resulting in hefty fines from the Tianquan  but she does not appear to mind paying  despite having lost a significant amount of Mora doing so   She does what she wants  a heavy focus on keeping her own autonomy and living her life but is also ready to face the consequences    She is a good captain  getting along well with her entire crew  prioritizing the interests of her ship and crew first above everything else  While I m aware we shouldn t type through integration disintegration  she clearly shows a good amount of integration to    while in general having healthy   traits such as using her strength to help others and lead   I d love to see arguments for her being a   but I genuinely haven t seen any explanation as to why people thought that  it likely being more of a bandwagon vote due to the  healthy   adventurous Se dom  of it all ,estp
NE   people here legit forgetting Se     athletic     we need to kill that stereotype his Ne is too obvious  that connection he made that traveller must ve gotten the gnosis before him during the boss battle or that as well as how he is very creative in his battle style  just look at him in that cutscene where he was fighting those Ruin thingies or just his animations during the boss battle  him holding his water swords or just jumping     with his sword to attack everyone is only something NE could come up smh smh smh    Fi   he values the tsaristsa need I say more  he gave up his retribution in liyue for her if that aint true love I dont know what is  also he gets sympathetic that the traveler dosent have his power so he might sometimes join your team and from there his Fi is towards you  Te   he gets things done very quickly  why else would he be picked to be a harbinger if you couldn t be efficient  wanting to master every weapon to be efficient in fighting  seems to be pretty te  even his attacks are effect because they do so much damage and he even leaned to make water sword polearm  Si   he struggles with memory so much  we dont see it because its inferior  but basically  child seems to be traditional sometimes  he wants to uphold tsarinas s vision which may seem Ni  but its actually Tsaritsa s Ni bc she is doing the plans while child keeps that dream in the most traditional way possible Si affffff  also  I dont relate to him as an ESTP so he not ESTP,estp
annoying ass ginger who makes me cry for being the best big brother ever  Real ,estp
 This countertype acts against the gluttony that characterises the Seven  tending to mistype with Enneagram    They are generous and have a strong desire to be of service  to create a better world  They will sacrifice their own needs to serve the needs of a group or person they support  They can be judgemental regarding selfishness in themselves or others and they hope to be appreciated for their sacrifice    integrative   so     Are we really talking about the same person that summoned a ancient god to drown a city   And who has more than one voice line about how he ll conquer the world   So social   of him,estp
how is he   so    ive been reading about enneagram subtypes  aka iv  recently and no,estp
This is the first time I m visiting Childe s profil after learning about instinctual variants and where do you guys see  w  so sx  I feel like most people don t even read the descriptions for the instinctual variants  I m sure he s an  w  sx so and even if he s a  w  he would be sp sx and not so sx   Here are some descriptions from Beatrice Chestnut   Social      Social Sevens represents a kind of a pure character that  as the countertype of the Type Seven subtypes  expresses a kind of  counter gluttony   Social Sevens go against the Seven passion of gluttony in that they consciously avoid exploiting others  Naranjo says it s as if they can sense the tendency within themselves toward gluttony and decide to instead define themselves as antigluttonous  If gluttony is a wish for more  a wish for taking advantage of all you can get from a situation  there is a hint of exploitation in gluttony  But as the countertype  the Social subtype wants to be good and pure and not act on their gluttonous impulse  This is a person who wants to avoid being excessive or excessively opportunistic  and who works against any unconscious tendency they may have to exploit others   Social Sevens experience an inner taboo on selfishness and want to be seen as the  good child  or the  good person   They experience repressed guilt for hiding their self interest in the guise of good  and they may project their disowned guilt for their unacknowledged gluttony onto others  then judge them for not being committed or dedicated enough  These Sevens may also distrust themselves because they know they mix up altruism and self interest  they may judge their own deeper motivations as  bad  or  self interested    Doesn t sound like Childe at all right    Self Preservation      These Sevens are very practical  good at networking  and skilled at getting what they want and finding a good deal  they tend to be opportunistic  self interested  pragmatic  calculating  and clever  They readily recognize opportunities for creating an advantage for themselves  In this way  Naranjo explains  gluttony expresses itself in the Self Preservation Seven in an excessive concern with making a good deal at every opportunity   The dominant traits of the Self Preservation Seven subtype stand out as a love of pleasure and a self interested focus on getting what they need to feel secure  In seeking security  however  they can often confuse desires with needs  These are people who usually feel a need to have a lot of resources  including money and other supplies that support survival  and they may panic if they feel a sense of scarcity    Sounds way more like him  but I think the next one fits him more    Sexual       This outspoken  rebellious Eight likes to be sen as bad   or at least they don t mind it   and they tend not to feel any guilt over the rebellious things they do  It s almost a matter of pride for Sexual Eights to go against the stream of convention or to disrespect rules and laws   Sexual Eights express a need for dominance and power over others  They don t want to lose control of anything or anyone  and they want to influence people with their words  Everything   whether it is a person or a material thing  is an object to possess  These Eights don t seek material security  rather  they seek to get power over people  things  and situations    In getting and maintaining this power  Sexual Eights can be fascinating and charismatic  Their power comes through a kind of seductiveness and intensity that differentiates them stylistically from the other two Eight subtypes  As Naranjo explains  these Eights have more colors in their feathers  they are more magnetic and more outspoken  They have great powers of seduction    I think this fits him perfectly   I didn t put the full descriptions in here  but I strongly recommend to all of you to look them up and learn more about instinctual variants  I hope I could convince someone with this comment ,estp
i m still kind of obsessed with social   voters like there s NO WAY  social   is a countertype specifically known as counter gluttony  do y all really think childe puts his gluttony aside and avoids exploiting others  i mean cmon   if he really were a    sp   would probably be the way to go ,estp
my fav se dom  but i dont understand why yall vote him as a   more than  ,estp
People voting him  w   because usually  w  users are pretty toxic ,estp
why a social       qwertyuioiuytrewertyuio,estp
genuinely need to know why people voted him as  w ,estp
Are we still arguing over this  His Se is so clear  you just don t want to see it because ENTP sounds more cool  weird and alternative    His playing style is entirely based on Se  it s literally called guess blocking  I agree that the playing style and the person are not the same thing  but as a volleyball player i can tell you that there s a big correlation  And he also shows it really clearly with the motive behind playing volleyball  he likes it because it makes him feel good at the moment  There wouldn t even be an argument if he didn t act that  weird   out of ordinary  and  as a monster  please be a little bit objective,estp
why so sx  i just want to know,estp
I swear he is such a Se dom  I love to see it,estp
this guys character is literally exploring his Se Ni  I love him so muCh,estp
he s so obviously an ESTP idk what u guys r saying calling him an ENTP lol  ive seen a few  oh  just bc he has good reflexes doesn t make him an ESTP   but in a way it kind of does  he has an incredible idea of his surroundings at all times  as someone who has played volleyball in the past  you need to have developed Se ability to play front row like he does  Ne doms are more worried about the  why  of their surroundings more than the  what  who  where   details  he clearly does not care why the court is the way it is  he just plays by what he sees  Se   he also definitely has Fe Fi  as the main reason he does what he does is because of his surroundings and external reasons  not because of what he personally thinks to do   such an obvious   as well  he has literally said the main reason he plays volleyball is because it s fun  not for success or fame or anything like that  but simply because he likes it  he does everything for fun  i love him lmao,estp
I have to agree that when they introduced him with the whole   guess monster   i thought he d be a Ne dom  But honestly  he blocks the spikers based on how automatically he thinks the spiker is going to be and takes the opportunity no matter if the guess was correct or not  In his backstory i think they specifically said that  That sounds a lot of Se Ti to me ,estp
i m rewatching season   rn and i think he is the most enneagram   character i ve ever seen in my entire life   if it doesn t feel good while playing why bother  he does EVERYTHING just for enjoyment and to avoid any of the negative feelings other things arise in him  there s quite a few other examples but i can t think of them off of the top of my head right now,estp
Having good reflexes doesn t mean being a Se dom  at the end this is a sports anime  He is clearly a Ne user from what we saw in his life and his playstyle  most of the things he does are raw intuition and a very good Si despite being a inferior function for ENTP,estp
Dominant Se is more than just witnessing sensory occurrence  it s an overall preference toward objective sensory data   In going from  many to one   Se seizes and captures the facts of external reality on its own terms to gain full awareness of the immediate environment  setting the stage for quick action  As the diagrams indicate  of all the perception functions its the one based in external reality     Boye Akinwande  http   ojjt org         illustrating function axes   Noticing subtle details isn t exclusive to Se  and is in fact more typically correlated with Si processes  however the way he does such and his overall preference to such data indicates that this was derived from an Se process    Full awareness is what he achieves  not meticulous recollection observation in accordance with sensory data from a subjective standpoint  Si   nor does he really explore the breadth of his surroundings and the notions within it  Ne    His blocking style utilizes calculation  as well as full awareness of such objective factors  Demonstrating an affinity for generating calculative deductions he derives from such objective factors  As he questions   Blocking is all about calculation and sense of smell  right    Ni is more than simply predicting  as Boye Akinwande stated  Ni is more orientated   toward  inwardly associating and synthesizing data to arrive at holistic mental representations and noumena that transcend the immediate reality   As such  Ni is also associated with underlyings means  and thus  I could see this correlating with his liking for volleyball  Like Nishinoya  he cares for his present but doesn t necessarily grasp onto such with the desire to retain continuity  But rather  he puts meaning into what he does pursue and continually manifests such hobbies and passions until he eventually has to let go  and he does so with few qualms in regards to letting go of these things he holds dear  From my interpretation  this indicates a full acceptance of that which is concrete  and the correlation with such meanings that these passions bring to him is a product of Se s tendency to seek out sensory enjoyment and Ni s tendency to gain a hold of meanings  Simple as it may seem  his line   Farewell  my paradise    demonstrates the relation between such beautifully   Well  I hope this provides more perspective on the consensus ESTP vote ,estp
Ok so I understand that it s hard to spot fe in him  but keep in mind that is inosuke s third function in his stack  so it might not be as evidently shown in his personality   I do think he starts to show fe as he meets people and feels connections with them  because he never needed to feel empathy when growing up alone in the mountains   However  I believe he does use ti  To start off  introverted thinking is more subjective than extroverted thinking  and inosuke s methods for doing things seem to be more on what he sees as logical  rather than morally correct   Instead of referencing external protocols and  doing things by the book   Te   Ti is confident in its ability to spontaneously and independently figure things out   Inosuke has learned what works for him  and functions using his own make up of how his environment functions  Just because he doesn t use his head doesn t mean he s an ESFP  as his enneagram makes up for the gut situation  He manufactures his own internal standards of the world  and uses that to spontaneously act in situations  Don t get me wrong  I m not opposed to the ESFP arguments  as I definitely think he s a se dom  but I just believe inosuke uses ti ,estp
Inosuke  o ESTP que ODEIA ser racional kkkkk piada Ele sempre deixa claro que odeia pensar demais nas coisas  sempre vai no impulso e se deixando levar pelos sentidos e sentimentos   E eu acho ele bem parecido com a Power de Chainsaw Man que tamb m   ESFP  e acho que  w  combina mt mais com ele  n o vejo ambi  o nenhuma nele pra ser  w   que   um eneagrama pra personagens mt ambiciosos que sonham alto e fazem de tudo pra alcan ar seus objetivos  n o vejo inosuke assim  ele   mt mais o estere tipo  w  raivoso e energ tico  sem muita complexidade  Ele s  tinha uma ambi  o no in cio  derrotar tanjiro mas com o tempo ele foi esquecendo e amolecendo  virando amigo de Tanjiro etc etc,estp
Ti Fe    theres no way erm,estp
Where s the Ti and the Fe,estp
Fe ,estp
 Using my head  That s not like me at all     Dammit Tonjero  your gonna make me use my head again  ain t cha      yaawwwnm  ugghh that s enough thinking for one day   passes out   Ah yes  things Ti users say ,estp
Inosuke is an    I always saw him as a    or at least that was my first initiate view of him   I didn t finish the entire series yet but  I was pretty convinced that he was a  w   the way he loves to compete with others and try to find a strong point within fighting and winning despite being chaotic with it  He never admits defeat  even when he is really weak and cannot emotionally accept it at all  Maybe I got some wrong idea  IDK can someone explain  Anywho I love  s anyways so I m happy with either type   Anywho other then that yeah I love this guy  Favorite Se dom in all anime history LOL ,estp
I haven t watched the demon slayer movies  so feel free to disagree with me on the Fi Fe argument   No one actually seems to be giving good examples of Inosukes functions    For those who keep on saying  ESTP voters lack reasons for why Insouke has Ti  or  ESFP voters are wrong for saying Inosuke has Fi  just stop  You re spamming the thread and hiding comments that are actually thorough and helpful and being immature  If you want to prove something or someone wrong  use some objective thinking   Anyways  here is my analysis of Inosuke s functions   Most likely  he is in a Se Te loop  I don t see many Fi usages  such as acceptance rejection based on one s feelings and values  Fe is also pretty unlikely  I m also taking in the fact Inosuke grew up in the mountains with boars  but Inosuke never makes others  needs and emotions a priority or commits any sort of emotional manipulation   So it leaves it down to his Ti and Te   Many ESTP voters mistook his Ti for Te  Here s why   The first time Inosuke saw a train  he sees it as a threat because of its appearance and size  Te thinking is very inductive  seeing general principles behind specific occurrences    An example of inductive thinking  They are carrying a weapon so they re probably dangerous because dangerous people carry weapons  Or  they re loud so they are probably extraverted because the majority of extroverts are loud  Inosuke s thinking   It s loud and big  with many people going inside its hole  it must be eating them  It s dangerous   very Te reasoning   Ti users use deductive reasoning instead  deductive reasoning is coming to conclusions based only on the information given   Examples of deductive thinking  Humans are mortal  John is a human  Therefore  John is mortal  Or  Kaylee is quiet  Introverts and extroverts can both be quiet  but there is a stereotype introverts are quiet  But based on the information given  Kaylee could be an introvert but also could be an extrovert  Ti users would reason the train like this   It is long  big  and noisy with people going in and out  But there is no one injured or scared  Long  big  and noisy doesn t nessasarily mean a threat  because anything can be    But Inosuke quickly jumped to conclusion using Te   Another example is after the Kyogai fight  Inosuke refuses to help Tanjiro and Zenitsu bury the dead bodies  because he sees no POINT in it  indicating he hates inefficiency  Ti users would bury it because dead bodies attract rodents and bugs  making a gross mess  Inosuke couldn t understand it on a Fe level either  Then Tajiro said Inosuke won t help because his injuries hurt  Inosuke immediately joins in burying bodies  saying he will bury more than both of them    Inosuke did that because a  he didn t want to be seen as incapable and inferior  b  was because he wanted to empirically prove he wasn t hurt  Te is objective and clear   c  he set an impulsive goal to do better than both of them  Ti usage wouldn t have a Reason to do that   When Hisa  the old lady that offered demon slayers a rest house  started sparks as a sign of good luck  Inosuke immediately went nuts   Because Te logic  Fire  burning   danger   must stop   ESTP voters who say  Inosuke jagged his sword because it aligned with his own internal logic system  Inosuke did that to slice up demons as it efficiently cuts through their skin  while also showing Inosuke s ferociousness   Inosuke seems to be on a Se Te hiatus  hopefully we get to see his Fi soon ,estp
Hey guys  can y all actually give arguments from the show movie manga instead of  what  He s the most ESxP person ever   with examples  Here s an old one of mine as a reference that y all should do as well if we really want to come to agreement    Ti   Picture a giant jigsaw puzzle  Ti users take all the data or information given to them via their perceiving functions and compare it  This may be conscious or subconscious  and the data may be accurate or inaccurate  The more they learn  the larger and more elaborate the puzzle gets  They will take all of the information that they ve deemed consistent and put it in their database of knowledge  or study out anything they re uncertain about to learn exactly if and where it belongs  Every piece belongs somewhere  Unfortunately  since all of this information is interconnected and dependent  there s a problem when they learn one piece of seemingly trustworthy data is actually inconsistent with something else within their database    Fi   Introverted feelers focus on how the external world  people  or situations make them feel personally  Based on these feelings  they develop their own internal value system of what they have deemed to be good or bad  Every piece of information fed to them by their perceiving functions is then judged against this value system  It is then accepted or discarded based on how it measures up  Anything contrary to their value system is contrary to their own feelings and thus must be rejected  Because of this internal focus  their self worth becomes wrapped up in whether or not they are remaining true to themselves    He has no Ti to speak of  every decision he makes has core purpose to build and enforce his his identity  He flips out whenever someone tries to make him do something that does not resonate with him or who he is   When he wakes up to find Tonjero having a ceremony honoring the fallen  he is at disbelief cuz he has zero understanding of group harmony and shared values aka   Fe   All he desires is to follow his own passions Fi   he does not seek knowledge to use as a tool Ti    Ti seeks accuracy and to learn how things work on a deeper level  Fi seeks to find one s identity and value    Some argue he uses Ti cuz he s logical  Excuse me  First off  anyone can be logical and have their own opinions  but that isn t Ti  Second  Inosuke isn t logical at all  He has no interest in finding a logical reason in why he wants to fight  other than to test his strength against others demons for his own value identity Fi   One thing an xxTP would never say is  Using my head  that s not like me at all    Idk how that s not a dead giveaway that he s completely Ti blind  Even Tonjero s ENFJ  Ti is better    Every insult or complement he receives  he doesn t care exchange them  but he reacts to how it makes him feel   It s usually    AHAHHHHAGGGGGAAAHHHALLLGHGGEH  or     oooOOOGGggggouuuuoUgghhh    His Fi is so obvious it hurts  his values are not externally stimulated  I dont understand you ESTP voters  ,estp
ni dom   pls  no way  but between ISTP and ESTP  im going to go with ESTP  bc yes  his ti and se are extremely balanced  but his fe is amazingly noticeable and healthy to be inferior imo,estp
La verdad es que me confunde el draken con su i o e    ,estp
Why the fck SLI  Hello  How is he an Si base in socionics       What the actual fck     Man loves both violence and being in the right over harmony   He strikes me as a Ti base  Ofc his Ti being all about serving Mikey  And having Se creative  being subservient to his Ti base which is why he s not crazy like a full fledged Se base such as SLE ,estp
A question for INFJ voters  why Se inferior ,estp
I couldn t really find a good argument for INFJ  I understand why some people voted ISTP  but INFJ  really    ,estp
ah yes  cause apparently xstps are incapable of caring for others and being respectful LMAOOOOO yall INFJ voters w the ESTP stereotypes in the comments  saying he isn t wild or fun seeking and Too CaLM to be ESTP    he s just a ESTP with good fe that isn t a   or   lmao ,estp
i literally went through more than half the comments  i DID NOT find one INFJ arguement that said why he is ni dom in anyway   or literally any arguement at all   the problem here tho is HOW is there  k INFJ VOTES MEANWHILE NOBODY IS ARGUING FOR INFJ except like     comments   ISTP votes r okay ig but how is there literally  k INFJ votes where did those come from theyre not even commenting  goodnight    also so my comment isnt a total me complaining  can an ISTP voter explain his fe INFERIOR  TI DOM  are you guys sure youre not confusing his introversion with core    which tends to be quite introverted at times  so thats why ure voting ISTP  ,estp
      Hmm as far as his enneagram  could definitely go either way between   and    I m not saying there s anything wrong with  w  and I m sure it s just as likely  No matter how you look at it  I think Draken just has a strong wing  but what do y all think of him just being a well balanced  relatively healthy  w   From what I ve come to find  you might be also be surprised to find that both  w s and  w s actually exhibit very similar behaviors and tendencies  both can sometimes vacillate between a calm passivity and being confrontational hot headed  depending on how heavy the wing is   both tend to struggle with anger temper problems     The biggest thing when it comes to the enneagram is to look at the underlying reasons motives for said behavior though  Sure  both can want to avoid be averse to being controlled  but a core   is more action oriented and I think would more proactively try to secure themselves in a position of power or be in control so they aren t controlled themselves   w s I ve noticed tend to just get angry become hostile when you disrespect their autonomy their boundaries  I ll contrast him with Mikey  a  w  for example  when he loses his      and his personal resentment erupts with Kazotoru for killing his brother    then almist kills him by beating him to a bloody pulp   w s will take charge if necessary but I ve found they re a lot less concerned with having power  Mikey for example will shift his carefree  playful  ish demeanor to imposing and commanding with Toman  not out of any apparent influence of power and control  that we know of   but because he views himself as the pillar of Toman   Mikey s motives for this are also very other focused   and sx   based  rooted in his brither s influence    he s doing it for the sake and personal pride in his gang members  Also  when Mikey surrounds himself with the wrong people later on  he begins to exhibit more impressionable  unhealthy sx   tendencies    I should also add It s not like core  s  at least healthy ones  even like conflict or go around looking for it  but they ll assert their dominance and won t hesitiate to put you in your place if you cross the line XD   w s in general can initially appear calm and reserved  more like  w s or  s  but shift to an intimidating aura erupt in angry bursts if you cross the line  I think this sounds like Draken  no  He doesn t exactly seem conflict avoidant or like he s motivated by any desire for peace  I believe he bowed down to the family in the hospital  also ironically puts Mikey in his place and forces him to show the same respect  and lets Pa chin turn himself in  not out of any motive for peace or because he s giving up his personal power  but simply because it was the right thing to do  understood the father s rage  and wanted to own up and take personal responsibility for it  even if he wasn t directly a part if it   w s can know that sometimes there is true strength in surrendering their personal power   Also  during the battle of the Bloody Halloween  even though the odds were against the Manji gang and the members were starting to get discouraged  he was able to turn them around and inspire a renewed tenacity and confidence in their side when he turned the odds around in their favor  cont  in comment below   ,estp
I don t think Draken is ESTP  He s look more like ISTP and he s impossible INFJ,estp
he s a quiet introverted ESTP  it s possible  read about it  it s a lifestyle  There s no way draken is ISTP  espicially with how he treat strangers for example the first time he met mikey and matsuya ,estp
yeah   her dominant Se is incredibly obvious  she s really open about the fact that she is addicted to sensory experiences  specifically the rush she gets from gambling   and rather than try and compartmentalize and deconstruct these experiences  she expands upon them eternally  SUPER MEGA SE  she is quite literally Se on crack    she mainly lives through sensations evoked within herself  clearly indicative of S dominant  but in socionics land   this trait of hers means shes a type which values Si  ILE makes sense ig ,estp
Why ESTP  Her Fe   Ni looks like so high,estp
I have saw only the anime and not all the manga except for some pages but for what i will describe her for what I can say  Se  Ne   Yumeko looks for the concrete reality like  here and now    she is always excited from tangible sensation  her character in every season is based in the present moment  from an actual experience  she always makes focus her actions of the people for face them in effective way  Of course Se doms can think to abstract ideas  but  they never trust from things that it can t be demonstrated or irrealistic without proof or illustrations in real world  I never says her to explore or try to understand various possibilities with a faceted vision of the world  difference future scenarios  what if ecc     Ti  she uses it and does a detached logical analysis in every match against others and make theme A sense and a universal internal coherence  expecially in the first episodes and the match against Mary      After some testing I got suspicious  whenever the stakes were high you had the best cards  whenever it was low  you let the cards be random  I had to find out which card was reproduced several times  he was checking what those present were drawing  if those people would not have drawn the same thing they could not have cheated  there was no logical pattern because it would have been too difficult to memorize the order for the duration of the game  then someone behind me communicated the card to be drawn  I saw it thanks to a mirror   CONTINUE OVER THIS COMMENT,estp
Why not Sanguine Phlegmatic  She acts too calm during her interactions to be a Sanguine  Dominant ,estp
Why sx so  I don t see any social   on her    Also there s no way she has a       as body fix   ,estp
Why does this website never get their Myers Briggs right https   www cbr com kakegurui yumeko jabami mbti personality type ,estp
omg ENTP makes no sense  her se is so damn obvious  she is very present and attuned to the physical environment  Also  please stop stereotyping ESxP s or any sensors in general as DUMB  I mean  anyone can be intelligent  anyone can be dumb  I swear ik xxTJ s who can be really dumb  Also her ti is very obvious  The way she uses her logic is very subjective and she finds out if someone is cheating by using her internal logic  u can also see the fe tert    also why sx so   i mean even before watching kakegurui i expected her to be an sp   but i didnt watch before so i wasnt able to judge but now i watched some eps of the show and her sp   is so obvious lol  Stop voting sx   bcs shes h rny  Imo  sp   s can be really h rny too its not that all sp   s are h rny dont worry but im saying that some of them are   her sp   is so obvious   also some people said shes an     or     or     whatever  imo i see a  w  fix  tbh i dont really see much   in her despite being all crazy for gambling and creepy  she has a  w  fix so  w  s are very   like tbh  also  i dont see a   fix  she doesnt actually desire to be successful or something whatever   desire  also triple positive makes sense tbh  thats why i think shes       w   w   w  basically ,estp
Maybe she is ESTP or ESFP,estp
These are her stems       These are the expansive  competent  visionary Sevens  Result oriented  good at planning and execution  Can be narcissistic and inconsiderate of people when it comes to having fun  getting their way or executing their visions at work  Idealism may conflict with the Three s attitude of doing what it takes to be successful        Aggressive  they do not back down when they have a goal in their sights and work relentlessly till they have achieved what they want  They hurtle through with a mix of disarming charm and disquieting power through most rooms  commanding the attention of others  Dominating and gregarious  can be inconsiderate  tenderize emotions lest they come in the way of success  These individuals will want not only popularity  but also use it as a means to accumulate power and influence  Extremely charming and glib  may have problems with fidelity in relationships unless they find a mate who can go head to head with them  and earn their respect ,estp
ne ti voters whatt    yumeko uses whats around her to make decisions when she is gambling  thats all there is to it  shes very good at taking in her surrondings and using ti to rationalize and find logical patterns with that  fe is clear in the way that she puts on her poker face  shes very good at gathering a groups overall emotions and deciding how to react to that so she can win the gamble  inferior ni makes total sense as well  all of her moments of conclusion are not made in the subconsious  its based in persent reality  this isnt to say she doenst use ni  because it IS in her stack  I think the way she explains her logic behind her gamvles and her connecting the patterns she sees is very ti ni ,estp
this comment section is genuinely making me lose braincells,estp
Hes an edfj cuz i said so,estp
 Alcohol is cool  But have you ever had someone care about you  Me neither  Pass the bottle    This quote screams Chuuya      brocken  pain,estp

why is he a SLUEN over SLOEN  tbh i dont have arguments against either so idk,estp
I ve already made a comment like this but this is one of the worst cases I ve seen      How could someone with an Inferior intuition function be a type    Type   heavily revolves around intuitive like expressions  Reminder that type   is quite possibly the most intellectual of the ennea types due to their skeptical and theoretical nature that moves away from realism  eg  hyper vigilance  that is on the lookout for hidden meanings  clues  and the unusual   Not only is the ineffectualness or generalized problem with doing of the more timid Type VI individuals a consequence of an excessive orientation to the abstract and theoretical  but seeking refuge in intellectual activity is also a consequence of fearful holding back  indirectness  vagueness  and beating around the bush       Sensation is not necessarily related to the   senses  but these are used to actually do the sensing   but it is the raw apprehension of what is merely there  like a cognitive news report  constantly letting one know of what s happening in the present       Intuition is creative observation  prediction  a completion of implied patterns  that fills in the blanks and connects the dots of something that lies beyond the mere sensation  it perceives the implied  not the apparent       Sensation is concerned with the concrete  realistic details  It is concerned with given information  That is  information that is specified and explicit  So overall  sensation is a focus on the concrete reality of things  In Michael Pierce s words  sensation perceives the actual current nature of a thing  Much like extroversion  sensation is quite straightforward  so all that can be said about it is quite clear and simple  ,estp
He is so reactive to emotions  Voted ESFP,estp
Ele e ISTP ele n o   extrovertido,estp
In end game he has mood swings if you look at his previous movies you can see the difference,estp
His character develops a lotttt over the course of these movies  at many points showing strong Ti and Fi use  he has both    He s Fi dom  though  and you can see it in his relationships    Avengers   that play it as a joke  but he actually  maybe subconsciously  considers himself to be the most important avenger on the team  Fi users relate things to themselves to be productive   He always has a plan and sees it has different  more effective than other peoples   Te aux     Loki   THIS IS WHAT CONVINCED ME  Thor always goes back to Loki  regardless of Loki s moral standing  It s basically  murder as many people as you want  we re always going to be brothers   BUT Thor recognises their differences in a sense of good and bad  Fi   If he were to use Te Ti more  there would be more criticism of Loki s behaviour    Again  he uses strong Ti so ESTP is a legit option  but his personal and social standings really make me thing ESFP ,estp
he s an ESFP i highly disagree with these votes  I think it s most evident in the first avengers movie  He acts makes decisions on his feelings  I think hes definitely a feeler ,estp
I understand the votes for Three  but in Infinity War and Endgame it s obvious how positively Thor is  like a real Seven  he looks more like a Seven than Stark does  honestly ,estp
i think his functions look different in ragnarok than the other movies but he s definitely more fi than ti,estp
i think he s an ESTP who prefers Fe over Ti  a comment below  scroll  showed how his  that s what heroes do  quote is indicative of an Fe external code of honor he follows  idk i thought it was telling,estp
all i m saying is  i find it funny how ESFP voters get very heated about nobody providing arguments for ESTP  but when people do they  ignore it  and continue to complain    i know thor was an ESFP before ragnarok  he was undeniably so  after ragnarok is a different story  ragnarok changed the game for both thor and loki  and their functions are not the same ,estp
I totally agree on Thor being Se dom  but he has wayyyy too much Fi to be ESTP  And he has way too little Ti for it to be Auxiliary  Plus there is absolutely NO way Fe is Tertiary  This is messed up  and I haven t seen one valid ESTP argument out there  Yeah  it s kind of true that I wish Thor was ESTP but there is just no way in hell ,estp
i laughed so hard when i saw     people voted him as ENTP,estp
yesss hanma shuji is SE dom guyssssss finally,estp
i genuinely want to know where ppl are getting ne from when voting him as an ENTP   ,estp
this mf has no ne what are you ENTP voters on about,estp
En serio decis de Hanma no es ENTP  As  va Espa a,estp
Funny how this guy has more Ne than Mikey,estp
I have yet to see one argument for Ne,estp
for me  i haven t finished tokyo revengers yet but i do believe he s an ESTP over ENTP  he s a strong Se user  most Tokyo revengers characters  minus a few  have strong Se  instead of using his past to inspire him or build upon his project  he s more focused on doing things NOW rather than later  correct me if im wrong but that s Se   Ne,estp
at this point i feel like ENTP voters type by letters because like wtf his se is obvious asf,estp
Why are we fighting over the most mid character in this manga  I wish that he was an ENTP  that s the unique way of making him interesting,estp
She is an ENTP as an ENTP person say that because her personality with every one is show her filings with smiling and say bullshits at the same time i dont undrestand people who says she is an f type,estp
every  arguing abt se or ne  its clearly se cmon man  most ne doms atleast give a lil hont of qUIrkE and she gave none of that  but where is the ti  theres barely fe either  especially at her age  fe terts try to develop it  Her actions was never backed up by her logic ,estp
Okay my thoughts about her     She s definetly a Se dom  I don t see any Ne  Ti or Fe in her      all I see is Se Fi  her Fi is pretty strong   At first she was somehow selfish  egoistic and arrogant   an unhealthy ESFP   she was only interested in anything that would only benefit her and  darling   but later got a lil development and became a  stable  ESFP  not gonna say healthy because she was mostly used for fanservice and actually got very little character development   I m mostly confused about her enneagram as I can see  w    w    w  or even  w   please tell me your opnions about this ,estp
Zero Two instead of ESTP  in my opinion  she should have an ENFP because of her N  where she constantly thinks about the future  about changing into a human  and the way it describes everything and views everything fits well under N  Sometimes she was thoughtful  and these are the things that don t suit S  Also  F suits her better than T because of her beliefs about being transformed into a human and about a prince in a book  She made decisions based on her own beliefs and emotions ,estp
ugh ENTP votes increasing    during the whole show i couldn t see any ne at her  she is very good with   senses  pratical  likes taking risks  jumping into the action and good at physical things  she never thinks about possibilities and the results of situations ,estp
     Se dom Arguments     From my part   Se and Ne cognitive process are very differently but have similar behaviors  both seek freedom  experience the world and are usually impulsive  so focuse on the cognitive process in the behaviorism behind and not only in the behavior   Se focuses more on the   senses and how perceives the concrete world while Ne focuses more on the multiple possibilities about some object and start to disperse and expand ideas through it and Zero Two processes further with Se                                                                                                                Ne cares more about possibilities than living in the moment zero two doesn t care about the possibility and she just jumps right into an action Also she didn t want to  think abstractly  she just listened to papa saying that she needs to kill klaxos to become human and the only reason she wanted to stray away is that she wanted to meet her old darling and to be accepted by everyone because of her trauma   Every type wants to be loved for who they are and I personally see more inferior Ni than Si because zero two never cared about the consequences of her actions I don t see how she used inferior Si outside of her trauma that happened in her past which isn t really Si inferior anyway everyone can remember the trauma they had                                                                                                                She needs external physical stimuli before get an Intuitive comprehension  In the start of Anime appears that  she wants to take a shower on the ocean ignoring the consequences   very impulsive in the fights Don t think at the consequences and only wants to act   In a talk with Hiro  it s interesting that she sayed that  before  I thinked that to be human I need to have an aparence of human   That is  she saw aesthetics before the meaning    She is very impulsive to be simple a Ne dom  Ni grip in the attempt to be human  not Si  because the motif it s her individual future  and not the past memories   she is obsessive to be human I can compare this grip with Anakin Skywalker  that be obsessive to save Padm  from Death   She don t divagues in Meta physic consciently  And She don t think before act in fights  Hiro tries to do this part   Well  remember that she licks the people to see his emotions  the same for Princess Kloxosaur  that also is an Se user      add   Right she s all about instincts  annoyingly impulsive and bases her decisions and ideas mainly on what s concrete  real  material and present   Can t see Ne at all in her attitude  especially when she fights  she s aware that she s strong so she blindly attacks violently most of the time                                                                                                                Let s see if she uses Se    Freely follow your gut instincts and exciting physical impulses as they come up    Obviously    Enjoy the thrill of action and physical experience in the present moment    Of course    Instantly read visible cues to see just how far you can go    I think so  yes    Spur action and pull off results simply by making your presence felt    Yes    Easily get in sync physically with people and things around you    Definitely    Conclusion  Zero Two is Se incarnated    I would also consider ESFP though                                                                                                                she s a high Se user  constantly looking for the thrill of things  doing dangerous and wild things not out of curiosity or opportunity but because of its sensory feeling  please give an example of when she s theorized or analyzed anything  when she is  philosophical  she is merely reflecting back on her past experience and her previous thoughts  most of which revolve around trauma and not understanding certain events  don t say sensors can t question things  zero two doesn t care about theory or possibility  she acts in the spur of the moment  caring only about the present  her experience  and their senses ,estp
Why is she  w  and not  w   Her desire is to find her darling and have a stable life with him  she is not really domineering and mostly shows her compassion to the children    She is pushy but that is as fast as she goes  she does think a lot about being loyal and find the one  we thought she had kissed another guy or even sleep with another pilot but that is not true  Even she lost her memories  she never cares about the guy that doesn t meet her expectation  and thinks of them are just sidekicks to pilot franxx    Many enneagrams   are loyal and seek stability  I think in the end she is a true   because she never goes too deep with other guys except Hiro  She even proves no one can be with her except Hiro  This is Ni as fxck  even she lost memories she get an idea that Hiro is the one  however eventually she lost all hope because even Hiro couldn t pilot franxx with her  that is when she show her demonic self  unhealthy   ,estp
Ne just like Se also live in the moment  It s her desire for new experiences and tendency to think abstractly and stray from the norm that makes her ENTP and not ESTP  I don t see any Ni in her as well  but her Ne Si makes a lot of sense ,estp
I was making a comment about ENTPs getting typed as ESTPs or even ENFPs because of the stereotype of there not being a lot of female ENTPs  my comment was satirical not literal  I have my reasons for believing Zero Two uses Ne Ti instead of Se Ti but I won t turn a deaf ear if someone has a better argument I would change my vote  I ve read arguments in the comment section  and maybe I m not scrolling deep enough to find the good ones that are persuading me ,estp
Interesting  I never watched Darling in the Franxx but I always heard that Zero Two was an ENTP  sometimes I and INTP can relate with a lot of ENTP s but the clips that I watched about Zero Two seemed odd to me  I couldn t see why she was an ENTP  but I didn t care a lot because I didn t watch the anime  now I see she is typed as ESTP  can someone explain me why people used to believe she was an ENTP or why is now believed she is ESTP ,estp
 Spoiler ish  He is definitely not a    i think people are just seeing his unhealthy Fe when he analyzes people and mistaken it as   core attributes  Also  in an alternative scenario  does everyone think he might possible run into Emily in Paris for season   and maybe kill her  Or just get bored of her ,infj
OMG PLEASE  HE IS NOT A SX    sx   is this very outgoing  aggressive  intense  overtly sexual and seductive  prideful  histrionic  dramatic  bombastic person  They are nothing like Joe  Joe puts on a  nice guy  persona to attract people  He draws not draw them in with sexual magnetism   HOW IS THIS JOE   He is not a so   either  they are more about influencing groups  whole communities  who wants to lead and be the centre of entire social environments  but have a hard time with individuals  This is not Joe  he is obsessed with individuals  just like the sx    If you vote   still then you need your skull checked ,infj
    I m not going to lie  I m incredibly surprised that he s typed as   or   core  I suppose it s because of his hidden emotionality  but I won t make assumptions  Instead  I m going to try to prove why I think Joe is a sexual      As always in my arguments  Let s start off by comparing the heart triad and the head triad    Heart triad     Also called image points  these are people who have sold out their essential being to an image that seems to be required by society  Often the most beautiful people on the Enneagram  the image points have created themselves in the image they have been taught we will love    The thing with heart triad enneatypes   is that they create their image in order to cope with their inner hatred  which is something Joe does not do  He doesn t crave approval or acceptance  everything he has done was mostly for coverage of suspicion  and to simply  get by   since he always believed he was doing what was right    Head Triad     Sometimes called the  doing  group  these people are always dealing with a strong polarity between doing and trying to decide what to do  This is also the home of internal dialogue    Joe definitely experiences internal dialogue A LOT  He often wonders what he should do next so he doesn t  mess anything up  and he desperately tries to moralize his every objectively wrong action with his intellect  trying not to let his emotions take the lead    Let s take a look at the sexual   which in my opinion seems like a perfect fit    We have to understand this passionate search in the sense of trusting  of being able to trust the other  the sexual E  is looking for that person who will be for him and with him  no matter the how or what  far beyond the normal vows of an engagement or a marriage   The thought of the sexual five is that he has to be able to present himself to you with the worst of his inner world  and that you  as his partner  should maintain complete equanimity in the face of his inner monsters  since he loves you so much       Who knew sharing my darkest secrets would make me feel so light       Everything I told you  is true  Beck  Henderson  Delilah  I killed them  Their blood is on my hands     They can be very much like the other Fives until you hit the romantic point  then a vibrant inner life will awaken       Turns out  it is like the movies  The second it s over  all you can remember is the stuff that made you fall in love  Blazing through your mind  this romcom montage made of the sweetest poison  I d never felt this way before  where you love the bad things about someone just as much as the good  Maybe even more     Of course  as we all know  for Joe the  breaking point  would be his first meeting with Beck    or Candace  honestly whichever you prefer  it doesn t matter a lot here  since he always said that it was the first time he felt this way  Before  he was just  hiding  in his inner world along with books that brought him satisfaction      CONTINUATION IN THE REPLIES  ,infj
Ni is apparent   those internal monologues of him is so Ni lol,infj
He is not INFJ    He is a total Si dom ,infj
my god noooooo just noooooo he s not INFJ at all he s INTJ in my view  i just know he s not INFJ,infj
This is truly depressing  You d think a character so primarily focused on E  fixations would be unanimously agreed as    However  people think      You guys need to realise   don t individualise themselves  That s a   thing  And that s what Joe does in every single monologue  He mentions idealism  the ideal mate  and going to all ends to reach his ideals  If this isn t type   conflict  I don t know what is   Hurr durr  he wants to be loved      You guys realise  even sx s  are the types who constantly put themselves on for show  try to bring people in with their physical desirability  What happens when Joe has the spotlight  He seethes internally  He cares too much about authenticity and authentic connections to be a    It s not a matter of being loved or wanted  it s a matter of finding the right mate for his unrealistic standards  P S  all heart types want to be loved   And here are literally the ego fixations of E      Fixation  Melancholy Never happy with the present  always looking toward a happy future   Trap  Authenticity For this person  the really real mate will always be just around the comer of the next hour or day  or year  With such a mate  this person will then be fulfilled and so authentic   Holy Idea  Holy Origin Once he realizes that his essence originates from perfect being  then he knows that he is  really real  now  and not sometime in the future   Passion  Envy The Ego Melancholy person  hoping for the perfect mate or situation in order to feel really real and fulfilled  tends to think most others have achieved this and  of course  is envious of their seeming happiness and earthiness   Virtue  Equanimity Happiness in the present moment or equanimity will help overcome the envy of the happiness of others   You guys think this esoteric  hopeless romantic is the Maddy Perez esque  attention seeking sx     Let s look at type   fixations    Ego Flat Fixation  Flattery Needs an approving audience  Many entertainers belong to this group   Ah yes  the same guy who was at immense discomfort when he was getting his picture taken is ego flat  Totally      Trap  Freedom Although dependent upon others for constant approval of himself and his actions  he is fighting that dependency in order to be free from social disapproval and approval    Yup  Joe  the esoteric edgelord with clumsy social skills  the same guy who constantly judges others for their inauthenticity  same guy who hates unwanted attention and is more focused on ideal mate than social approval is a     Albeit  subtypes can distort  so  for sx   it d be more about categorical beauty and desirability  Often found in models  You know Joe  such an approval seeking person in terms of his physical attractiveness  He s definitely not motivated by aforementioned E  fixations or this    Fours are searching for ideal attention    a partner who completely understands and appreciates them  Fours focus on what s missing in others and in themselves  Despite their longing for an ideal partner  their actual partner has flaws and isn t quite what the Four is looking for  Fours seek validation and attention from others  but feel they must be different and distant from others to get it  As a result  their strategy for attention doesn t often work  leading to a sense of frustration that maintains their sense of self    In fact  he s such a positivist  non brooding type    like so    Twos reject their own needs  their own negative thoughts and emotions  The Two offers the only gift she has left  her heart  She focuses on the needs of others and helping  caring  and nurturing them  Twos try to love others so much that others won t reject them  Twos base their sense of self on putting their own needs aside  rejection  and caring for others   despite literally going off of Love when she no longer met his standards or perceived unfit for him  Yeah  so neglectful of his own needs and an avid supporter  putting his partner s needs first all the time  Most definitely his overarching flaw  his altruism rather than his obvious toxic idealism   Seriously  what are these   votes  Is there an actual rebuttal to this argument  Because I ve seem Tf if I know make the same one before  And little to no people actually rebutted  just ignored and still insist E   It s ridiculous ,infj
this is absolutely crazy and you all just don t know enneagram  everyone who wants to be loved is a   in all of your eyes  i ve never been so annoyed at a mistype ,infj
Joe is obviously one of the biggest sx   s   One five with this subtype described especially appreciating the experience of  clicking  with someone  the feeling of having chemistry with another person  saying that when he felt this he could become infatuated very quickly  ,infj
Guys settle on something already    His enneagram is literally changing everyday         ,infj
I agree with E   so sp  So   has a   ish temperament and they are good teachers   but what is the wing   EDIT  he seems a type   but just because he has  sp  as secondary instinct  Idk about his tritype  I can t choose between   and     Sp       The true perfectionist who worries a lot  wants things under control and tries to anticipate risks and problems  SP Ones have a strong inner critic and are hard on themselves  with a heightened sense of responsibility  They are often anxious and like to be prepared  down to the smallest detail  This subtype avoids expressing anger but can feel deeply frustrated when disrupted  ,infj
it s alright bud i also got mistyped as a  ,infj
I don t understand why so many people vote for him as INFJ  he should be a Te user  Compared to INTJ s Ray  his Te performance is more obvious  for example  he is weak but can achieve his goal by  using his body like a chess piece   And  prejudgment  probably has Ni s participation  TPN inside said  strategy  is Te Ni   Have excellent analytical ability and calm judgment ability  good strategy  Ready to die before being shipped  but never giving up on the plan  win  win  Even if you die  you can t fail  Although he was gone  he took care of his affairs and made a series of plans until he escaped  If I look at it  it s obviously Te Ni   Te and Fe are both outward judgment functions  Compared with interpersonal control of Fe  Te is the control of external environment and the desire to control real substances  It is a rational planning facing the objective reality  and has a high executive power  so it appears objective and rational  decisive  Fe should be in the back seat  It is  spring  for family members and  winter  for colleagues  It is not like Fe  Emotions gather more  like Fi  Fi is the Anima of ENTJ  and ENTJ can be tormented by inner morality  Fi   While Te suppresses impulsive behavior and isolates personal feelings and emotional responses  the process of performing for purpose may neglect one s own feelings  Even in four dimensions  he doesn t look like F  How little does he  prioritize projects over other people s feelings    Also a sign of Te   Enneagram  I think it is  W    In Personality Types Using the Enneagram for Self Discovery   it is stated that  Thinking is the basis of Type   people s world oriented Personality  so Type   Personality is corresponding to Jung s Introverted thinking type personality   I wonder if some people think his Ti is high  but I think his Fe is really nothing   In addition  the developed ENTJ  Ti will not be weak  Te is homologous with Ti  and can also carry a fifth Ti during development  Otherwise  there is no logic behind some rules and regulations  How can we have confidence in speaking out and controlling others  Some extreme control freaks are the Bad Te Dom of Ti  The official definition of  must think before act  is trait type    and the abdominal area is not considered to precede the brain area    is the most introverted type on Enneagram  which adds to his introversion  and lack of So   I think he s E  he s not pulling away from the object as much as Ray who s the real I   W  should be the wing type in his Tritype   Instinctual Stackings are Sx Sp  lacking So  Being focused on one to one  wanting to be with that person  being passionate  crazy about love  making what Ray sees as irrational decisions and helping Emma fulfill seemingly hopeless wishes is about love  Lack of a sense of community  trying to get out with someone you like in the first place without thinking about anyone else   Instinctual Stackings are about  survival in this world   what are the subconscious values   Self preservation Important  Sp   group survival Important  So       This survival instinct trumps the conscious and subconscious  Instinctual Stackings have considerable influence  and when there is a conflict between your personality and instinct tual Stackings values  the values of instinct tual Stackings will have priority    So many depictions of personality in reality become  inaccurate     Always think before you act  Norman himself wanted to act on emotion because he admired Emma     Also from official Settings  Norman has contradictions  He is a rational person himself  but he wants to act according to his emotions because he admires Emma  Ray could see that Emma was taking a risk  but Norman couldn t  Why would he risk it  No matter how psychologically complicated it is  there s no getting around it    he likes Emma  This is the personality and instinct tual Stackings values hedge  and the values of the personality will give way to the instinct tual Stackings preference   So has the value of  sacrifice himself to achieve the community   Norman prefers to  sacrifice himself to realize the dream of his beloved   It is also because he likes Emma that he dedicates to the group of edible children  At that time  He felt ashamed and longing for Emma  who cried because she was afraid of losing her family  So is his blind spot   Emma  who always cares about the group and everyone  is like So Sp  which is in line with the focus of So   to play and show herself in the community  group or work team   while Sx focuses on a certain person  he   showing her role positioning according to him around   The lack of Sx is due to the presence of Norman  who likes her so much  She seems to care about Him  but seems to be insensitive to love  unlike Norman  who told Ray that he  Because like    English is not good  the above rely on machine translation  Sorry  I may not be able to convey my ideas well and discuss them with you  ,infj
still learning about socionics  can someone explain why Norman is LII  I remember LII have Fi role  is that possible for an INFJs ,infj
te amo norman  INFJlover     ,infj
Norman  INTJ  Never  Te  Fi  Huh ,infj
Guys don t be so silly he s an obvious ESFP  Se dom all the way he is obviously athletic while climbing the wall  and it was him who suggested the idea  and feels things deeply in his own way  Te because he likes numbers and had the best scores on the test and he has a very dormant ni but I see why you might be confusing him  But I m opened to see other arguments   D,infj
 Copying from my comment below and editing as a thread  I do want to make this a good enough so  argument such that others can reference from           Quoting Naranjo s so  description    Here is what I call a  Prussian character   Social E  is cold  very formal  Kant  for example  was a great philosopher  He was Prussian  and Prussians had that character form that has a great love of precision and an intolerance for ambiguity  This is precisely the complete opposite of the six conservation  which is warm and feels too permissive for ambiguity  Among the Nazis there were many social six  Their behavior is very visible   this is the line  the party line  the line that defines which are the good guys and which are the bad guys     and what we need to do and we do it very efficiently   In efficiency  the social E  is similar to an E   Ichazo used the word duty  it is more than just being concerned with duty  since the social six are concerned above all with the reference point  They have the mind of a legislator  the categories clear  Their intellectual orientation is to know very well where the north is  where the south is  and the west  and the east  and     And if you ever wanted to become human  you would first need to go crazy and forget about all the points of reference  They need to forget duty   no duty   and connect with instinct and intuition  with life    so  is obviously the coldest of  s  compared to sp  s apparent warmth and sx  s passion in displaying strength   Naranjo  uncharacteristically  already had this subtype in mind and described it in detail far back when he wrote Character   Neurosis   Beyond these two varieties of paranoid style  which we might characterize with the traits of strength and weakness respectively  there is still another  corresponding to a third subtype according to instinct dominance  which we might call a  Prussian character  in reference to the stereotype of dutiful and authoritarian German rigidity  We do find its description in Millon s  companion volume  to the DSM III that I have often  It was Millon who coined the  avoidant personality  label in Disorders of Personality   quoted throughout this book there explained as a  paranoidcompulsive mixed personality     Despite their growing hostility and the repudiation of conformity and submissive respect as a way of life  they retain their basic rigidity and perfectionism  They are now all the more grim and humorless  tense  controlled and inflexible  smallminded  legalistic  and self righteous  These features of their makeup are even more deeply embedded and internalized as a fixed habit system  They may have found it necessary to discard their dependence on others as their primary source of reward  but the remnants of their lifelong habit of overcontrol and faultlessness are not as readily abandoned  Thus  they continue to seek the clarity of rules and regulations  cannot tolerate suspense  and impose order and system on their life  Deprived now of the guidelines of those others they have spumed  these paranoids lean increasingly upon themselves and become their own ruthless slave drivers in search for order and power    In view of the similarity between these ennea type VI individuals  who could well be loosely called  obsessive   with the obsessive personality proper  Le   ennea type I   Millon seeks to understand the difference between them and proposes that it lies in that these paranoid compulsives have renounced their dependency aspirations and have given up hope of achieving protection through the good offices of others  Whatever the truth of that  it cannot be questioned that the paranoid are more inner directed and introverted  Yet  they continue to seek the clarity of rules and regulations  cannot tolerate suspense and impose order and system in their life    Ah  how convenient  Naranjo even compared the  s and so   less debating work  In short  so s are more mistrusting with authority  independent  and purely focuses on the conscientiousness and order of their own life ,infj
 so seeks security from authority  They devote themselves to authority  Yes their main motivation is  duty  however the duty so   voters mentioned is taken very out of context  social   duty is to do what they are told from their authorities and obey them  This is the opposite of Norman  If Norman was a social   he wouldn t have planned an escape and obey Isabella or he would obey peter ratri and the demon supporting human authorities    The main fear of social   is being disapproved by or disappointing the authority they willingly obey to  They fear living without an authority that gives them rules about how they should live  They feel afraid and scared if they don t obey and give in total submission to authority   They don t question the truth  They believe in whoever acts like they know the truth the most   Instead of believing in the person who is right  they tend to believe in people who speak as if they were right  and who have the special gift of making themselves believed    Social  s tend to be shy and have little ability to socialize or to be moved or touched by something or someone which again is not Norman    Social  s are the perfect example for others   They want to be role models and teach others stuff the way they do it Norman and Emma teaching kids how to escape    Social  s tend to hide their anger until the very time to act on comes Norman keeping it cool until he takes charge and wants to declare war on demons   Social  s stick to their own way of doing things  because they believe their way is the only right and perfect way Norman not telling about his plan to emma and ray and doing things on his own all these years because he knows they wouldn t understand   Social  s as if they are implicitly saying   I m right and you re wrong   Norman never listening to others because he believes his way is the only way   Social Ones learn to repress emotions from a very early age  they were usually good kids who did not cause problems  They may have been young adults who acted  older  than they really were  who often forgot that they were children  Do I even need to say    In relationships  Social Ones can have high expectations  They tend to have more confidence in themselves than in others  They can seem remote at times  being self sufficient to the point of not seeming to need others  It can also prove difficult for partners and friends to convince Social Ones that a perspective other than their own can be correct  They are great reasoners and will argue their point energetically  They dominate through making the other person wrong  and it can be hard to convince them of the validity of a competing point of view  Again his entire mindset is this paragraph   So basically people who vote   for him either lack so much analysis skills that they just randomly analyze a character in their fantasy  don t know anything about enneagrams or just vote   for the sake of being the same type as him,infj
idk about   fix    is more prominant especially him being so focused on security he actually was so close to commit a genocide for the sake of it  his whole character was being a security pillar to humanity     securing the escape for emma    securing his community   he was never about knowledge in itself    or even morality of his actions      i can even argue that his attitude is of a social   instead of a  ,infj
Following up on what the user below said  I m having a hard time seeing LII  I don t really see Se PoLR in Itachi  Here s what I see  feel free to rebuttal this if it s inaccurate    I would say Ni base and Se suggestive would make more sense given his treatment of Sasuke  He himself was not overly ambitious or domineering  but he DID desire it out of others  He diverged a long term endpoint  Ni  and desired that others find the will to enforce it into fruition  Se suggestive   namely Sasuke    Personally I m thinking ILI  though depending on how you argue for it I m sure you could possibly type him IEI  I think Fe PoLR and Fi mobilizing make more sense given his high level of self containment and that he doesn t really desire an outlet by which he can be authentically raw in his emotional expression ,infj
Itachi s Fe  When his motives are revealed  we see that he did all that to preserve peace and harmony for the village  High complex Fe users xxfj  want to preserve peace and a stable social harmony harmony in some cases where the person can go out of his moral way to protect the social harmong of the bigger group  th function Fi ,infj
I see way more more fi than fe,infj
THE INTJ VOTES LMAO,infj
His opinions about reality is just too similar with opinions of Plato  Both of them are INFJs   Btw  what is the argument about LII ,infj
I see people are talking about the   in Itachi s tritype  and I agree that it is a rather odd pick  But I d also like to question his   since he strikes me more as a    Can someone point the   on him  He has so many votes at this point  that people probably take it for granted ,infj
I think Itachi is an unhealthy INFJ because he has the NI TI loop ,infj
How is he an INFJ can someone explain ,infj

i m on the fence between  w  and  w   since after rewatching seasons   and    specifically the episode  good damage    i ve started to see more of a case for  w   however    s disintegrate into type   s during stress  so it s pretty hard to tell   here s the argument i ve been feeling in favor for  w   despite diane s constant type   tendencies  i think her core motivations and fears are surrounded more around feeling inherently broken unlovable and needing to find some sort of personal significance meaning from her brokenness  her promising herself to write a memoir about her trauma   her character arc finishes at the end of the series when she finally allows herself to trust that somebody else could actually truly love her for who she is  flaws and all    an important moment for diane s character was going to cordovia and writing about something important  not just because it was a morally good use of her talent and time  but because it gave her a sense of personal meaning  when that experience didn t end up fulfilling that  she left and spiraled into nihilism    another interesting thing to look at is her friendship with bojack  this is      up for debate  but i feel like she wouldn t have been able to stay friends  not only that  but best friends  with him for so long if her core type was    he did too many morally awful things that she knew witnessed found out about  this includes the        way he talks to and treats other people on a normal basis  i think their friendship makes more sense in the context of a type    who couldn t let go of someone they felt was  just as screwed up as them  and would therefore feel less guilty less like a burden being around them rather than someone else    i do also think its interesting to think about how type   s are in the gut anger center  with the focus being on the suppression of anger because   s feel like its wrong to feel express anger and tend to be very self controlled  holding a tight rein on their emotions  on the other hand    s are known for being temperamental and often explosive with their emotions  they are also in the heart guilt center  dealing with the overindulgence of guilt     also  it s interesting to look at how   s disintegrate into   s and integrate into   s  while   s disintegrate into   s and integrate into   s  i never feel like diane integrated into a   ,infj
  Either you know what you want and then you don t get what you want  or you get what you want and then you don t know what you want    Every Happy Ending Has The Day After The Happy Ending    You are right  even when I was above ground I wasn t satisfied  oh my god  i am the problem     why can t i be happy  Am I boosted  I m a pit that good things fall into      I wake up in the morning and I feel like I have no purpose  and if I don t make some change in my life  then this is how I will feel forever     I am gross  i feel  all the time  like a garbage fire  and not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley  but a barge  floating out of sea  with no rudder  I am rudderless burning large garbage barge      I wasted so many years being miserable because i assumed that was the only way to be     That means that all the damage I got isn t  good damage  It s just damage  I have gotten nothing out of it and all those years I was miserable was for nothing  I could have been happy this whole time and written books about girl detectives and been cheerful and popular had good parents  is that what you re saying  What was it all for     Diane E   E    I m a firm believer of Diane being a   core  self preservation subtype  However  i do think she has a   and   fix  being her tritype       Some of the most present characteristics of her character are the constant feelings of dissatisfaction  focus on suffering and emotional complexity in an intellectual style  perfectly aligning with E s trait structure that I would like to expand on   E  trait structure   Envy  love hunger  guilty controlled greed  over desiring  self frustration  pursuit of the extraordinary and intense  dissatisfaction with the ordinary  extreme neediness but disliking neediness  Poor Self Image  feeling inadequate  prone to shame  sense of ridicule  feeling unintelligent ugly repulsive rotten poisonous  unfair self criticism  clingy  demanding  biting  dependent  over attached  Focus on Suffering  use pain as revenge  unconscious hope of obtaining love through suffering  sensitive  intense  passionate  romantic  suffer from loneliness  may feel their life is  tragic   deep longing  nostalgic  intimately forlorn  often languorous and pessimistic bitter  lamenting  complaining  despondent  self pitying  feeling of loss or fear of future loss  mourning  amplification of suffering  purposely make painful choices  victimization   Moving Toward   crave love  clinging to frustrating relationships to postpone separation  motivational inability to care properly for themselves    like  helplessness    Nurturance  thoughtful  understanding  apologetic  soft  gentle  cordial  self sacrificing  humble  obsequious   giving to get   empathic identification with the needs of others  possible masochistic exaggeration of nurture into self enslavement  Refinement  aversion to grossness  stylish  delicate  elegant  tasteful  arty  posturing  attempt to be different than they are  envy and imitation of originality  Artistic Interests  pain channeled into art and beauty  Strong Superego  seek to be better than they are  keenly aware of their standards  self discipline rule oriented  ego ideal is more aesthetic than ethical  tenacity  Other than E s trait structure being generally a perfect fit for Diane  we also have to mention E s ego fixations and defense mechanisms  that once again are extremely fitting for her    FOURS  Fixation | Melancholy | Continuously thinking about what is missing  accompanied by thoughts of being disconnected from others  The FOURS  Primary Defense Mechanism | Introjection Introjection is a counterintuitive defense mechanism  Instead of repelling critical information and negative experiences that can cause a person anxiety or pain  individuals introject the information   that is  they fully absorb  internalize  and incorporate these data into their sense of self  Fritz Perls  the father of Gestalt Therapy  refers to this phenomenon as swallowing something whole without being able to differentiate between information that is true from information that is untrue  Fours introject negative information   and repel positive data   about themselves as a way of coping with painful information and neutralizing external threats  They prefer to deal with self inflicted damage rather than having to respond to criticism or rejection from others    I ll debunk the   core typing in the next comments ,infj
I m honestly so confused  All i could think while watching the show is INFP  I didn t even wanna think about mbti while watching but it was so glaringly obvious  I dunno if i just forgot everything about mbti after moving out but here we are  I finished  binge watching the entire series for the first time so maybe a fresh perspective is good here    all of the questionable things she does when she prioritizes her own feeling can be traced back to classic fi looping   She has issues with seeing other peoples perspectives  All of the issues she s had with mr pb can be traced back to Fi  Healthy Fi can be mistaken for Fe which is seen in the later seasons more often  She prioritizes her values over other peoples feelings and comfort  a lot   Her problem solving also involves a bunch of FiTe in combination with Ne    she has the typical Fi dom problem of holding other people and ones self to such an unbelievably high standard that she ends up unhappy all the time    when she loops it never seems like a NiTi loop speaking of which all the things you could attribute to Ni for her suit FiNe much more  FiSi looping would make much more sense since her si forbids her to escape the hell of fi amd all the other issues the loop is known for   She does definetly have an intuiting function up there but it doesn t look like Ni and a dominant function is one you should be able to recognize easily in cartoons like these  Where even is the Ni grand vision  She doesn t seem overly concerned with future plans at all   fi has it s own logic just like ti and using facts to ground your emotional logic is usage of fite   she seeks her si with the people she knows which i admit could be seen as Fe    yes a lot of these things also have to do with the enneagram   but that doesn t take away from them being INFP related in the slightest    I also think its an interesting point that Bojack and Diane are mirrored so often in the show  They go through similar situations and have loads of highs n lows which brings up the ENTP INFP similarities that are often discussed on pdb  All while showing the extreme opposites these types really are  When they both get drunk and depressed their functions really feed into each other in the worst way  Their mutual Si making it even worse    I don t think saying  she s voted INFP because She s depressed  makes much sense since INFJ is understood as the most depressed type of all    Sorry for the horrible way in which this is written I m still p busy and have no wifi so this is from my phones notes  D    If you disagree plz explain what i might be misunderstanding but keep in mind that i won t be able to reply for some time   I d love to hear it tho,infj
her Se grip on season   was so relatable,infj
Is she  E though  Idk    She struggles to express herself and her opinions so much,infj
Can anybody explain her Fe to me please ,infj
why is she voted as so   ,infj

Oh thank god she s something other than  w  finally   Tho SO   and SX blind doesn t make sense for her if I m being honest ,infj

Typing Him is almost impossible  I will say though that He displays traits of both INFJ and INTJ    INFJ  Wants people to know Him  wanted to promote love and forgiveness  helped anybody He could throughout His entire ministry  very understanding of others and where they were at  wanted to get to know others before calling them to repentance  I also can t see Him as Fe blind tbh    INTJ  Super blunt  straight to the point and wasn t willing to over explain anything   he who has ears let him hear     laser focused on calling out and fixing sin  efficient   forceful when necessary  calling Pharisees snakes and flipping tables   Also don t think He s Te blind   That being said   it s possible I may be confusing stereotypical Te Fi behavior with Him being a staunch  w    a subtype that is notorious for being outspoken and blunt when needing to create a necessary revolution    I m really not sure  Need help   Edit  ok who is the loser downvoting all the INTJ comments  just because   At least explain yourself  Besides  I still voted INFJ anyway so you can chill ,infj

Unpopular opinion  Jesus is an INTJ I have read the Old Testament and the New Testament  Ni dom is obvious  But because most people thought of Thinkers as  brutal and chaotic   hardly anyone thought about whether Jesus was using Te  I think what he is doing is trying to make society more efficient and orderly for the future  like a Te aux  rather than wanting the best for everyone and maintaining order like Fe  For this  he also creates rules by using Te  But as I said  I think his efforts to reform society are Te rather than Fe  This is obvious  It s just that people think people who use Te are  feelingless           But Jesus is definitely an INTJ ,infj
Jesus was on an obvious Fi Te axis  Jesus was a very direct man  He always told things how it was  whether it d offened the other person or not  He was not making suggestions  He was making commands  His first line  in chronological order  was   Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand   A direct command to His people  He said He was not here to bring peace but to bring revolution  He said He was there to turn families against one another  To turn thing s on their head  There was no focus on Fe harmony   Yes  He said we are to love one another unconditionally but that s not Fe  He called pharisees snakes and told them that they served their father Satan  That s the kind of love He s talking about   Jesus was not well recieved  Many people hated Him  which is why they gathered and crucified Him for speaking the truth  It wasn t only the Romans but the Jewish people too  His own kind  He said   If the world hates you  remember it hated me first    He was not a kumbaya hippie  He was a righteous leader who flipped tables  caused uproar and called people out on their evil sinful ways ,infj
I remember hearing once that the real Jesus was an ENFP  not an INFJ  I m going to stick with that  I don t understand the stereotype about INFJs where they only speak abstractly  When I ve experienced this phenomena  it s been others attempting to gaslight me into thinking I m not speaking clearly when I am but I m just saying something they don t want to hear because it threatens their entire worldview ,infj
Why not ENFJ with developed Ti ,infj
I have posted in the past on Peterson being EIE  and this seems to be a typing that is widely agreed upon in SHS circles  although I now believe that his subtype is likely to be Normalizing Creative  He does not seem to be a leader or to have dominant aspects  and agreeableness is too low for an H aspect   NC over CN seems likely  a front of Normalizing  clean your room etc   but also a more chaotic creative aspect behind that  AO Shift to LII seems likely in his NT field  Also seems to have a pretty clear Ni accentuation  more emphasized than typical in EIEs ,infj
I believe Jordans image and commercial appeal is the visage of an INFJ  but his ability to ramble for extended periods of time without really saying anything could be a case for Ne,infj
His understanding of both Fe and Ti seem very Ni like  I can understand the ENTP votes but I simply just see him more as an INFJ ,infj
https   www youtube com watch v eMo   J J Y  i think that video is enough to ubderstand his type,infj
Difficult to type  but I m convinced he s and ENTP  There are similarities with INFJ  but he doesn t act like one  Interviews showed  a  Anxious Ni around future  he talked about regrets and not wasting time on stupid stuff in life and always move forward  b  he s an extravert  INFJs have limited capacity for interactions and active talking  c  talking style  typical ENTP hands down   the type of knowledge  back and forth discussions  deviating from the original topic  wide range of topics he knows well  while INFJ tend to narrow down a bit and be specific  master them  d  Fe in both types act completely different  in INFJ it manifests as an open concern for humanity   this vibe of peace   wanting to help  make a better world  warmth  ENTP s Fe is extraversion in general  wanting company to talk to  discuss stuff  bounce off ideas  e  ENTP males tend to be attracted to strong slightly on a masculine side females  this is due to being on a feminine side themselves  Petersons s wife is of that tough type and he says he likes that in her  My personal experiences with them prove the same  INFJ and ENTP are surprisingly similar  both want to help people  However  their approach is different  ENTP are solution oriented  they help by providing you technical knowledge perspective in non emotional manner  INFJs are more nurturing and spiritually inclined  offering support just being there and hearing you out  Same goal but different energies ,infj
He is not a XXTJ  no Te in this man  he is Ti rationalizing    From mbti notes tumblr com    I tend to view him sympathetically because his past work in psychology had the potential to be good  this was before becoming a very public figure   He used to write about the mind and meaning of life  Don t know what happened to him since then  Suffice it to say that  whatever the INFJ happens to believe  unhealthy Ni and Se imbalance leads one to confuse perception and reality  i e   a person takes their subjective perceptions impressions of the world as objective fact despite lack of empirical grounding verification  usually cherrypicking  evidence  to support whatever it is they want to believe or are predisposed to believing  completely unaware of how emotionally biased their thought processes really are    When the dominant function is not used properly  the judging functions cannot achieve any substantial development  which of course leads to poor judgment and misuse of Fe and Ti  A looping INFJ takes their subjective resentments grievances against people society and looks for confirming evidence to craft an  objective and impartial logical argument  that helps them justify holding what would widely be considered morally questionable beliefs  You can tell he s Ti and not Fi because he only pretends to stand firm when challenged  listen carefully and observe how he wriggles  deflects  condescends  and unintentionally gaslights by trying to convince you that you didn t hear what he clearly said  Ti loop can use  logic  to convince oneself of anything  which makes it easier to convince others without creating any cognitive dissonance  A Te type  however  knows full well they re lying  Fi authenticity  but doesn t care because they believe the end justifies the means  The Ni Ti loop thought process is designed to be exceptionally convoluted and contradictory such that nobody can penetrate it with facts and logic  they talk in long winded circles and once you are speechless from exhaustion  they can assume that they ve won   In the case of very unhealthy Fe Ti and Se grip  INFJs tend to feel a strong compulsion to remake the world to fit perfectly with their perceived reality  they seek to eliminate imperfections in the world so that they don t have to confront them within  This commonly manifests as extolling the truth to  help  all the ignorant and inferior people out there who  can t see the truth   that  conveniently  only the INFJ is  special  enough to access   If they achieve some validating agreement  it enables them to take their beliefs ever farther to extremes  They believe that they re doing something good for the world when they re really just busy with axe grinding  and people with a similar axe to grind will of course flock their way ,infj
I really don t see anything in him that would make him anything like a    In his speeches he s focused on being effective  what should you do to achieve this or that  Someone with   in his tritype would like    present these things and ideas from way more of an emotional way  he s way too practical  and he puts much more focus on the  how to achieve this and that feeling  rather than talking exactly about the feeling ,infj
https   youtu be t ym XQZ Hw       onwards  isn t he essentially discussing the underlying theories of MBTI functions but in a more generalised  Big    type of way  I wonder why he doesn t acknowledge MBTI as a valid tool for personality assessment  rather he s just criticised its psychometric utility and dismissed it as a whole ,infj
My experience as a    yo male INFJ  w    my Fe is        up by having to deal with a narcissist during my teen years  I get stuck way too much in Ni Ti loop  and I rely way too much on my inferior Se  Having nearly zero self confidence when you are simultaneously trying to balance the whole world AND trying to fit your individuality into it feels like mission impossible  Life s a       and I m doing my best everyday to get a healthier relationship with myself and my ego   also trying to distance myself from MBTI but this      is addicting and can t help myself from trying to type every person ever  ,infj
Alright  I m not like trying to start      here or anything  but i genuinely want some people to give me arguments as to why INFJ is more EII than IEI  I have some bias because I m an IEI  afaik  INFJ  but whenever I read socionics descriptions I tend to think IEI sounds more like INFJ whereas EII sounds more INFP  And it also just makes more logical sense to me seeing as though its mostly agreed upon than INTP correlates more to LII and INTJ to ILI to INTJ  that the similar situation would be true of INFx types  Also just feels off to me that the majority of INFJs would be Fe ignoring and Si hidden agenda in socionics  whereas INFPs would be Ti hidden agenda  Like I know the functions are defined differently in the systems but still that seems off ,infj
Hey that s my MBTI  Even though come across as extroverted because of my enneagram which is a Type    Just like helping others y know  ,infj
It s pretty interesting to see the different flavors of INFJs here   ,infj
This is merely from my own experience with my friends and myself  Also from what I have read and taken from it  It s probs not the best said  And just ignoring function blocks for this so yeah not the best per se   I think   s rely on the comfort of their environment or else they cannot look into themselves safely   They are group orientated and look to include themselves with others   And I think this reads more INFP   Whereas   s rely on the security of their mind or else they cannot apply themselves into the environment around them   They are self orientated and look to isolate themselves from others   And this more INFJ   Problem is that I think it still works the other way around but I think what I had stated is the most dominate   While my enneagram is   with a   wing  sp so  I still have a lot and I mean a lot of relations with    social  but hardly any   and some   but not enough   Triad is       w    w   and  w    I can easily pass as a  w  so sp  In fact I mean I really fluctuate between both but I think my core self is  w  sp so   I most definitely used to be  w  at some point but a verrrrrry unhealthy one      Dec   th oop nvm I m  w  sp so but I still have  w  in my triad lol  I still stand by this tho      So in conclusion I think the wing type comes heavily into play when determining is an INFJ  or even INFP  is a   or   ,infj
INFJ can easily to be a type    There are a lot missinterpretation about type   descriptions      s have to have a feeling of connectedness to their body  They must reference their body for all wisdom and decisions  The mind is seen as a tool to entertain and comfort the body    This is a missinterpretation  type nine can be both connected to their body and disconnected from their body   Type  s are not related to Se function  In truth  Type    especially  w   is the less initiative and action oriented among all enneagram types  Because their actions can create conflict  Conflict can break their inner peace    The mind is seen as a tool to entertain and comfort the body   Absolutely wrong  This description could fit only with self preservation    but it s still too stereotyped   Not all types nine act like that  Others  s enjoy to live in their mind to avoid the concrete problems   Body comfort isn t relate to any function  but is relate to self preservation instinct   Why is type   belonging to the  body triad  Type   are a  body type  just because  s are related to Rage and the want to be in control of their own life  When they express their anger  they do it through their body   Type      and   belong to the  Being group   They needs to control their life  That s why the descriptions said that Type   is a body type because he needs control  It s not related to Se  it s more related to self preservation instinct   Some  s control their live through routines  other  s control their live  avoiding the reality and living in their head    Type   and   need to express their emotions  while   want repress it  because they feel too shame    and   blocked their shame  Type   avoid his shame  Type   and type   prevent and blocked their fear  Type   can t  so he tries to avoid it  Type   and   express their anger  But   repress it     Type  s are in the anger body triad  but they still reclutant to express themselves  through their actions   They prefer to be passive    Type  s are in the fear thinkers triad  but they avoid their anxious thoughts  because they don t want feed their fear     Type  s are in the shame feeling triad but they avoid their shame feelings  Because shame are too painful for them  Do you understand now ,infj
We ve actually reached the point where people think INFJ is   like and Fi dom is   like   Help me Jesus                             INFJ   is rare and Fi dom   is also rare  They exist but most Fi dom    s   are  s or  s  The nature of   is more INFJ like than IxFP like  and the nature of   is more IxFP like than INFJ like       and    are purely self focused at their worst  all they care about is  MY comfort  and  MY safety     is a mixture of self focused and other focused even at their worst  bc  s are an Image type meaning they re constantly paying attention to the external emotional world  Fe  and using it to inform their identity and mood  even if they re ashamed to admit this   I and a few others I ve spoken to have been questioning if INFJ   is even real because of inferior Se meaning INFJs should be detached from their bodies    is the most body focused type in the enneagram  Most INFJ  s would therefore be mistyped INFP   ISFx  or INFJ  s   s   s or sp s  Can any INFJ  s explain how they experience a body fixation whilst still being inferior Se  ,infj

pretty obvious imo  also   not open to criticism  ,infj

I don t really remember instances of his inf se honestly  but there was an instance of inf ti in the rebuild when he realised that things aren t going as planned then again  things like that could happen to INFJs too Not to mention that he s shown more signs of ni than fe in the way he speaks,infj
i love  s so much  hands down my favourite enneatype  they are just very fascinating to me on a psychological level  i m referring more to the rebuild version of kaworu here   if you re interested in his character i would recommend reading the evangelion battlefields scenario translations  he is in seasons   and    https   docs google com spreadsheets d  Ag ZyoF   usbsIJx   aMbJS NHjhYwZCz LPso jQ edit gid  ,infj
PDB is SOOOO close to typing a Social Two properly but just barely misses the mark  Here are the described traits of the Sexual    SX     Aggressive  hypersensitive   idolater of desire   impulsive and limitless  dependent   histrionic  rebellious and transgressor  hedonistic  idealized self image  inconsistent  universal giver  anti intellectual  competitive  unconventional         movements  seemingly loose hips  affectivity disconnected from sexuality  difficulty in delivery  happy  big spender  fear of failure  Kaworu is not as aggressive as the Sexual Two nor is he as outwardly emotional  He much better fits the colder and more domestic Social Two combo  He is much more fixated on using seductive abilities for a socially complex gain  Much more ambitious and  intellectual  than the very aggressive and abrasive Sexual Two  I think Kaworu is an ENFJ but I find it silly that PDB types him an INFJ yet also types him the most assertive and aggressive subtype of    Think of SX s as the over passionate and sometimes hysterical lover and the SO  as the cold but passionate and ambitious seducer of audiences  Now think to yourself which one he fits ,infj

In my opinion  he is an   So  not a Sx  This whole thing of sacrificing himself for humanity in NGE was very   social  Everything Kaworu does he does thinking about humanity   Or the lilins  he does love Shinji  but he doesn t do everything thinking about him  I think people are confusing the fact that he s in love with Shinji with Sx instinct      In NGE he sacrificed himself for humanity saying he didn t want to go back to adam  or go to lilith  because he had empathy for humans and thought they had to live and the same thought is repeated in rebuilds  and if you believe in the loop theory  the Rebuild s kaworu is the same as the anime      The same thing happens in rebuilds  kaworu is tired of Selee  tired of gendo  he doesn t want mass extinctions to keep happening  he doesn t want the impact  so it stopped the impact at      so he sacrificed himself again at      to save shinji  to save the humans because he has empathy for them    SoSx spreads its wings to dispense in a landless sky  focusing on the social  creating bonds as if it creates sparks  I don t think Kaworu is SxSo because SxSo is someone more focused on the dynamics of transformation and destruction  it is as if the social dynamics were a park where the individual can exhale his sexuality  and without caring about the impact of his actions  and this is not what happens with Kaworu  SoSx  on the other hand  is more aware of the impressions they make on others  is someone who takes the social considerably more seriously than SxSo with an emphasis despite a secondary series on the disgust   fusion attractions  The phrases that Kaworu speaks in NGE about humans and love reminds me a lot about this Social focus  The focus he has on lilins  So  and human connection  Sx  makes me wonder that   The Social Two is a seducer of environments   a more adult  leader type  In contrast to the other Two subtypes  the Social Two appears as a powerful or intellectual person   and i repeat  I feel that many people here are ignoring the focus he has on social and human issues in both NGE and      and focusing solely on his romantic love for Shinji   I think Kaworu is very focused on social issues and humanity itself  mainly in NGE    to be honest  he is basically a Howl Pendragon with w  and Se inferior     Based on that  I believe that Kaworu fits more in SoSx ,infj
he has the same mbti and enneagram as me lol,infj
                   ,infj
WTFFFFFFFFF HE S A SX XDDDDD  In evangelion  at times kaworu felted like his only porpoise was to meet shinji  One of his main priorities WAS SHINJI  The social subtype of the enneatype   is gonna center his seductive behavior to a group of people  this sort of seductive way that kaworu acts Is a way more personal one   Maybe I was born to meet you ,infj
Apparently Jung himself said he has dominant thinking and has been a thinker since a young age  with secondary intuition  and with trouble in the areas of feeling and sensing  An INFJ would not have such developed Ti with such underdeveloped Fe  and an INTJ would not write a book in such a clearly Ti Ne manner  as well as both not processing the function order Jung describes himself with  I ve been reading Psychological Types and instead of presenting facts succinctly and clearly as a high Te user or even high Fe or Ni user would likely do  he circles around his ideas and reiterates them  displaying his high Ti and Ne  He also seems to display bias in favor of Ti users  as well as toward introversion in general ,infj
We ve really bastardised Jung s theories  haven t we ,infj
His theory is highly based on mysterious experiences and Jung himself is quite attracted to such Mysticism  The whole archetype theory sounds both Cosmicism and Determinism to me  This is a very good example of using Ni as a dominant function  His Ti is well developed and works in an assisting role when he is polishing his theories ,infj
Jung himself said he was characterised by thinking  had a great deal of intuition  had difficulty with feeling  and he was often at variance to the reality of things  He then says  That gives you all the necessary data for a good diagnosis  for his psychological type    The problem with INFJ is that he states that he is characterised by thinking  Not tertiary thinking  Jung came up with the majority of the theory of functions  and he knows his own psyche better than anyone else  I trust him more than someone on this website  People who say Jung is misinformed about himself or functions are much more likely to be the misinformed ones than the guy who came up with the theory of functions and is typing himself  Jung also states he uses a great deal of intuition  which makes him either an INTP or an ENTJ if he were to be a thinking dominant  but he also says he was often at variance to the reality of things  which means ENTJ  with Se tertiary  is very unlikely  Therefore INTP  I understand where the INFJ is coming from  people think he had bad Fe for an INFJ but used a lot of Ni   Ti  which is possible however him stating he was  characterised by thinking  and that he  always thought  from early childhood on  makes me think this is unlikely with INFJ having tertiary Ti   Where he says all this stuff ,infj
The two types that generally seems to be suggested is INTP and INFJ  therefore I will only be discussing the potential application of Jungian cognitive functions in relation to these two types and their function stacks  Jung characterized himself as a thinker  Ti  and as an intuitive second  Ni ne   meaning that his Ti was likely more well develop than his Ni or Ne  although this does not necessarily exclude him from being an INFJ  He also stated that his  relation with reality was not particularly brilliant   which seems to imply inferior Se  which all suggest that he could be an INFJ  However  he also claims that he had trouble with feeling  and Fe being auxiliary function  it is difficult to reconcile with the theory of him being an INFJ  even if his tertiary function was hypothetically more well developed  It does however match the function stack of an INTP  as there comparatively are no exact contradictions  at least according to his own account  Source ,infj
NFJ typed characters are the most confusing characters on this website    A mature ENxP characters have traits of what some people on this website say the  Ni  thinking deeply and subjectively  but the answer is also objectively correct  and  Fe  Get along well with others while still exposing their own characteristics  are not really Ni and Fe neither by the MBTI or the Jungian theories   That s just mature personality   If you really want a deep answer  that kind of Fe N characters retaining their N personality but being social  is actually how Jung described  Se    Also for the Ni   When a N or an IN character is very subjective N  while their answer is not just an useless imagination  but an objective truth  people on this website seem to  See Ni  from them  but that is not Ni dominant is supposed to mean   In Jung s view  that is a mature Introversion that has acknowledge the importance of Extraversion    Then how do we distinguish a born ENFJ and a born ENxP characters who are mature enough to look like  Ni and Fe according to PBD people    Just look at their  four letters   Do not over indulge in   functional theories that are either not used by MBTI branches and which does not even correspond with Jung s ideas   Then you will realize that there were tons of mature ENx P  characters that are E NFJ ed and tons of INx P  characters that are I NFJ ed on this website   When I bring four letters typing  some people on this website tackle me that I am too into dichotomy  But thinking dichotomy the best and knowing the meaning of dichotomy are different  I know Jungian typing and MBTI typing  but I know the meaning of MBTI as a dichotomy   A NP type is a NP because N and P are their lifelong tendency  and their matured traits what people call Ni or Fe  is another conversation   For example  you do not even need to see Ni or Fe from Tanjiro Kimetsu  or Judy Zootopia    You can just see Extraverted  iNtuitive  Feeling  Judging tendency from them  But from a mature character who has P tendency  you will have to find their traits that makes you  see Ni and Fe  from them   Also the actual Ne tendency is not a function that makes someone imagine in a scattered way or think of just creative ideas that has no objective meaning in the objective world   When N and P are mixed  it means their tendency to  feel  from subjective unreal  foreseeing  intuitive  unconscious  things   So S P people  feel and realize  a lot from beautiful landscape  real situation  sensual facts  while N P people  feel and realize  from meanings  symbolism  behind meanings  and ideas as if those are really in front of them  When the N is introverted so it is  Jung s Introverted iNtuition   they tend to feel from psychological  mentally things  This is not MBTI s Ni  but IN types   When the N is extraverted so it is  Jung s Extraverted iNtutition   they tend to feel and foresee from external things  This is not MBTI s Ne  but EN types   I will cut from here  for more information please click my profile   Thank you ,infj
 A conception can never be comprehensive  for it is always depending on the point of view adopted  the point of view chosen for this work is psychology  Of course  this point of view is not the only one possible  but there may be another one  or even others ways to consider  So  more in the spirit of psychology Freudian  this treatise on child psychology could be considered from the purely hedonistic point of view  in this case  the psychic process would be seen as a movement determined by the pleasure principle  The reasons would then be the desire and pursuit of that fantasy performance that provide the greatest pleasure and satisfaction possible  Or on the other hand  according to Adler s proposal  the same material could be seen in the light of principle of power  which would be as valid a way in psychology as the principle of pleasure  It would still be possible to adopt the strictly logic to consider  in order to monitor the development of the process logical in the child  And it would even be possible to adopt the point of view of psychology of religion  in order to highlight the beginnings in the formation of God concept  I contented myself with keeping an intermediate position  that kept the line of simple psychological consideration of things  without try to accommodate the material to this or that fundamental principle  hypothetical only  With that  of course  I do not intend to challenge the possibility of these principles  as they are all included in nature  human  only a partial expert could declare how universally valid some heuristic principle  which was of special value for your discipline or your personal way of looking at things  Precisely because there are several possible principles  it is essential in human psychology never try to conceive of things in light of a single of these principles  but rather try to consider them under different aspects  The conception adopted in this book is based on the assumption that the sexual interest plays a causal role in the process of formation of the childish thought  which in no way can be neglected  This one assumption  certainly  it should meet no more serious opposition  The opposite position would certainly already have a very large number of well observed facts  even without taking into account that it would be extremely unlikely that an instinct  so important in human psychology  does not start to manifest itself in the child soul  yet that in a rudimentary way    I used google translate to translate it  that s why it might look weird af  ,infj
From what I ve read from him so far  strikes as a  Ne ti  like a bird circling around a tree and spiraling down  He repeats the same concept of the   sides of the mind in different ways  Constantly emphasizes the effects of primitive man and how their conscious is stuck which effects their thinking  choices and social ethics  Dreams and symbols  looking deeper than just an obvious sign  what is it s meaning   are one of the best way to express to yourself and only you can interpret what they mean  Could be wrong  would say he is more of I TP  INTP or ISTP   leaning towards INTP ,infj
Jung  the origin of MBTI  typed himself INTP according to HIS theory  and here we are questioning that    I mean  it s always smart to question things  even  God  himself  But what does this debate about MBTI tell us  That we shouldn t follow it religiously  He identified as BOTH INTP AND ISTP  Just proves my  theory  that not everyone will fit into one type  He himself knew about the rigidity of this theory and is probably laughing at us from up there  ,infj
I am INTP and I scored highest in Ni  so Jung is an INTP with high Ni since he is  w   Source  bro  trust me ,infj

I m a literature major lmao,infj
books     if it s somethjgn i m rly into then i will literally  read it   if i have the time  in     sittings  ,infj
books are amazing  That s all I need to say  I don t kin Twilight Sparkle for nothing ,infj
I don t know  But I ve read research on MBTI linked with average reading of books per year  though I haven t verified the source   and it concluded it was INFP  As an INFJ  w       I absolutely adore books  nevertheless ,infj
It depends on the literary genre and the subject it addresses  your desire to read the book  the variety of characters and complexity of the action  etc   etc  But yes  reading is quite enjoyable generally    ,infj
i like books,infj
the Ni  Dom  Ne  Aux  Si  Tert  Se  Inf  is hillarious,infj

Books the ultimate source of knowledge  The tool of improving your concentration and your senses  I love em ,infj
In my opinion deku has more   than   because yes  in the two enneagrams the person wants to help others but this desire is more focused on pride and ego for enneagram two and on the public image that reflects  We see multiple times how deku puts the needs of others ahead of his own and tries to help others but from the point of view that he does not really care about the image that he gives or that others love him back like a   would do  I really risk a lot with this example but let s take All Might  an enneagram    He always strives not only to save and help people but also to reflect an image of optimism and security to others  instead  in multiple scenes All Might had to remind deku of the image since he was more focused on saving that he completely forgot to project  I hope you have understood me and if someone does not agree I would love to know your opinion  who knows  maybe I will notice things that I miss  I m just learning ,infj
I thought his fi was so clear  The entire show his actions were guided by his own ideals  values  and hopes   That s right  Don t worry about what other people think  Hold your head up high and plunge forward   Even though he had no quirk and was constantly being told by other people to give up he didn t and followed his own dreams  He also says that it s easier for him to gather his thoughts out loud  ne   which goes against Ni usage because Ni users often struggle to express their thoughts before giving them enough thought ,infj
I ll be honest when I first posted my comment   months ago I had only seen season   so I thought it best not to push too much and dial it back with the general consensus  But now that i ve finished S   i gotta say i m even more convinced  Take S  E   for example  the major plot point was basically Deku trying to overcome his  SJ stereotypes   At the beginning of their training All Might advises Deku not to imitate him and to try something new and unique but like a true anime protagonist Deku somehow doesn t understand simple sentences so it lingers on his mind as he tries to  decipher  what All Might meant  Later on he goes to see the pro hero  Power Loader who tells him about Hatsume s    well  use of Ne pretty much and encourages them to treasure their relationship with her because she is an innovator not bound to existing ideas  aka typology translation   Deku try to work on your intuition  develop your inferior Ne to a point where you don t overthink about it as much anymore once you overcome certain hurdles in life   and then we get the glass shattering metaphor scene   In my opinion  an INFJ wouldn t need much mentorship to understand this concept since they already share a similar function with ENxPs  and are naturally attuned to this behavior most especially in their teen years before life has had the chance to drag them back to reality  At the end of the day  this is still a fictional character and maybe his personality type changes in future episodes but as of the end S  which is currently where I m at  ISFJ seems most likely  See y all again in S   hype   Also this       Thanks Frank ,infj
Just my two cents on his tritype  and I m open to criticism     I don t see Izuku s helping of others as ego focused very much at all  as the   wants to be seen as a helpful  kind person primarily because of that image focus on wanting it to be reciprocated even when he s unhealthy  it s him ignoring his own needs and desires as the   does  instead of trying fulfill some internal ego desire    s vice is  pride   as in  look what I ve done for you  I m such a good person   A great example of this pride is in Xie Lian from Heaven Official s Blessing in his youth  in particular           Nor is he as superego driven naturally as an individual   and   s attachment fixes and fear of separation  imo  fit him better  since double attachment is more apparent in him than anything considering his relationships with All Might and Bakugo  and his tendencies towards self effacement and being a pushover note that those self erasing tendencies is something he has to  grow out of   and the critical nature appears following that    Nines adapt  or accommodate  their own wants and opinions to be consistent with those of others  Nines want peace  so why rock the boat  By going along with others  they can attain the harmony they seek  Nines base their sense of self on their attachment to their idealized  internalized harmonious  view of the world      Nines are uncomfortable expressing their own wants and would keep quiet that risk a conflict  Informing others of their wants or opinions sometimes feels like aggression that may threaten the relationship  It s best not to make a scene  to say yes when they mean no  and not question the status quo  Nines accommodate to avoid conflict  Unfortunately  this behaviour makes Nines easy targets to be taken advantage of by others     Average Nines live vicariously through others  often identifying with a stronger more assertive more passionate person  They idealize the other and or the union             Triple compliant feels a bit weird considering how much of a rule breaker he is too haha  compare to how stringent Momo is towards things  again  and double positive outlook makes more sense  especially given his childhood and how he basically walked out of it almost unaware of the psychological impact it had on him but he maintained his  positive outlook  as the name suggests      People whose dominant Harmonic approach is the Positive Outlook approach are generally optimistic and tend to avoid negative thoughts or situations  Under stress  they seek to avoid the problem  distract themselves with something else  or minimize the problem  These types want to feel good and want others around them feel good  They would rather have everyone happy  including themselves  than to deal with problems or negativity  especially in themselves   Unfortunately this approach can lead them to deny the existence of their problems and therefore delay addressing them   These types also have issues with finding a balance between meeting their own needs and meeting the needs of others     This archetype s drive is to maintain a sense of calm and connectedness through merging with the outside and diminished awareness of the inside             I feel that someone with a   fix would be a lot more frustrated with the system and his negative experiences too  like Todoroki  and probably have a critical and reform ish mindset from the get go  but Deku has to be forced into thinking along those lines with a ton of negative things happening to the world in general later    Ones want autonomy  so they try to earn it according to the rules  If they do their work better than anyone else  no one will interfere with them   Under stress  Ones escalate their principles into perfectionism or workaholism  If they are perfect  no one has the can criticize them  Ones believe they are morally superior to others     Ones can get into conflicts by being too impatient  rigid  and critical  Ones focus on solving problems by doing what s right  Ones strongly believe that by following the rules  their faith  or their principles they will come to a just and fair solution  Ones feel that they must put their own wants  and feelings  aside in order to remain objective  and autonomous from influence   Ones may appear cold to others and that they don t take into account the feelings of others      I can even see this tendency to want to bend the environment and people around them in favor of something like this  albeit more considerately since she s a Fe user  in Momo more than Izuku       Basically  super low image fix his urges to save aren t from wanting to be seen as a lovable  helpful person    ego driven   and he has a terrible self awareness and tends to parrot what he picks up from his environment  like not coming up with what he wants to do as a hero until questioned by Mirio  I feel that in part should point towards   and     ,infj
Is it save to say that he is so sx if you re using just subtypes without enneagram and so sp if you are using it with enneagram ,infj
His two fix is too obvious to not be his second fix imo  Warm  sincere  makes it his mission to befriend and save e v e r y o n e  I even questioned he could be core   but so   fits him too well  The man is honestly a walking   with a   fix ,infj
He s an IEI  The EII typing is beyond ridiculous considering how drawn he is to Se   Omg he s sweet shy and introverted his Se must be weak and he s therefore an EII           take ,infj
Argument for his enneacore and tritype   I think  w  makes a lot more sense than  w   I know how passive and friendly he is especially since he s been bullied for years by Kacchan  but it s actually not because he really has a hard time being firm and venting his anger  He could actually be assertive and let out a temper if he wanted to  but he just didn t feel like he really had to prioritize that in this case  To me  he s a healthy   so he can look a lot like a   in terms of behavior    integrations to   if they re healthy  since he has problems with anxiety  He basically doesn t care if he gets bullied because he has more important goals and dreams to take care of  In fact  I even view his loyalty and friendliness to Bakugo more as one of his healthy   trait  He views Bakugo as his inspiration material  although Bakugo is character who has done bad to him  but he seems to be able to sort out the advantages that lie it in  He admits that he has always been fascinated by his firmness and determination  which he considers to be an imitation worthy of emulation  Surprisingly  this is one of Deku s actual weaknesses  I feel he is too clingy with the people he loves and sometimes even tries to imitate what they do  It s like he draws near to people for protection and security  Not to mention  he s in compliant   reactive is more suitable than withdrawn   positive outlook triad  Compliant triad are often recognized for the service of others  They seek the greater good  they like to follow rules and live according to social norms  does this sound like Deku to you guys  Also  Compliant are dutiful in their own ways but they all move toward people in hopes of earning what they desire  He often moves toward the author he idealized  All Might  to fulfill his dream of becoming a hero  He may not be as unhealthy as the other reactive cores  but he s still at the reactive core  He s very vulnerable to the point where hypersensitivity is his character s weapon  This is precisly because of how he was treated by Bakugo for    consecutive years  this is where the water fountain crying trait gives rise to him which I find painfully hilarious  I think his description tells how emotionally unstable he is   frequently overreacting to abnormal situations with exaggerated expressions  he is initially portrayed as insecure  tearful  vulnerable  and non expressive   Apart from that  he s also pretty obvious in the head triad  He always wastes his time thinking and planning things in his head so this causes his habit of overthinking  He uses his knowledge independently  w   to provide protection in his life    cores   He also has  fear  as his dominant feeling  perhaps he has a kind of phobia with Kacchan which is the reason why he can t stand up for himself  He s a pretty self explanatory  w   at least less cold than how most people protayed a  w     For his tritype      as he s pretty much the definition of compliant  One have high standards and tend to see things in black and white  right and wrong  They work hard to be right all the time  They are idealistic and will put forth great effort to improve the world around them  which often puts them in a role of reformer  I think this makes a lot of sense considering that Deku is an idealist who works hard all the time for his moral and ethical code  It s weird if he doesn t have at least one frustrated fix in his tritype  He can very  very much pour out his anger if he is at war with a villain trying to carry out his responsibilities  Judging from his motivation  he tends to be more afraid of being corrupt evil than try to avoid any possible conflicts  Like I said  the reason why he looks like a   is because he s a healthy    What makes him possibly a           is that he doesn t appear as critical and judgmental with as someone who has their   fix higher  Having a higher   in tritype will make people warm  sincere and people oriented but sentimental and acknowledging their own needs at the same time  Deku always has a problem taking care of his own needs  he doesn t even care breaking his bone structure when it comes to helping people  He s eager to get involved in other people s lives  He s rarely say no when others ask for their help  and want to prove value to others by always being there for them  The reason why Deku doesn t resent Bakugo isn t because he s passive  but because he s just generous  He s okay if he gets bullied  but his loyalty and sense of mutual cooperation have no limits so he always feels like it is his duty to help people who are in danger and Bakugo is no exception  This kind of hero is what he has idealized and applied in his life journey to achieve his dream  But obviously my argument is quite flawed and I will graciously accept your corrections   ,infj
His  w  personality stuck out to as the first personality traits he was showing in the series  his loyal nature clear for   and his desire for knowledge his    His enneagram   including his tri type   fits perfectly with the start of the series  but it also blends in with all the other personality traits we can see dominate as the series goes on  such as his ni  Se inferior is very obvious as he has to work hard to master him being present in the moment  and he is still improving on it  This is displayed as a fact in the MHA stats book where it says his presence as a hero is very weak compared to his other skills  One of the moments his ni stood out to me was when he was having dinner in the Todoroki household and he could see behind what was presented in the situation  He is a natural mediator but also very emotional and value based so I had to go with phlegmatic melancholic ,infj
I ve commented here before expression confusion about his enneagram  but I definitely see his   fix and   fix now  The social types for both of these fit him well  Although I m curious about why         To put it simply I think he fears being corrupt and wants to have integrity more than he fears conflict and desires peace ,infj

Why INFJ and not ENFJ lol  his motivation and the main reason why he wants to become a hero  helping people and for the sake of others  he can literally break himself And I do not think that Ni is his dominant function  it is auxiliary  he writes down all the information about the heroes in order to use them only in order to become a hero like them  his main motivation is to help people Se is not his last one either  it is perfect for Ni  He notices the world and the movement of people  sees their needs  and uses Ni to understand this information and use it to help people  Fe   He immediately realized that Uraraka was in pain even when she said that everything was fine with her  I don t think Se inf  Would have picked it up   Ti inf    I don t understand how you guys couldn t see it     Okay  so  the ideal example of Ti inf is the moment when it was necessary to save Bakugou  Although it was a stressful moment  he began to come up with a plan by analyzing everything  He realized that if he had extended a helping hand  Bakugou would not have accepted it  so he asked Kirishima  Ti   manifested itself in him only in the most stressful situations ,infj
Can someone explain to me why he is a Ni dom   Why can t he be ISFJ ,infj
He plans everything in advance  no way he s a perceiver,infj
An argument for INFP voters  How is Deku an FI dom  Deku constantly stores information to use later on  Ni  and doesn t give subjective meaning to certain things  I would like more proof on the Ne aux  Si tert  and Te inferior,infj
why  w   I didn t get to think about his enneagram  so i m not disagreeing  i just want to know the reason,infj
Why INFJ this anoying character he have no consident to be INFJ  If he INFJ maybe unhealthy INFJ  ,infj
He has a tendency to go in a Ni Ti loop   But when the chips are down  he ll go for the most ethical decision ,infj

I saw someone in those internet typing pictures that shows you in  images  typing Midoriya as ESTP      I m sure they though   E   He s loud and talks to others  introverts are literal mute rocks S   He jumps into battle and shows phsycis  N barely walk  he s kind of dumb too bc he breaks his bones    T   Though he sometimes kind of dumb  he smort   P   bc chaos with his OFA XoX,infj
Why phlegmatic over sanguine as main type  I think he is way more sanguine than that  He is shy too  but I think the traits he displays aren t enough to say he is  What is your opinion ,infj
Most of the  hero vision  that Midoriya has comes from the actions and visions of other characters  He does not internally filter his opinions nor does he create his own interpretation of facts and the artistic meaning of events  much less attribute it to something interpersonal about him  He wants to be a hero because being a hero is about saving lives and being like Allmight  Thats it   Distinguishing Fi from Fe is very complicated but one of the ways I found to differentiate it is to see exactly how the sentimental filtering process happens  it s kinda hard because everyone has their own opinion of things regardless of whether they are Fi or Fe  but the way that these opinions are formulated and created is the key to understand   Bakugou even though he doesn t have a developed  and much less healthy  Fi has clearly created for himself an foreign and different interpretation of Allmight s speech  which connects and talks much more with his inner feelings than Midoriya s interpretation does   And the coolest thing about that is that they are both complex characters  And BOTH has morals     please forgive me my bad english  im trying my best to write this    ,infj
  Fe vs Fi   Fe  The own values and etic come from the others  Fe users have a tendency to understand and prioritize the feelings of others  Fe is about the understanding of the other people    Fi  The own values and etic come from the inside and they are very personal  Fi users are tuned with their own feelings  Fe  https   youtu be vH XHC Ddmw Fe quote   So then  it s up to you  Kirishima  It s no good if I do it  Or Todoroki  or Lida  or Yaoyorozu   Ever since school started  you build an equal relationship with Kacchan   If you  his friend called him   Then I m sure   Deku planned the Bakugo s rescue using Ni Fe Ti   Deku has Fe because his values come from external   From All Might  for example  Deku wanted to be like him  At the start he imitated All Might  Deku s suit reminds of All Might  the smile  the antennas  the signature move  SMASH   he copied them all from All Might   A Fi dom prefers to follow his internal values and be authentic      Ti VS Te   Ti  Ti users question everything  They judge with their Ti function  even their own logic Ti users want that everything have a logic  They don t trust in outside sources without question about them  Ti users tend to make up their own theories and opinions    Te  Te users believe in facts  data  and information they gather from outside sources  They don t stop and internally process if the information seems reasonable inside their heads   Ti   Ti quotes       But  well  I don t really understand what you mean by inheriting or passing on a quirk   l ve never heard of anything like that before  and it s never even been conjectured in the debate  Why is that  Is because since the dawn of history  a Quirk like that was never confirmed        But Shiozaki is a strong opponent whoplaced fourth in the entrance exam  Kaminari s Quirk is supposed to be strong  Vines huh  I wonder if it s like Kamui Woods s Quirk  It d be impossible to get close while avoiding all those vines  Blinding types really are strong  I hardly ever see anyone break out  So you d either have to tear them off or get through with brute force                about    days of real training even if i m efficient   I can get in about   h of training mourning and night   so that s     hours   bodybuilding to create a body able to adapt to any situation   If I don t work out my whole body equally  then there s no way I ll make it    Ti function is about being analytical  is about research logic  is about wondering why  IxFP types has Ti as  th function     Se inf grip  Deku shows his Se when he uses the mines and the chunk of metal to win in the Obstacle Race   minutes           minutes             In early episodes  when the monster captures Bakugo and everyone is watching without doing anything  Izuku used his Se grip  he acted impulsively without thinking to save Bakugo    To all INFP voters    Where is deku Inf Te or Te grip    Why Deku should have Ti demon  the  th function in the stack    To all ISFJ voters    Why Deku should have Ni demon    Where is Deku s Ne grip ,infj
 Not all person that helps some people is a Fe   I get that point  and it s true  but here s what really relies on why Deku is a Fe user  Though Fi users can be totally possible of being very empathetic and caring  the way that this originates and proceeds has a key difference between Fi and Fe  Fi usually will have more difficulty to take apart the  good and bad  bias  usually being drown to quickly think with  good guys  and  bad guys  view  sometimes led by their impulsive extroverted perceiving function  Hear me out  it doesn t mean Fi is not possible of being more open minded and understand things in a scale of grays  is just that they will be more drown to this  and the most wounded their Si Ni is  and the worse they use Ne Se  the most biased they can be  which Deku s wounded childhood doesn t shows to have this behaviors    As you can notice  even by the whole superficial actions of a villain  Deku tries in some way to make a connection with them  trying to understand the hidden meaning of their actions and what led them to do that  his arc with Gentle Criminal is the example I address to this   Though  he reminds grounded about their state as villains  as their actions is something that is obviously affecting other people  regardless of what he feels in that moment   When trying to connect with them  he won t just give them a based meaning of  good or bad  and then  oh  so you don t get it  You deserve someone to give you a lesson    I m sorry for the superficiality of that part  I take in count how Fi manifests in fictional heroes and based on the fact that is feelings not based on the external world  I need to admit that s the way I usually think lol  He instead will get deeper  which takes him apart from other common Fi shounen protagonists  Also  his empathy will remind constant and transform by the external implications  doesn t matter if of a complete stranger or a known one   Even though I relate to him in a lot of ways I would admit that key difference between us  INFPs and INFJs  I would admit that INFPs have the same possibility about worrying to save everyone  but mostly comes from a wounded  somehow unhealthy  Si function and for the sense of wanting to calm the own wounded mind    P D  I had better words for expressing my opinion for this comment a week ago but the right words and the right feeling was kind of gone lol,infj
I heard from one of ppl that he looks like an INFJ with  w    but actually he is an INFJ fe subtype with  w    What do y all think  ,infj
He s obviously not a perceiver  He plans everything in advance  who says XXXP doesn t know cognitive functions ,infj
whoever voted INFP  Fi Ne Si Te    i genuienly wanna know why      i really dont see ne aux  maybe fi but i think its fe over fi  his Ni Ti usage is so strong as well,infj
Weird how extremely relatable he is despite having very different types    But  could someone explain why he s an INFJ and not a Fi dom  and  w  instead of  w   To me he seems rather IxFP  w  ish ,infj
if u vote anything than INFJ  just quit bro  U don t even need to watch all   seasons to tell Deku has NiFe  his Ni Fe is clearer than my skin wtf   Even in S   Ni Fe Ti Se  in the exact order  is clear asf  I m surprised tho at how despite getting bullied during his middle school era  he is still healthy  If I were him  I d be at least a bit unhealthy  Also  to everyone is still confused abt what his subtype is  I recommend reading this https   oceanmoonshine  wordpress com six stacks   I hope it s useful   ,infj
I realized that in the first chapter  when that monster captures Bakugo and everyone is watching without doing anything  for Izuku that was a stressful situation  where he had his clear Se grip  that even he said it  he ran to help him impulsively without thinking of anything else  This guy is a clear INFJ from head to toe  i love him ,infj
damn I ve just watched episode    of season   and Midoriya screams Ni Fe so much in this one lmao  his usage of cognitive function is really clear in it,infj
His main objective it s to be the strongest hero  Ne Fi   I don t know why people voted INFJ ,infj
I see some people asking where they see Ni in him  I d love to help  So I used to think he was an Fi dom but I use Objective Personality to type so if we use different systems that s fine  I typed him as an ENFJ via that system   If you use OP  it s because he s definitely a single decider   double observer and clearly doesn t have IxxJ traits   When looking at possibilities in matches  from UA  assignments or trying to save someone  he is able to use his Se  which although is his inferior or in my case  tertiary function  still must go in hand with Ni  to scan his environment and gather in the facts of it  and then plan accordingly and stick to the vision he creates  Of course  this is needed if you wish to save anyone  but say an Se dom may be a bit more impulsive about it and not actually create a plan and just rush in  or maybe even an Ne dom would do similarly as a result of lack of Si  He has an uncanny ability to narrow down ideas possibilities  I don t see him using Ne to expand upon possibilities  and follow through    Great character  I m happy to see a not  super masculine  male hero who has good usage of Fe    Let me know if you have any questions    hope this helps   Also  why social      Social   description of trying to  ally  with people he looks up to and admiring people who live up to certain values ideals really sounds like him   gen,infj
I m no expert about instinctual variants  but I can easily tell that this kid  who breaks his arm or leg every    seconds passes in Africa  is self preservation blind,infj
His Ni Fe is so strong    He focuses so much on the future and blackout so much  Always in his mind  That s Ni    He s good at understanding people s feelings and isn t afraid to show his emotions as well and the way he understands people s struggles and wants to help them overcome it screams Fe  He s too invested in people s feelings to not be an Fe    All of that combined with his use of Ti in those critical situations and coming up with full strategies in his head on the spot    An INFJ at it s finest,infj
I read over some stuff regarding   and    and while it s surprising just how much SP   fits Midoriya  some of the stuff I read let me think he s typed correctly here   However  there s talk about what type of   he would be which I think is justified considering how SO   is depicted as  cold and efficient  even by Naranjo himself  who is responsible for the creation of these types in the first place  With that said  there is more to SO   than just their rigid disposition  and considering the examples Naranjo himself uses to illustrate the mentality of this    Midoriya being a Social   fits  even if his warm  caring  and anxious personality might SEEM like SP     Transformation Through Insight        by Claudio Naranjo  pg         According to the subtype  self accusation or accusation of others may be in the foreground   and they are dynamically linked through the mechanisms of projection and identification with the aggressor     Basic extensions of these are distrust of others AND INSECURITY  Whichever is on the surface  distrust of others and self accusation or guilt and insecurity   however both apply  E  finds it difficult to trust the world  to trust authority  TO TRUST HIS OR HER SENSES  TO TRUST HIS JUDGEMENT AND ABILITY TO DISCERN WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO MOMENT AFTER MOMENT    This is some stuff that fits why he could be a     This next part though  I found more accurate for him    The more distrust  the more need to make up for it through reliable authority   THE GREATER THE NEED FOR AN AUTHORITY ADMIRABLE ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED  THIS NEED MAY LEAD TO THE CREATION OF IDOLS  A TENDENCY TO HERO WORSHIP  A CONSTRUCTION OF PERSONAL DREAMS  AS IN DON QUIXOTE  WHO DOES NOT FOLLOW A PERSON OR PARTY  BUT THE KNIGHT ERRANT IN HIS IMAGINATION   others supports  points of references or guides    pg            They are easily seduced by mystification  by grandiosity  THEY ARE ATTRACTED BY IDOLS  ALL TOO IDEALISTIC  AND GRAVITATE TOWARD THE SUBLIME    MANY TIMES IN HIS ADVENTURE DON QUIXOTE BELIEVES THAT HE IS CARRYING OUT GOOD DEEDS  WHEN ACTUALLY HE IS ONLY EXPRESSING HIS NEED TO BE A HERO    Finally  the most prominent comparison is to another SO   who does not fit the  cold  SO   we are familiar with  but who is nonetheless used as an example for this type  Gandhi  somebody who is constantly mistyped as    and is contrasted with Dostoyevsky  an SP      pg            If Dostoyevsky it is the warmth of brotherly love and self giving in the context of family and loyalty that are most striking  in Gandhi it is the sense of duty   Gandhi as a child WAS VERY SHY AND WITHDRAWN  AND HE RECOUNTS IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THAT HIS BOOKS AND LESSONS WERE HIS ONLY COMPANIONS  AFTER SCHOOL HOURS HE RAN BACK HOME BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR TO TALK TO ANYBODY  When at the age of the thirteen he was married to an assertively independent girl  it shamed and infuriated him that she showed no fear of the dark  whereas he could not bear to sleep in an unlighted room   Then there was a striking change  SHYNESS VANISHED WHEN GANDHI DARED TO SERVE HIS FELLOW BEINGS      That s just the stuff that s mostly relevant to Midoriya  and I made a mistake in my assessment of him earlier  I believed that Midoriya was someone who rarely struggled with fear throughout the story  and while that s somewhat true because how capable he is of overcoming his fear whenever necessary  Midoriya is someone who is brave when it s for the sake of others  not for himself   When Bakugo bullies and intimidates him in middle school  he backs away and retreats shamefully   V     Midoriya Izuku  The Origin    jpg  But even as a kid  was willing to stand up to Bakugo for the sake of others    Same exact thing happened during the UA Entrance Exam    When the big robot appeared  he turned away and ran without thinking twice about it    Fussing over what to do  about how he didn t get the points he needed  about how he would disappoint his hero  but the moment he saw Uraraka in need of help    Everything disappeared  Right away  he stopped thinking  and immediately sprung into action    Without even thinking about it    doubt    hesitation    cowardice  He acted from instinct  and did what he thought he had to do  without any inhibition  His hero worship  his fanaticism  his aspiration to heroism  his sacrifice to society  I do think now that Midoriya s heart fix is    but as a main type    is okay  If Don Quixote and Gandhi can be SO    then Midoriya fits also  even if he isn t cold and rigid ,infj
Can someone pls explain to me why this guy is type as an so sx instead of so sp or sp so cuz it makes much more sense than him having an sx in his variant ,infj
What s his moral alignment ,infj
 Self preservation  These Sixes seek to escape anxiety by seeking the security of protection  therefore  they become dependent on others  They have a passion for compensating for the fear of separation  which manifests as warm and friendly temperament  Their driving need is therefore for something like  neurotic  friendship or warmth  which makes this subtype the warmest of these Sixes  They tend to be in a good mood and have a generally pleasant disposition  They look for a bond of intimacy and trust in their relationships  and they fear disappointing others  especially those who are closest to them  Being warm is their way of getting people to be friendly so they won t be attacked     Social six  Archetypally  the guidelines of whatever system a Social Six follows become a kind of replacement authority for the first authority the parent  usually the father  While they may have rebelled against or been disappointed by their actual father  they look for a good authority in life as a way of finding security  Total submission and obedience to authority  and the rules associated with authority  helps them feel safe in the world  Naranjo points out  however  that choosing the wrong authority can be a problem for Social Sixes   Instead of believing in the person who is right  they tend to believe in people who speak as if they were right  and who have the special gift of making themselves believed    Of all heroes  the Symbol of Peace  All Might  has impacted and modeled Izuku s life the most  Many of Izuku s decisions and actions result from his desire to become a Pro Hero similar to All Might  and thus he has a great devotion to him   When the doctor said he s quirkless and his mother replied  I m sorry Izuku  I wish things were different  he didn t listen to her  He did want her to support him yes but he didn t rely or depend on it  He doesn t want protection of other people  he doesn t seek support of his mother or classmates  Instead he relied on the idea of becoming a hero like All might  Since they didn t support his dream  he ignored their words and kept going  He believed all might when he said  meddling when you don t need to is the essence of a hero   His authority is all might and he obeys whatever all might tells him to do  I think that s why he s a social   over self preservation   ,infj
can some explain why  w  than  w  ,infj
https   www beatricechestnut com posts instinctual subtypes   Self Preservation Fours are stoic  strong  and long suffering emotionally sensitive on the inside  they often don t communicate their darker feelings to others  While they feel things deeply  and may feel sad inside  they often have a sunny  upbeat exterior  as they often received the message early on that their caretakers couldn t handle their pain or darker emotions  They may feel anxious inside  but they tough things out and have a high tolerance for frustration    heh,infj
Why INFJ  INFJs are known for being wise  would a wise person break they are bones   i dont think so    Deku  is far too simple minded and childish to take on the title of INFJ,infj
Is breaking bones often an example of the Se inf he has ,infj
Wanted to put my two cents as to why Midoriya uses Fe over Fi    First of all  having a strong sense of morality doesn t necessarily equal Fi  Midoriya does have strong morals  yes  but they re more directed pointed towards others  He even puts his own well being for the sake of helping others  As he s said before  the main reason he wants to be a hero is to help others   I want to save people with a smile     Then again  being selfless and empathetic doesn t necessarily equal Fe either  Both Fi and Fe are capable of being so  The thing is that Fe tends to make decisions by focusing on how it s going to have repercussions on others and how it s going to affect them  since Fe users are usually focused on mantaining social harmony  as they are concerned with the feelings of the group    while Fi tends to give more weight to their morals and how they personally feel when it comes to making a decision  Fi users focus more on themselves as they are more in tune with their inner values  It is worth nothing that this doesn t mean they re selfish  though     I was rewatching the fight scene between Deku and Bakugo  and there s something Midoriya says that I found interesting  Talking about Bakugo  he says  But the image of  victory  I have inside me is of you  I want to beat you  the incarnation of victory   This might seem like Fi at first  especially comparing him to another character like Yamaguchi  from Haikyuu   an INFP  Yamaguchi s main motivation to get better is to be as good as the rest  AKA  he focuses more on improving himself and his skills to keep up with the rest  instead of having more of a team focused goal like an Fe user would  BUT here s something indispensable  Notice how Deku immediately adds after   In order to meet the expectations of All Might  who chose me    He wants to beat Bakugo not only for his own gain  but also because he wants to meet the expectations of other people he admire and holds close to him   Yet  let s go with Midoriya s main focus goal for becoming a hero  And what is better than the quote  Win by saving people  and save people by winning  to sum it up  This phrase refers to both Midoriya and Bakugou  respectively  In this case  win by saving people   Fe  being about Midoriya and  save people by winning   Te  about Bakugou  Midoriya s main priority is to save people  while giving to himself least priority in order to do so  Fe   while Bakugou s priority is to win and efficiency in general  Te   This is something we see throughout the anime and manga ,infj
I don t think he s a   so sx as well  Soc  s  personality is cold and strict  sx  s are overly aggressive  and sp  s is kind and anxious  which sounds most like Deku    Based off of Naranjo   https   docs google com document d  MN AcuORbsYE KrtN zuUw  WLiVI cSzsFd  hZ fo edit,infj
Maybe I m just confused but how is he Fe over Fi  Is it just because he s selfless and empathetic  In the beginning of the story he wants to live up to his ideals of being a hero even though everyone in his life has told him he can t do it  Idk I guess I don t really understand Fe as a function because I personally am an Fi dom but being selfless and empathetic is one of my values so I don t really know what makes Fe different  Could someone explain why he s Fe and not Fi ,infj
I m going to advocate for ELVF   EVLF  Flexible Logic   Insecure Volition over vice versa      The Flexible Position wants to engage in the journeys they desire while processing the information surrounding it  They tend to be completely open to all opinions of the aspect  and rarely ever feel vulnerable or as if they should protect themselves  If someone needs help  or walked through a process  this position will gladly do so     L   Love to openly philosophize of underlying theories and pieces of knowledge  Will go to great lengths to explain or discover the inner workings of an idea  Tend to be fascinated by rules and formal logic  Are drawn to philosophical thoughts and exercises with multiple participants  Highly trust their own abilities to investigate reasons behind any action  Appreciate opinions regardless of how aggressive they are  Are great at evolving discussion by playing devil s advocate  Willing to share sources to help others understand how things operate on a fundamental level     Are open to helping solve confusion with others regarding logic  Patience with those who are unsure or skeptical of how things work  Have an inherent fearlessness when diving into the details of any theory  Believe that anyone can learn anything if they are willing to invest time into it  Walk people through their proofs and arguments while explaining all possibilities  Are accepting of those that ask for help with logic  Extremely patient with people who are insecure about their own intellect     May bother others too much about their opinions which can cause a tense atmosphere  May spend too much time on very simple ideas in order to expand their mind  Have a tendency to overlook what is most efficient solution to a logical puzzle  Can be easily persuaded by others without fully exploring what they believe themselves    Deku discovering legs  anyone  All jokes aside  Flexible Logic fits Deku to a T     The Insecure Position wants to engage in the journeys they desire while processing the information surrounding it  They tend to be unsure  hesitant  and apprehensive towards the aspect  and feel intense vulnerability that they must protect  The Insecure Position often needs help  and desires to be walked through the process with care and respect  or else they can react badly     V   Will feel anxious about large workloads and  insecure in how their duties to perform are perceived by others  Tend to feel doubtful about their potential and how motivated or inspired they can feel   May overestimate how much motivation something requires  Tendency to panic or become anxious when their energy level slips lower without warning   Can become worried and unsure of how to overcome obstacles  Will over analyze and replay things they have accomplished recently  unsure of the next best step to take      Tend to push themselves to settle inner conflicts about their own capabilities  Will overexert themselves in an effort to avoid the doubt cluttering their mind  May make promises and overestimate their ability to keep the promise     Tend to ignore obstacles as if they do not exist  Can remain unmoved and unshakable to anyone who tries to exert their will  stonewalling the opponent    I think this most definitely shows in the current manga arc  which I won t elaborate for spoiler reasons  but I m sure anime onlys are able to relate this to Deku ,infj
Why EVLF and not ELVF  I know he has some strong V  however  shouldn t L be a bit higher  Though I agree with E being the first and F being the last,infj
I read some information on IVS since I m still learning about typology  At first I went with so sx but as I read more information on IVS I do not believe Izuku is a so sx he s more of a sp so can u guys explain to me how he s an soc  instead of self preservation   cuz I do not see him as an Soc  at all ,infj
Where do people see soc  in Midoriya  Can someone explain it to me  He s much too hesitant for a social six  Sp  is likely  or maybe even sp   but people vote so sx anyway because  sp blind   Sp  because of how he s more oriented towards making connections with people to feel safe over following rules and procedures so nothing bad would happen  which is why social sixes can actually come off as type ones in that case  Soc  could be his second variant  but sp  appears to be more likely in his case ,infj
I m not sure about him being a six can u guys explain to me how s he a six cuz I m not that good at typing with enneagrams  ,infj
the last   owners of OFA really pushed over the edge   the amounts of Fe all might and Midoriya have are over the top  Hirokoshi showed that in the later arc of the manga where deku was so deep into Ni Fe that ignored the feelings of his friends    ignored  is not the right word  because he care about them but coundl t think about a better way of solving things   He will supass all might by staying closer to his friends as Shigaraki will supass AFO by doing the same  i hope so  at least  ,infj
One question  Are you guys using Jung definitions to type this character  If yes  so why the hell he s J  Jung Ni correlates more an introverted perceive type  So  INXP  And If he is oriented to feeling   thinking  that s will makes him INFP ,infj
https   youtu be vH XHC Ddmw  Bakugo rescue plan   Perfect use of Ni Fe,infj
Does anyone have any explanations for his AP  Both EVLF and ELVF seem plausible ,infj
The reason deku is an INFJ and fits almost every stereotypes is because the damn writer is also an INFJ  There you got my answer  Great writer doe btw  Pretty cool dude,infj
An example of him showing Ni i think would be how he zones out and mutters a lot  ,infj
I m a INFJ and I can swear Deku is INFJ  Fe and Ti are obvious  Ni Se  Deku is idealist  He is constantly focused on his dream  since the first episode  Midoriya was trying to ignoring the reality  the fact he would never became a hero because he didn t have a quirk  This is an example of Se inf  As an INFJ  in some cases  I acted in the same way  I try to ignore the reality  All Might  an ENFJ  is more realist than Deku  In the second episode  He told to Deku he can t become a hero  Deku is a planner  He uses his Ni TI  INFJ are good planner  but we need time  We aren t fast    Both Ni and Si collect and catalogue things  Deku s notebook   but Si dom they do it through direct and empiric experiences  while Ni dom do it through intuitions  Deku he didn t do experiences before he became an hero  We INFJ are capable to repeat the same song  the same video for months without get tired of it  Midoriya is an healthy INFJ  but he isn t mature  not yet   I developed more my Ti and Se fuctions  but I m unhealthy  lol ,infj
Ni future and deku likes future Fe because one for all is a power of sharing and giving and we all know fi users cannot share so Fe Ti because he made a few logical conclusions and decisions Se because good fighting and making costumes of all might  So according to this detailed and no so through analysis we can say deku is INFJ,infj
 i get that this power was first meant to destroy that evil but you ve all given your lives to link the chain this far and i think that there s another big purpose behind it all   Si vs Ni   Ni is concerned with finding meanings and attaching that meanings to things  it easily connects things to each other and to forms a greater whole    Si would deal with situations things themselves  rather than relationships each thing has with another thing  it would search for details  for example  strings of a guitar  Si would see each string as something important  details that make guitar useful  Ni would see the whole guitar as things that are connected to each other which makes it something  unique   it might be a bad example but it was worth trying   Si users would experience something real time  but then they would quickly start comparing it to stored memories in their heads    there are people who think that Ni can t think about past  it s wrong  Ni relies on patterns and intuitive processes no matter what they happen  past or present doesn t matter   Si relies on past experiences    deku is driven by his dreams and visions  he keeps recognizing patterns and events  connects them to calculate upcoming future  take sports festivals arc  for example  his whole fighting style is based on his analytical skills  predicting opponents  moves  he acknowledges and picks up patters easily  then uses them to make framework of action   i don t know why people are voting for INFP  midoria shows no signs of Fi and Te  i can t even see any Ne in him  deku s Fe is obvious  he  always wanted to become a hero  not because it s in his morals  he wanted to protect people  he wanted to make sure everyone is safe  of course Fi can be like that too  but Fe is more concerned about people s relationships and social harmony which you can see in deku  he has caring nature  he wants to be helpful  when he can t help people he doubts himself and gets worried  also can see how he wants to live up to people s expectations  clear Fe user   midoria analyses each hero and villain in depths  takes notes so he can make plans to win a fight against them  it s his whole character ,infj
something about INFJ protagonists makes my heart go soft  add  There s a quote Aizawa says about him that reminds me of how Ni doms operate     Rather than using his experience  he created a situation to use his experience   Clear Ni Se axis   From Gran Torino   Analysis and prediction  huh  But you re too stiff  Your senses are not in harmony   An observation of Ni Ti and inferior Se in the most stereotypical way ever  lol ,infj
       To share something that I ve replied to a comment before     Head type     or gut     type  I would say head type for sure     Nines are out of touch with their instinctual drives  Nines believe that expressing their views or asserting their needs will cause conflict or lack of harmony  Nines shut down most of their instincts by repressing and denying their own wants and needs      This is the antithesis of Deku  tbh  look at how he stood up to Bakugo as a kid     Sixes are constantly aware of their anxiety and always react against it  Sometimes  they rely on their authority to allay their fears  sometimes they will courageously confront their fears directly      IMO  relying on authority is a great deal of what Deku does  or when he doesn t have authority  he attaches to Bakugo  and when he doesn t have Bakugo  he attaches to the knowledge he s painstakingly gathered for himself   w        He s also someone who is quite high strung and anxious as a whole  but often has the guts to courageously fight against it though usually due to being fueled by certain attachments to individuals  Bakugo  Iida  etc   or beliefs  basically internalizing all that is All Might and striving to live up to what he stands for               Reactive     or positive outlook      I d say reactive  It ties back to his tendency to lash out under stress    Nines  therefore  try to deny or avoid these problems by strengthening their attachment to the status quo  These problems will take care of themselves  so why bother dealing with them      I think Deku rarely does this  He seems to tend to dwell on and find ways to handle the problems  to overcome his anxiety             This one is key  compliant     or withdrawn      I would say compliant for sure  It s actually crazy how much he complies to those authority figures and beliefs in his life       And this one too  does he attach in a   way or a   way  I m seeing   a lot more  like his attachment to All Might  to Bakugo  to his notebooks  etc       Sixes seek support systems through people  parent  teacher  mentor  friends   a belief system  political  philosophical  religious   an institution  the law  the military  a company  a union  the family   or other affiliations  sports team  self help book  traditions  rules  routines   All of these sources provide the Six with a sense of stability and guidance  The more support systems the Six has  the more secure she will feel      There s a moment in the manga where Deku charges forward and All Might looks up at him wistfully  and says  you don t look back at me anymore   And then later during a hot pot party  Deku reflects back at how much his life has changed  and how he never could have imagined getting on good terms with Bakugo again  and he says  I feel so blessed       And I think that s a good sign of his movement away from the blind reliance and attachment to All Might as a belief and authority figure  which is very much like a core    into a more secure and harmonious spot internally  like the positive movement towards       Similarly his attachment to his notebooks  and his attachment to his ideas seem to dominate over his attachment to his internal peace  which supports head type over gut type  he is not out of touch with his anger  but rather his inner guidance    Ex  think of how easily he started parroting what All Might was when asked what kind of hero he wants to be  and only manages to reflect inwards on what  he  personally wants after Mirio asks him   This lack of self awareness and focus on one s self and identity also points away from an image type  especially core      and   would be more plausible in defining self based on outward factors naturally  ,infj
Deku is for sure an ESFP  just a little more on the shy side  He pushes himself hard and breaks a lot of bones in his body just for his goals  like an ESFP would  He freezes when pretty girls talk to him because no one is ever attracted to ESFPs  Deku is quite the ray of sunshine like an ESFP  his Se use is very obvious when he s using his quirk ,infj
Disintegration to   results in the anxiety we see in him  Integration to   in his goal to self improve  for the greater good of others in the context of INFJ   I don t see the core fear or desire of an enneagram   in terms of needing support  stability and guidance like I do in an INFJ  w  such as Armin from AOT ,infj
pre ramble tldr  Deku may come off with the appearance of an INFP  but due to a change of pace with the manga  he s a lot more easily identifiable as an INFJ  although I still think certain key elements and ideas behind him stay consistent  which is why he is still the same character    I think that Deku had initially conveyed INFP ish characteristics for the majority of the anime manga duration  but we re slowly moving on  in the anime  towards the Deku in the manga that appears more akin to an INFJ    I think this change could be attributed to the course of the story shifting due to the ending being changed and or Horikoshi s ideas on the topics of mha being put into fruition  a big reason why some people may dislike mha is because the first   seasons play off of shonen tropes  which I think Horikoshi wishes to show the merit in whilst also  way later on  which is why people see the story as far too drawn out  turning them on their heads and showing the possible dim reality to them  he s sort of putting pre established values and ideas on hero society to the test  and I think dekus initial appearance of being a  typical  shonen protagonist  changing into something different  might be a result of that  This might also be why certain plot points are considered bland by many people  seeing as they do take some time to pay off ,infj
i love deku but i feel like in the manga he s kind of changing idek tbh,infj
Guys am I the only on that sees  w  in deku a lot lately  Especially in the manga   He is turning into what a  w  becomes when things become too overwhelming  INFJ  w  All of these words and strong convictions he always have   What he keeps saying screams  w   he doesn t want anyone to worry about him and doesn t want anyone to be conflicted and in chaos  The whole   self   around     the way a type   treats themselves literally fits whatever deku does  And with the w   Guys please consider this possibility  the   made sense to me   I m reading everything on  w  right now and it s so him  Please anyone tell me what do they think of it  ,infj
bruh this boy is pure NiFe  even his tertiary Ti is so well developed  he loves to analyze people and their powers  i love him sm,infj
INFP   Fi  deku is much more value based and achieving his OWN goals but struggles to show those goals  inf TE   NE  where are you seeing NI  This kid is not looking towards the future but more on the possibilities towards the future   SI  he looks at the past and dwells on it  INF  TE  I said that in the beginning   Plus he s a big dreamer and cries way too much,infj
Would you guys say that deku in the manga is disintegrating into an unhealthy   ,infj
Some manga spoilers ahead  but really solidifies Ni dom for me above all else   https   imgur com a uweIYpL  Near the end  note Deku s speech     I get that this power was first meant to destroy that evil  But you ve all given your lives to link the chain this far   and I think that there s another big purpose behind it all      Introverted perception as a whole is concerned with meaning and attaching meaning to things  However  Ni s meanings are underlying and holistic  and able to be related to other meanings easily to form a greater whole      This means that there is a natural seeking for something  greater  that connects everything and all their  past  experiences together  looking past what is purely given and conceptualizing a more ideal situation     As has also said about Ni in the stack    Let s put it this way  the phrase  there has to be more to this  is usually one that boils in the minds of ISxP a lot  while  there must be a reason for it  is the one that bugs INxJ more      For Si  each particular detail is a separate impression  and the meaning is directly tied to the impressions are not intrinsically connected to other ones  It s categorical and cataloguing  like viewing each tree in the forest as separate but important     Because Si is a sensing function and thus deals with the  things themselves  rather than the  relationships between things   there is no weaving of those impressions into some greater whole  and thus a more reductionistic and grounded view on the meanings in their lives  and how to live their lives  Check out Marcus Aurelius  page for what that entails in an ISFJ     Now look at how Jung describes the Ni type s search for meaning as well    The moral problem comes into being when the intuitive tries to relate himself to his vision  when he is no longer satisfied with mere perception and its  sthetic shaping and estimation  but confronts the question  What does this mean for me and for the world  What emerges from this vision in the way of a duty or task  either for me or for the world    Doesn t this describe Deku to a T  In the past events  and even in the manga now ,infj
not yall voting INFP because hes sensitive  Im having trouble typing him though  He s either an ISFJ and INFJ  Can anyone explain their pov ,infj
That s pretty sad to see that INFP has more votes than ISFJ just because of stereotypes  THE WRONG ONES  This guy has absolutely no Fi  like at all  His Fe is very evident  Ni dom makes no sense  people are confusing his anxieties and neuroses with Ni  It is  w  and a not healthy relation with inferior Ne   Ni is symbolism  archetypal  embodying a concept  visualizing unconscious images and taking meaning out of it  bringing meaning to those images  Ni is see life in an unrealistic scope  disconnected from factual reality and to be somewhat reductionist in that scope by searching for meanings  Ni is not predicting the future  it is not planning  it is not being    steps ahead  Can we have demonstrations like that  Yes  we see this in other animes  but it s not the case with Izuku or Todoroki  I can better explain his Si later ,infj
i like how IXFJs use Ti tert  midoriya use it to get out of a complicated situation in a battle  this prove you don t have to be a thinker to be smart and you don t have to be a feeler to be dumb,infj
Because there seems to be a war between Si vs  Ni here  I ll throw in my two cents too   Si organizes and stores sensory information  At it s very core it s all about mainainance  Be it keeping the house clean or keeping the supplys stocked  In combination with Fe I ve seen people notice small diffrences in the health of other people  Si knows how the person should look when they are healthy and instantly notices the difference   Ni organizes and stores patterns  One thing you can see  that Ni doms do all the time  is create the perfect plan for every possible situation  this is becasue of the Se inferior  You dont have to worry about the current situation  if you planned a perfect response month beforehand  You can see Midoriya doing that in the very first episode  He stores all the patterns of his favourite heros  attacks  moves  quirks   everything  He analyzes these with his very developed Ti  I think we can all agree on this one   If he gets into a stressing situation  he only gathers the absolute minimum amount of Se information and then instantly falls back to one of the patterns he has written down   In short  he overworks his Ni and also his Ti  so he only has to do as little Se as possible  This is how the function imbalance works  It s always hard to type fictional characters  because in most cases  they are not written with the functions in mind  Keeping that in mind  I still think INFJ is the closest thing to Deku s character  definetly not ISFJ ,infj
do personality blind spots play a role in the analysis of his character,infj
Very clear INFJ  but could understand why some people would think INFP  cough cough those Ne ish brainstorms lmao  but I definetely don t see much Fi or Si in him  He has a good understanding of the needs of others around him and knows how to strategize ahead of time to assess the best course of action  I ve also been thinking about this more   when he moves in his direction of disintegration  IMO I don t see him moving to   under stress  I know it s not the consensus on this site but please don t use that as an argument   I ve seen that garbage enough times here  But I think Zuko  for example is a   and you can see very clearly where he becomes more image conscious and tries to feed his ego by proving his worth and honor  even if it s not for himself or healthy reasons   I think people frequently confuse  s as  s when they re moving in their direction of stress  because they can act more  ish on the surface when moving in this direction  notice when moving in this direction  Deku becomes more anxious  self doubting and timid  but when moving in his direction of growth  he becomes more inspired  confident  and purposeful like a healthy     He also has a good perception of the needs of others  and can actively resolve conflict and promote harmony when he s at his best  When is he motivated by a desire for safety  security  and looks for this in others  Unless he s loyal to all might because it will secure his path to being the no   hero  Yeah  I don t think so lol  And if you see things differently or can explain otherwise  then explain so in a HELPFUL and RESPECTFUL way  Have a nice day   ,infj
i was confused about whether he s an INFJ or ENFJ for the longest time but I m pretty sure he s an INFJ now       spoiler warning  in the latest arc in the manga  he definitely seems to be in an Ni Ti loop  trying to get everything over as quickly as possible after getting away from everyone  yes  the big three and all might are with him  and so are his vestiges  but are they really  he hasn t been listening to them and just making quick decisions of the fly  inf Se   i only hope his actions backfire and he faces consequences  which make him realise he NEEDS to take the opinions of others into consideration and that he is not alone  something even Bakugo said back at the start of the war arc    edit  just going by stereotypical descriptions  he almost seems like an ISTP now  which is also why i m finally sure he s an INFJ  Ti   trying to understand the reasons behind things such as why villains chose the path they did  Se   taking quick and reckless decisions that get the job done  but at some expense  such as getting shot multiple times just to go head on into a situation instead of evading it as suggested by others   Ni   predicting the movements of a certain individual using sensory data and narrowing it down to one certain possibility each time ,infj
Can someone explain why he s  w  rather than  w  or  w  ,infj
He seems like an ISFJ to me judging by how he fights and analizes everything,infj
He s definitely on a Ni Fe loop I think that looks very obvious in the first episode,infj
Can someone explain his instinctual Variant to me please  I m still learning about it and would love to know more   ,infj
No guys he is INFP   I  he doesn t get along with Bakugou N  He likes to write in his private notebook  F  He cries P  He is smoll  Also He cries all the time textbook INFP,infj
Hello sweetheart  hope u have all a great day like you        I see Deku as Ni Fe user  he uses sooooo much Ni and Fe  he could be ENFJ two but his Ni is almost crazy  he is the definition of INFJ,infj
Any arguments for  w   Seems like a  w  to me ,infj
I really thought he was INFP due to his stereotypical INFP like behaviour,infj
I dont really get the   votes  especially the w  ones  I get he s anxious but so are other ennagram types like    And if he is a   then he s sx blind ,infj
Bro is the epitome of an Ni dom  He absolutely favors Ni   Si  Ni is not incapable of revisiting the past  Si relies on past EXPERIENCES to help cater to present events choices  Ni relies on patterns or intuitive processes  past or present  to discern potential events choices  Midoriya is entirely driven by his visions and dreams  His Ni Fe throughout the entirety of the show is insane  and one of the defining traits to his character and development  Not to mention inf Se  impulsive actions  decision making  and behavior when under pressure   Man straight shows almost absolutely zero Te  which would make sense IF we were to consider it his inferior function  but his Ti usage outweighs Te usage far more  Dude is a Ni dom  of course his intuitive nature is going to be hella strong      Midoriya continuously recognizes patterns and events to calculate probable futures  Actually  this is essentially the majority of his character  Let s take the Sports Festival Arc    Throughout the event  but particularly towards the end of the first event  Midoriya accurately predicts using linear strains of thought  patterns  and pure analytical skills to discern his opponents next move  This is totally not limited to this Arc alone  but Midoriya s fighting style as a whole     We can observe this tactic in almost every battle Midoriya interacts  He acknowledges  and picks up on patterns made by his opponents  which he then uses to craft a framework of action  His procedure of plan is virtually introverted intuition personified   Questioning where those INFP votes fail to see Midoriya s usage of Fe  as if saving others and being sacrificial of yourself isn t the singular fundamental to his philosophy as a hero during the entire series             Fe can still be moralistic while maintaining external values and harmony  I am assuming most of what is being mistaken as Fi is Ni  Midoriya is highly ambitious and visionary  His whole  I want to become a hero schtick to save people  can easily be misinterpreted as Fi  I would go as far to say Midoriya almost gluttonizes Fe in a way  He has a compassion for being helpful   This isn t to insight that Fi cannot be a philanthropist  but the moral jurisdiction which Fi and whatever the supporting function may be often works within deep rooted beliefs that can t be discerned the same as Midoriya s       Someone made an important comment saying that Midoriya often has Ni tunnel vision which I totally agree with  and is a very substantial argument that should be made when analyzing Midoriya s usage of Ni Fe    Lastly  I wanted to ask if anyone had any strong counter arguments against Midoriya being  w   or the potential of his heart triad being something else  Would be awesome to hear ,infj
 i will being the number   hero to help people   thats a Ni Fe thing,infj
Guys  he is INFJ  He gets Ni tunnel vision by hyper fixating on specific possibilities and ideas that are derived from a blurry impression that he has in his mind  Him wanting to be a hero since he was a child without even considering anything else is a part of his Ni  We see how difficult it is for him to entertain multiple ideas outside of his scope  Ne   It takes him quite a bit to figure out how to use OFA in a manner that doesn t maim him  Ni is a far less  interesting  function than it is described as online  I recommend watching the video linked below to understand how Ni works  it s v short  last     min of video      Fe  he pays heed to external emotion and is more concentrated on groups than himself  Morals do not equal Fi  It s rude to assume that Fe users have lesser morals or something  because that s not how it works  He is shown constantly focusing on others  saving them  how Eri  Iida  Todoroki  Bakugou  etc  may be feeling   This is all Fe projecting outward and feeling these people s emotions in a raw manner  without Fi s having to relate it to itself first  Deku does not have to put himself in people s shoes in order to feel what they are feeling  and this is why he has Fe Fi   Ti  instead of trusting external data immediately and adjusting his own internal logic to fit the data  he instead makes it go through the process of seeeing if it fits with his previous existing logic system instead  Ti users question what they are seeing instead of accepting it  Rather Te users  Iida  Todoroki  Bakugou  are far more willing to take hard data at its word and adjust itself to accommodate it  because Te does not question hard data  It cares about efficiency and getting things done so it can get results  and if the data is backed with evidence or is credible  then why doubt  Ti on the other hand  is the natural skeptic  It doubts what is seen  or wonders if there s something wrong with the data  if it doesn t fit in Ti s logic system   Ti is very Deku  he over analyzes literally everything and is shown to doubt things that are users don t  He relies on his Ni Ti a lot to figure things out too   Se  and finally  here we are  Deku takes external information in a concrete and raw fashion  and reacts to that  He usually processes this information with Ni  opposed to just reacting like a Se user would  but there are instances where he is forced to only use his Se  like the recent battle with Tomura  He was not fully conscious of his surroundings or what his enemy was doing  and almost got spiked    Thanks Bakugo  u a bro    Deku does not use Si as he does not focus on the impressions things made on him  When he remembers something  he doesn t really think of how that instance affected him  but rather remembers the memory for what it was  There are some moments of reflection that seem Si like  but every type can use Si to an extent  Those who don t have it in their main stack do not utilize it as well or as commonly through  We can see that when a high Si user like Iida or Uraraka reflect on memories  they think of what made impressions on them  Uraraka focuses on her parents encouragement to do what she lives  and how that made her want to be a hero to help them  Iida thinks about how his brother passed on his hero name to him or gave him advice on how to strengthen his quirk  and focuses on the impression that made on him   In constrast  Ni Se users like Todoroki  Bakugo  and Deku remember the memories for how they were   that is the main focus  They can still consider impressions  but most of their impressions are stemming from their Ni  see linked video above    So yeah  Deku is def INFJ  and there are great arguments for it scattered all throughout the page  Vote now   Edit  some of my original Si definition was actually socionics related  I removed and redescribed to avoid this being so convoluted ,infj
I reckon Deku as an INFP because to me his strong sense of morality just tells me his more of a Fi dom  I do consider INFJ a possibility  but INFP makes more sense to me   Edit  It ended up being a longggg thread lmao     no one s gonna ever read it lol,infj
Ok  but Ni is not necessarily future vision  Deku uses Si Ti for analyzing the moment  using sensorial data and personal impressions  and then decode this using the  imature  logical system of Ti terc  he does have a exactly preference of how future can goes on like an Ni dom  the only signal of that is his dream of becoming an hero  but it s a dream  he does plan that  there s no signal of preference in future exactly   I forget to say that yeah i think hes an ISFJ guys srry ,infj
I understand where the votes for ISFJ come from but you have to take into account the enneagram  It is not very common for an INFJ to be a    the   is more related to the ISxJ  Another thing is that Deku cares very little about his own integrity  we already see how he always sacrifices himself disproportionately for others  Which would mean that his Introverted Sensing is very low for an ISFJ  who are more cautious  on the other hand  introverted intuition makes INFJs very reckless ,infj
This is one of the most obvious INFJs out there  if he didn t cry so much there would probably be less INFP votes,infj
Those who voted So Sx just because he s  sp blind  should really read the    Subtypes  Social Sixes are concerned with their Duty all the time and are very precise with the guidelines they follow and what they do  They find security in following the rules of authority they chose to be a part of  Self preservation Sixes make connections with other people to feel safe and can come off as very affectionate when they do so  They are also prone to repressing their anger and would hesitate to share their opinions  so they may come off as timid in a sense  To me  Midoriya seems more like an Sp  with some counterphobic elements  He wants to make himself less of a threat to others so he can find safety with other people   I m looking to find reasons for the So Sx consensus other than  he s sp blind  ,infj
I m starting to appreciate aspects of him more  I think he s a prime example of a so subtype Type     Social Type  s act more on impulse  let go of rules   which is established in the very first episode  I also think his disregard for his physical well being in favor of success or protecting others is a clear cut case of inferior Se ,infj
I m having trouble deciding on whether Midoriya is Soc   or Sp    He does display some Cp traits but it s not the most prominent  His Cp traits mainly appear when someone else is in danger  like back in episode   when his body moved on its own to save Bakugou despite having no quirk at that time  I m not too sure on his Socionics either  Is it ok if someone can elaborate on that too ,infj
Me  Mom I want Nagisa  Mom  Hope  we have Nagisa at home remember   Nagisa at home    Anyways let s talk about his typing  I think his Ni Fe is extremely apparent  but I think it s also important to discuss his inferior Se  Deku uses Ni to connect and process information within his mind  and has trouble in more fast paced situations where he doesn t have anytime to think or create a strategy  We also see this with how while doing these things he can tend to ignore his surroundings  Like we saw in the first episode when he just jumped in to save Bakugou from the goo villain  To ISFJ voters  him looking back on his notebook and what all might taught him isn t Si  it s actually Ni connecting them and his new present to how he can create a strategy in the future so he is prepared in battle or for the next strike if that makes sense ,infj
I m literally scared of the INFP votes  I can see Fi  but his Ni is TOO obvious ,infj
I don t see how anybody could type this man INFP  Because he cries a lot  First of all  his Fe is extremely apparent   as All Might describes it  he has to learn not to be  selfless to a fault   At the core of his motivation is a desire to serve as the spitting image of the public s morals and well being  Secondly  his deductive Ni reasoning is all over the place  he s constantly deducing and solving the situations he s in systematically ,infj
Sooooo many parallels with Nagisa from Assassination Classroom  After I saw the first episode  I instantly knew he was a Ti user of some sort   The notebook was a giveaway ,infj
ni fe user hero  i feel he is so underrated in his own show but whatever good boy,infj
I feel like the INFP votes come from people who just started the serie and he s a still a crybaby  I think he s definetly Ni  Fe  and Ti user  He looks forward to future   a lot  He cares about innocent people he wants to safe as superhero and Eri  His superhero analysis notebook is a lot Ti like  I can t really name a situation with Si  so Se matches more  Se is really useful for superheros ,infj
Someone tell me why not EXXX ,infj
Why wouldn t deku be an ENFJ ,infj
I ve already provided four arguments in favor of the INFJ consensus  Technically five if you count the poorly written one I created when I was new to functions  But I cannot restrain myself from stating this   Introverted sensation is not the value of past memories and details  This misconception is by far one of the most bought into out of any other function mischaracterization that I ve seen  This argument will have an immense tone of condescension  my apologies in advance   Introverted sensation is the conceptualization of subjective impressions based upon sensory stimuli  This characterization was created by Carl Jung  In  The Introverted Sensation Type   this was stated as a comparison of Si and Se    Whereas  the extraverted sensation type is determined by the intensity of the objective influence  the introverted type is orientated by the intensity of the subjective sensation constituent released by the objective stimulus   The characterization of that introverted sensation relies on past experience is only truthfully valid when the  impression  from that event is utilized    It is not reliant on tradition  It is not reliant on past experience wholly  These notions were never implied in the original definition of the function  Here is some evidence   Here are  The Psychological Types   by Carl Jung    And here is the translation  by the user  st    The Si dom  traditionalist  notion likely stems from manifestations of inferior Ne  specifically  repressed  inferior Ne  that obscures impressions of objects to a point of perversion of the original object  Among healthy Si doms  it d be the negative conceptualization of ambiguity   None of that encapsulated the nature of Midoriya  His pursuit is in accordance with his holistic vision of the meaning being a hero has to him  The realization of the objective plausibility of his goals in accordance with his vision was the ultimate push for him to achieve actualization of his internalized meaning ,infj
Lol wow what a staggering minority  but I think Deku is actually ISFJ   Introverted Sensing  Si    Past focused  associated with detailed memory and respect for authority figures  At first i thought it was an anime thing with all the flashbacks and padding but no it s actually Deku literally flashing back to his past memories while looking down or staring at his hands  This happens at least   times per episode  Si is apparently the embodiment of anime flashbacks and this dude remembers everything and I mean everything  even the description of heroic events in articles he read when he was still a kid  I bet the millions of views on that All Might debut video must be from Deku  Good lord  he watches that video from     years ago whenever he gets home like it s some kind of tradition  I mean I ain t complaining it s a great video but damn  He also keeps an  Si book  where he organizes and stores sensory information about all the heroes he s observed over the years  Then there s his personal fighting style which is based not on his intuition but on his past experiences  He jumps like Gran Torino  moves like Bakugo  fights with a smile on his face like All Might and so on  Of course  I would be remiss if I didn t mention his tenacity  will power  drive  dedication and all that good stuff while working intensely hard for UA and achieving his goals  People seem to associate those traits only with Ni for some reason but that s not the case  The stereotype of ISTJs being some of the most hardworking people on the planet is pretty close to accurate  at least from my experience  Stannis Baratheon held Storm s End from a Navy and an army for a full year and had to feast on the corpses of starved soldiers to survive  Si definitely manifests those traits as well especially when it concerns patience  physical pain and long suffering   Extrovert Feeling  Fe    This one s pretty obvious  It is also I believe in his parent function  where an individual s sense of responsibility comes from according to Beebe s psychological type the Reservoir of Consciousness  When Deku sees someone in danger  it s like everything else comes second  That person becomes his priority and responsibility  His body has already moved to help them like a doctor on an airplane   Introverted thinking  Ti    The use of logic in the child position  Deku never misses a beat to think critically and analyze his opponents abilities  situations and theories in such an obnoxious manner   Shut up you damn nerd  as Bakugo would say  No offense to my IxFJs out there   Extraverted Intuition  Ne    The function of pattern recognition and future possibilities  I m guessing this is why some people voted INFP  I agree that Deku does indeed have moments where he talks about the  what ifs   and the  what could be s  in his environment and the people around him but i noticed that he only does so in moments of stress  fear and insecurity  which is indicative of an inferior function  Take the attack on the USJ for example  S  E    after they fought bravely against the villains and Tsu gets them off the boat  Deku begins to spiral over the past and worst case scenarios  Comparing that to an actual Ni Se dom like Todoroki who is always   steps ahead of his opponents in the present  Deku instead kept going on about how lucky they were that the villains all gathered in one place  and how he should ve been more careful because they would have been screwed if the villains left behind some reserve units underwater to ambush them later  That seems like Si Ne to me  That episode also highlights how indecisive   slow he is to act in the face of multiple possibilities  Like when he  saw  Tsu s death in the intuitive realm  The land of  that never actually happened    which crippled his ability to react on time in the sensory realm  The land of the present and tangible   One other reason I don t believe he is Ni or Ne dom is his lack of curiosity with One for All  He never wondered about the potential possibilities of such an ability  never asked what if someone got his DNA by accident  or what other quirks could he manifest besides super strength since it s the cultivation of power from previous users  or what happens to All might now that he s passed it on  things an Ni dom would ponder about in bed at  am  But instead he was more focused on  how he s never heard of this ability before in the past and how it s never been brought up in past debates  is it because a quirk like that has never existed since the dawn of history     Based on these functions  I would say INFP is much more likely than INFJ especially since Se inferior is pretty much nonexistent  A consistent Si user with Ne inferior would make Deku an ISFJ ,infj
why phleg mel instead of phlegmatic  dominant   ,infj
geeze his Ni    I dont even get how you can vote INFP and overlook the fact that his Ni usage is about some of the most obvious Ni usage of any fictional characters   also the auxilary Fe    woah   he prioritizes others and their feelings SO much that the only reason he ISNT an Fe dom is again because of his crazy Ni usage,infj
I love how his Ni comes through as clearly as an extroverted function,infj
I really don t have to say much about this one   There s no intuitive bias  no cherry   picking of specific actions to support a function  his Ni is just legitimately evident in his ability to gradually pick up on the behavioral patterns of opposing forces and threats and use them to predict the outcomes of the battles that may take place  This  as well as his disposition to see the world  as well as what it means to be a hero  through a distorted Ni lens   rose colored glasses  if you will   That makes Ni evident  Can t forget the consistent  NASTY unconscious use of the inf Se   SP blind combo either   It s this that s evident in the story rather than with Si s more reality grounded collection of details  picking up on patterns with less purpose and more to support a subjective data collection to store specific perceptions of places  situations  and people   for either the sake of finding personal comfort and security in the familiar  or specific detail collection for later comparison in new experiences ,infj
He seems impossible to type    the way I see it he has every introverted function and none of the extraverted functions  His Ti  Fi  Ni and Si are all stronger than his Te  Fe  Ne and Se respectively and I know that s impossible but it s the only thing that makes sense to me ,infj
You cannot read chapter     and tell me Deku isn t an INFJ,infj
An INFJ who overindulges his Ni and Ti too much  especially at the present chapters  He has to work with his Se and reassess his Ni  I don t think that he learned anything about his journey at all and still clings on his rose tinted beliefs  Hell  even Shouto  a NI dom  learns anything about his encounter with Deku and makes slow but sure steps to make most of his situation while still maintaining the core of his ideals and beliefs  integrating from One to Seven  which he becomes more hopeful for the future  more accepting and becomes less judgmental  for example his treatment towards his father   This also extends to his fighting style as well  starting by utilizing creativity in his Quirk  which Deku seems to do as well with his Quirks  but that s just it   And for the love of god  even Bakugo starts to develop and utilize his Fi in via acknowledging the root cause of his bullying to Deku  knowing that there not all things can be solved by a hammer alone and he can t shoulder everything alone  especially in this trying times  also shows slow but sure signs of integration from Eight to Two by admitting weakness alone   Deku s basically a warning to any character who overuses his her dominant functions    He only reaches the average level of his Enneagram  And sometimes he disintegrates to Three  e g  nervous AF  lack of care towards his body in an effort to achieve expectations as the next bearer  crippling self esteem underneath his likable and helpful nature towards others  like he can help but others but never to himself  and how he always espouses the heroes and the gov t even if it s clear as day that they re corrupt   And if he does integrate to Nine  it s only average at best and simply becomes an average Nine  And I m not so sure whether Deku s a phobic or counterphobic Six  though I m leaning towards the former  Social Sixes are more likely to be phobic anyway  he never once stood up for himself against Bakugo when his bullying went too far  a cp  regardless of the instinctual variant won t stand for that and will immediately put Bakugo into his place by all means necessary  ,infj
didn t you realize that the same thing happens with cha eunwoo  there is debate between INFJ and ISFJ  and that it is a very good coincidence interests me   i agree with several arguments  regardless of the type they voted  maybe i lI should see again bnha lmao edit   w  supremacy,infj
I don t think he s w   more  w  because he is pretty quiet introvert and artistic  he even design his hown costume  w   he basically wants to be the strongest hero  the savior of everyone  very ambitious this dude     in his tritype cuz he s very analitical and has a profound and genuine thirst of knowledge for the Heroes    cuz he wants peace and armony And let s face it  sometimes it s too kawaii  ,infj
A little tough to type but I d definitely say Ni   Si  As another comment here said  he overworks his Ni to the point where a lot of his other functions are pretty underdeveloped  I would definitely think that chapter     put him through some stuff  maybe we could see him develop  That would be pretty cool to see,infj
who is suffering after the chap     leaks ,infj
I literally don t get INFP votes  if anything else then ISFP  with developed Ni,infj
Because there seems to be a war between Si vs  Ni here  I ll throw in my two cents too   Si organizes and stores sensory information  At it s very core it s all about mainainance  Be it keeping the house clean or keeping the supplys stocked  In combination with Fe I ve seen people notice small diffrences in the health of other people  Si knows how the person should look when they are healthy and instantly notices the difference    Ni organizes and stores patterns  One thing you can see  that Ni doms do all the time  is create the perfect plan for every possible situation  this is becasue of the Se inferior  You dont have to worry about the current situation  if you planned a perfect response month beforehand  You can see Midoriya doing that in the very first episode  He stores all the patterns of his favourite heros  attacks  moves  quirks   everything  He analyzes these with his very developed Ti  I think we can all agree on this one   If he gets into a stressing situation  he only gathers the absolute minimum amount of Se information and then instantly falls back to one of the patterns he has written down   In short  he overworks his Ni and also his Ti  so he only has to do as little Se as possible  This is how the function imbalance works   It s always hard to type fictional characters  because in most cases  they are not written with the functions in mind   Keeping that in mind  I still think INFJ is the closest thing to Deku s character  definetly not ISFJ ,infj
I currently see Midoriya as a Si dom  not a Ni dom    He carefully analyzes and makes notes of the opponent s movements  observing every detail and storing internally  and makes use of it in fights  using information that he stored to predict or make new movements with help of his internal logic  developed Ti tert   This is not Ni at all  It s also good to mention that he is meticulous  cautious and perfectionist in everything he does    Ne inf is shown a lot of times  since he doesn t seem to be very prepared for new situations  often reacting with anxiety until the adaptation occurs  However  he demonstrates a better use of Ne in battles  as he manages to use the environment to his advantage by observing the potential of things around him    He generally takes others as sources of inspiration  such as Uraraka and All Might  reinforcing the Si argument    So far I haven t seen any Se inf arguments  Arguments for Ni such as  he has a long term goal  are very stereotyped  I would really like to see an argument about INFJ  Ni Se ,infj
The intuitive bias is strong here  This guy is clearly Si dom or at least Si aux,infj
Not to be rude  but where is his Ni ,infj
Why INFJ  He s very meticulous in almost everything he does and contrasts his opponent s movements to his own notes  Also Inferior Se is never reckless unless under stress  however Deku has acted recklessly despite not being stressed  hence he can t really be INFJ ,infj
How do yall tie his mublung to functions  I think it s in his perceiving axis  but I am open to more input,infj
EDIT  NJ pattern is like Overhaul  xNTJ  or OFA  xNFJ   Using strategies of playing things from behind  For xNFJs it is usually about political or revolutionary themed actions   He has nothing like that  Just establishing tactics and rambling with detailed information ,infj
INFP voters why do u think he has Fi dom  ,infj
The Overhaul arc is a perfect example of Si vs Ni  Nighteyes  ISTJ  Foresight quirk is used in a Si way  future predictions are set in place immutable  unchangeable  Most times the Si processing beats out the Ni insight because it deals with concrete realities  However when      hit the fan  when it was life or death vs Overhaul  with Deku having every Fe Ti motivation to beat the      out of Overhaul  the Ni prevailed  There is always information and insight behind every situation  The future is never concrete  and if a Ni is strong enough the future will bend to its will   https   www youtube com watch v  BmS  LAlMY,infj
i know i m going to get sniped for this one     but in all honesty he doesn t feel like his Fe is in his  nd slot  he definitely has Fe   and typing him as INFJ makes a lot of sense given the way he s written  but i still stand by the fact that he s Ti Ne  which would fit with the large amounts of ppl who say INFJ   rd slot Ti   the most important thing for me is HOW he does his Fe  it feels like the  th slot to me  i know he s aware of others feelings  but i ve met INTPs whose Fe becomes hyper developed due to those they look up to or aspire to be like   which is part of the  th slot  dealing with who you want to be  the function you may see as something to strive for  izuku looks up to an Fe dom  All Might  and wants to be like him  so his Fe soars pretty far   but stay with me it s more than just  th slot Fe  he is also constantly propelled by Si  things that have happened to him  traditions  etc  they matter to izuku  his experiences shaped him and still stick with him  and in general memory is clearly very important to him   it s even part of why his dynamic with bakugou  ENTJ  is so important  they re two sides of the same coin  so much so they even fight for the same dream  the INTP ENTJ relationship often boils down to one being unperturbed by the others  harsh Te nature  while the other is perplexed or infuriated by Ti dom behavior   having Fi in your  th slot can lead to difficult emotions  particularly if the person is being abused or mistreated  this is very obvious with izuku   but because his Fe is so well developed  you can tell it doesn t take much to get a grip on his Fi when it counts  he is going off of what others believe  and what society needs  and can even sometimes engage his emotions in a healthy way   also note good as it is  his Fe still needs work   he doesn t always know how to deal with or engage others emotions  he struggled in the test with how to act when rescuing people and didn t realize until someone reprimanded him  he often seems at a loss with others  feelings  or can t intuit them naturally unless they are CLEARLY stated   think about bakugou  wouldn t he be better at knowing how his oldest friend feels without bakugou having to tell him point blank  he doesn t get it   for why i truly think he s a Ti dom  it comes down to how he interacts with the world  your very first slot    all izuku does throughout the whole series is think  he creates theories  concepts  and constantly is acquiring information  which he adds to his theories  in fact  if he didn t have a quirk  this would be his ultimate super power  he s a genius with compiling info and putting it to use  it s his biggest upper hand other than having the mac daddy of all quirks lol  when bakugou burns his journal  it means something  it s important  it s the sum of who he is at that point  that s why it was hurtful  it s not just a hobby or pass time  it s how izuku functions and who he is as a person   as for Ti to Ne  he applies all of this amazing info that he constantly takes in  processes it  then connects the dots to make it useful   and    i could even get into how bad he is with Se  where being in the moment and not in his own head seems nearly impossible  but i think i ve made a long enough comment   i m a huge izuku fan my bad  tl dr izuku loves Fe and is good at it but not perfect  see bakugou  the tests   primarily uses Ti to interact with the world  and makes strong Ne connections with the info he takes in ,infj
Remember when people voted him as Fi dom because he likes to cry and Ne aux because he rambles a lot lmao  I honestly expected a war between INFJ  ISFJ and ENFJ   EDIT  Oh my god I sorted by controversial comments and people used to type him as INTP and INTJ   ,infj
His Ni Ti and Se are so obvious to me  as well as his analytical and planning fighting strategy  seen in his Judgement index   If anyone has arguments for types other than INFJ  feel free to reply,infj
Excellent use of Ni Ti  His Ni makes him dedicated to his goals and invested in his little notebook too  I think it s really visible when he dives into it and scares everyone around him with the rumbling and notekeeping  His Ti is surprisingly developed  making him very analytical in fights ,infj
There is a google scholar article for a bachelor degree  School of Humanities and Media Studies  typing Boku no Hero Academia  the article is just about that  O  I will just copy and paste their analysis for Izuku Midoriya  Link   https   www diva portal org smash record jsf pid diva   A        dswid       The first character I analyzed is the protagonist  Izuku Midoriya        Midoriya Izuku   He is an initially Quirkless boy  who gains a strength enhancing Quirk  One For All  from All Might   Early on there are signs of Izuku s preference for introversion  I   Before attending U A   Izuku appears to be a lonely person with a small social circle  and even at his new school  he only becomes close friends with a few people  which is characteristic of introverts  Rushton             He is nervous and meek in many of his social interactions  especially when at the center of attention  observable by his downturned head  sweating and stuttering  Especially in the early chapters he is often seen with a hunched posture telling of a lack of self confidence in social situations  while extroverts  E  are portrayed to be the opposite  Kennedy            An example for his lack of social skills is when he meets Ochako for the first time and goes completely speechless  vol     no      Introverts  I  also  tend to detach themselves from the world around them   Carlyn             which is seen in the way Izuku easily sinks into his own thoughts  strategizing and analyzing situations  while without realizing it himself  starts to mumble his thoughts out loud   Izuku prefers intuition  N   Ever since his childhood  Izuku has been aspiring to become a Pro Hero despite finding out that he is Quirkless at the age of four  which hints at his overlooking of reality  a common feature among intuitives  N   Wolk   Nikolai      He has an analytical mind and is always coming to conclusions based on different clues  which could be expected of the creative intuitives  N   On one occasion  villains separate Izuku s classmates to different locations inside an outside facility of U A  called U S J  for short  which is a building with several different areas that imitate disaster sites to help with rescue training  vol           Izuku quickly figures out that the villains do not know their Quirks based on which location he and his friends were placed at  and this helps him come up with a plan to get out of the situation  Intuitives  N  also tend to be theoretical and it is apparent in Izuku s fighting  Many of his battle moves are based on the multiple notes he takes on other people s Quirks  which he proceeds to copy in real life   Another intuitive  N  feature Izuku displays is his learning through metaphors  since the way he realizes how to control his Quirk is by imagining himself as a taiyakicake  declaring  this taiyaki is me                      vol           In decision making  Izuku prefers feeling  F   Based on his choices  Izuku can be considered highly compassionate  which is a feeling  F  type trait  Wolk   Nikolai      There are multiple occasions in which he makes  what seem like  unwise choices with no regard for his own good  only concerned with other people s troubles or safety  Before he has a Quirk and attends U A   he runs to try and help Katsuki  who is captured by a dangerous villain  and only survives this situation due to All Might saving them both  vol     no      Addedly  in the school s sports competition  during Izuku s last one on one fight against his classmate  Sh to  vol     no       Izuku provokes him to fight using his fire power alongside his ice power  despite it ensuring Izuku s own loss  Sh to had earlier shared his aversion to using his other power with Izuku  but Izuku s encouragement during their fight helps Sh to begin to get over his personal issues regarding his fire power  It is clearly a feeling based decision as it in the end benefits Sh to but not Izuku   In Izuku s lifestyle  he prefers the judging  J  process  Judging types are said to be  concerned with planning operations  organizing activities  and  making decisions   Wolk   Nikolai      which is a fitting description for Izuku  As earlier pointed out  Izuku takes notes on people s Quirks on the regular and learns battle or fighting strategies based on them  which can be seen in volume    no       when he copies Katsuki s movements  Within these notes  he has already designed a superhero suit for himself and plans of an alias  vol     no      all written before he even had his own Quirk  In his battles  he is the planner or the strategist  like in the school s sports competition  or when he and his two friends need to escape from villains in volume    no       His need to plan ahead is seen once again  when they have to decide where they will go for an internship by choosing from a list hero agencies  and Izuku immerses himself into his thoughts thinking of the best choice ,infj
He tried to philosophize a frozen fish biscuit or something    A FISH  The most INFJ moment I ve ever seen in him ,infj
The INFP votes are making me laugh  His Ni Fe is so obvious,infj
In one of my previous comments  I equated Midoriya s original unrealistic idealism to Ni and immature Ti  Ni has already been explained quite a lot by many previously made threads  However  I think Ti has been relatively under evaluated  so I want to shed some light on this  This will include function axes  but I ll try to hone in on Ti         A description of healthy tertiary Ti  https   mbti notes tumblr com theory tert      When a person has been lucky in encountering support for tertiary Ti development and or they have put concerted effort into developing Ti in adulthood  they suddenly start to value being more assertive  self sufficient  capable  coherent  in beliefs   and self examining  which allows them to assume an equal position and a morally responsible role in their relationship to others society  Fe Ti balance     This is reminiscent of the development that he goes through pretty early on  When Bakugou confronts him after being accepted into UA  we see this assertiveness begin to present itself  We also see this earlier when he begins standing up for himself in the first episode chapter as well when people laugh at him when his desire to go to UA is put on display  but it s noticeably weaker    Quote from Chapter   of the manga   Th that s not necessarily true  Sure  there s no precedent  but    or as I ve also seen it written   It  it s not set in stone  You just say that because it has never happened    Quote from Chapter   of the manga   Someone  finally acknowledged me  They told me I could become a hero  Kacchan    I ve won the right   Y you can t stop me  I m headed to Yuuei       Progression in the improvement of assertion          Both demonstrate INFJ   INFP or ISFJ  as well  Quote one suggests that the norm has not been set  Fe  and  therefore  he could fulfil his vision  Ni Se  due to that gap in a known standard  Ti   Quote two reaffirms All Might s role in supporting his vision in fulfilling heroism  Ni Se  Fe   and proof that his speculation had the capacity to become reality  furthering the validity of a theory  Ti    I provided further detail in a previous post    Ti has an orientation to subjective logic  causing its mindset to follow a more theory   fact   theory track of mind  A lot of his early idealism resembled a theory without evidence  All of his ambitions are reaffirmed in his mind as unattempted milestones in his goal  playing into Ni Se   From    from st    Ti plays a role in the INFJ s idealism  seeking to discover all of the necessary deductions and principles from an intuitive idea and ensure that its structure is logically sound  ,infj
  based on INFJ functions     Ni   the way he analyzes is obvious  he uses his notes from the hero notebook  he takes every detail in a fight  analyzes his opponent  moment he is in  movements  everything    Fe   his way of being  that nice boy who seeks in every way the welfare of others  and the way to help them   Ti   his  obsession  to know how everything works  it s as if he wanted to put together a map  an example is the comedy scenes when izuku takes notes like crazy    Se   I think I could justify that this is izukus last option when solving something  an example is his combat with todoroki  just look for a video and see how he assimilates his surroundings to have a little advantage      sorry if you find any bugs  i m new to this and trying to learn ,infj
I like how he s more normal and realistic depiction of INFJs and one that omits the common  but somewhat justified stereotype of INFJs always being into philosophy and being these other wordly beings or at the very least being obsessed with that kind of stuff  Also  some of the better arguments for why he s an INFJ make me a little bit uncomfortable XD,infj
Can someone  please  explain me why his temperament is phlegmatic melancholic ,infj
I wanted it to be common sense that having morals  directions and values is  not  exclusive to Fi      We all have these things  it is human to have a moral compass and a need to follow it  Midoriya never gave up being a hero because his will was externalized  it came from a need to help others and establish an atmosphere of peace  to save people  it was such an external thing that he didn t even cared about achieving his powers in a different way   by one for all   Midoriya adjusts himself to please others  to create a better environment    It is worth remembering that Midoriya s Fe is an AUXILIARY function  His DOMINANT Ni is an internal function  which can end up confusing people about him being INFP  i guess ,infj
His notebook is very Ni of him  especially when he s able to fight bakugo by being able to predict his movements from observing the patterns of them for so long  Definitely an Fe more Fi  he says many times that he wants to become good enough at what he s doing that people won t have to worry about him  He also says that when he was being marked for being a hero in that hero testing place lol he lost most of his points from standing around  Se inferior ,infj
 The moral problem comes into being when the intuitive tries to relate himself to his vision  when he is no longer satisfied with mere perception and its  sthetic shaping and estimation  but confronts the question  What does this mean for me and for the world  What emerges from this vision in the way of a duty or task  either for me or for the world      Carl Jung   The Introverted Intuitive Type   Fi is not the only function that behaves in a manner that seeks to find its place  Where Fi aligns itself with its values and emotions  judgment   Ni seeks to align itself with its vision  perception   The overarching plot BNHA Midoriya s vision and his path to becoming the best hero  Midoriya s path to becoming a hero is very much in line with the vision he withholds  and as multiple other users have pointed out  Ni s tunnel visioned mindset orientates that kind of achieving mind  rather than one driven by solidified ideals  though his ideals are very present    This differs from Ne Si s orientation toward possibilities  Where dominant Si manifests itself as being weary of ambiguous  often negative possibility  Inf Ne   lower Si tends to make people more orientated toward expanding themselves through possibilities  The two meet grounds at a consideration of alternatives  the former tends to be more cautious and the latter  more welcoming   Another misconception that I often see is that Si is about past orientation and experience solely  which is not necessarily the case  Si apprehends its impressions of a subject  taking its perception of reality into account  more so than the concrete reality of what s going on  Paired with inferior Ne  that can make high Si users revert to their places of comfort    stated this on Kageyama s page concerning Si   Instead of seeing the pure intensity of a green color and apprehending it as it is  which Se would focus on   for example  Si apprehends its  greenness   a subjective sensory ideal of what green is    Perhaps this will help with differentiating the perceiving axes   Feel free to ask questions or request clarification  D  Also  please go read through other arguments on this page  Go through replies too  There is a lot of great content and justification for the consensus ,infj
A more INFJ  w  character I have never seen  I ve never even seen a more obvious type   person in my life,infj
No action without a thought  His low Se are well represented despite the fact he know how to fight   this break stereotype about inf Se   We can see a better Fe than Fi  I think with a good comprehension of other sentiment who is dont mediatise by his personnal experience  juste emotional link  The way he inspire other too seems more Fe  And a partiel use of Ti with his study on alter   Si can be use here also with a compulsion to note things I understand the INFP voter   I don t see ni  but I m not very clear with this function  I don t see ne too  and I clear with my aux lol  Sorry for my English  ,infj
If we put his Ni and Ti aside I understand the INFP votes bc I can see Fi in him too but his Fe is much stronger than his Fi  yes he does everything for his goals and values but he often puts his emotions aside and tries to understand people who don t act or think like him  this boy is the ultimate enemy of I m Not Here To Make Friends type of characters like Bakugou  Shinsou or Todoroki  He brings people together  MANGA SPOILERS     Based on the current manga chapters  I think we will see his Fi fading from now on  Deku and others will begin to question the hero society and their beliefs ,infj
I like Izuku  I think he s a more realistic representation of INFJs compared to the average ones in fiction  I m assuming the reason why he got so many INFP votes  is bc of the archetype of xNFJs being some form of psychic masterminds  genuinely capable of reading into your soul  It s a fair pov  as often fictional villains  psychopaths heavily rely on their extraverted feeling  making them capable of manipulating people with ease  geez even healthy ones are often depicted to be flawless in being social chameleons  Well surprise  majority of aux and dom Fe users are not clairvoyants  but rely on that function for decision making on the outside world w  a primary focus on others  which I hope everyone can agree clearly describes Izuku  Honestly it s no use to even pretend that his Fe is undeveloped  for developing strategies  plans he relies on Ni  being guided by his Fe principles   Overall  I would say his character was very well written  with his own set of limitations  but still be as aspiring as ever,infj
Hardcore Ni abuser  No really  I thought I used my Ni too much before seeing him  Is there any other fictional character that uses it as much  I don t think I have seen another one  His Fe is also quite strong  No other possibility than INFJ fits ,infj
Ok  I can see the INFJ here clearly  but I also understand why some people say he s INFP  But isn t he a lawful good  The heros in the story work for the government  or am I wrong  That he goes after his heart in some situations here and there  doesn t mean he isn t lawful ,infj
I always saw Deku as          goal oriented      overly analytical      competitive  I may be wrong  I would love to hear an argument why Deku is     ,infj

I think he s INFP   FiNe   highly individualistic  strong sense of authenticity   very idealistic  He s probably mistyped as INFJ because of a prominent Enneagram   fix   which correlates to Fe   altruism ,infj
The way Midoriya plans  especially during action  is very Ni  And that s very prominent from the beginning    Someone else mentioned this as well  but when Deku grabbed that junk of metal during the race and then used the land mines as a means of getting ahead was all a hunch    I don t think a Ne aux person would be like  ah yes  a huge a s s piece of metal that ll POSSIBLY slow me down more than aid me  I might not even need to use it at all  but you know  I ll take it     That decision is pure Ni  That would be up to argument if the characters new before hand that there would be a mined land  but they didn t   The same can be said about his Ti  He uses that damn thing all the time while planning alongside Ni ,infj
INFP because he cries  Nah  that s just his quirk ,infj
     This will not be a thread I consistently add on to  Check back for more  this is gonna take a while    Inherently  the INFP votes are respectable  Fi is about intrapersonal values and emotions  And while Midoriya definitely has strong values and motives tied to his own moral preferences  the way he goes about building himself as a person and as a hero is largely dependent on those around him and adapting himself to external factors  and the way he originally took on his path as a hero was lacking in individuality and immediately took to emulation  which seems lacking in Fi s more independent mentality  When that didn t work so effectively for him  he learned to individualize his style while also referring to those around him to see what would be most effective  using his interpersonal observations to create a better methodology and approach   An example of Midoriya s Ni being put to work was when he used those land mines to launch himself during the obstacle race during the Sports Festival Arc  When he made that strategy  it wasn t necessarily that he saw that out of many possibilities  it was more of a sudden intuitive revelation  Ni  between his range of capabilities and the world around him  Se  in a time of urgency   The way the INFP voters are describing Te is way more fluid than inferior functions are   s comment is probably the best explanation for Te inferior out of the INFP voters  However  when it comes to other justifications  they tie back Midoriya s Te to his planning which he does very consistently  so I find it difficult to see this as an inferior function behavior  As for a response to killuwater s justification  I see that as being more of a high idealistic way of his Ni being focused on his future  possibly due to more immature use of his Ti in correlation with his actual range of capabilities based on an unproven theory he has about how far he could go ,infj
Lmao  I like how the arguments on the coments are like  INFP   actually well structureted arguments and examples of the use of the functions    INFJ   wtf is wrong with INFP votes  I mean is obviously he is INFJ they don t give any reasons ,infj
I m voting INFP  I had in my mind that he was an INFJ but Mario Kart champion s points  go to the comments below  make me think about him as an INFP  for now   Edit  I rewatched the anime  obvious Fe Ti axis  srry guys    ,infj
Fe dominant  he thinks all the time about protecting others and he wants to become the symbol of peace  for Ni I don t think I need to argue lol,infj
Not surprised to see INFP votes but this boy have the most obvious Ni dom,infj
Weird INFJ  He definitely has that Ni Fe delusional messiah complex and that is his core  Also a nerd with a life long unrealistic goal and strategic moments indicating strong Ni   But at the same he shows too many weirdly enthusiastic or anxious moments like Fi dom or Fe dom  INFJs are usually much laid back then that and their anxiety is less louder due to balanced Fe Ti with dreamy Ni  thus shown as wise old sages ,infj
 Copied from one of the comments I made in a thread  slightly edited   We re not saying that non Se users can t fight  we re saying that the way Midoriya fights is Ni Se in a way that signals Se is in his primary four functions   When Midoriya is fighting  he quickly adapts and readjusts to his surroundings and opponent  trying to get a good read on his opponent while following through with the plans he makes quickly as he s forced to reconfigure his methods  And we only really see him falling back onto this Se thought process when he s stressed  and it can cause him to become quite reactive to his surroundings   A good example of Midoriya s function stack getting involved in a time under stress was in his battle with Shinsou at the Sports Festival  We see him going into a place of deep thinking to attempt to gather his thoughts  Ti   When Ojiro gave Midoriya insight into Shinsou s quirk  he was able to create a more holistic thought process of what to do  Ni Ti   Midoriya tends to chameleon into his environment and go about dealing with people around him with a more individualized reasoning style  signaling Fe Ti   Fi Te  but in a time of stress  he became reactive  Se   which he does more than once throughout the series   Another notable time was when he ran in to attempt to save Bakugou from the slime villain   That whole part of his character is basically just his Se inferior activating  to me ,infj
INFP biens r  vous croyez vraiment qu un INFJ pourrait avoir un tel FANATISME pour un personne c l bre comme  a  c est purement du Fi dom ,infj
I don t see any Fe  Uraraka is a better example of Fe than him  in my opinion  Fe in an INFJ would be someone who is prone to change his behavior values in certain spaces for the sake of not having any confrontation  as an example    It s not necessarily being sentitive to others feelings  but    rather  wanting to part of a group  and for that  proceeding to trying to understand the individuals of it while adapting  it s not always empathy   That s how it usually works on INFJ s  and the reason why they can be hard to spot  too  since we blend in   But Midoriya constantly gets involved in situations where he can t ignored his feelings  saving Bakugo  Eri  Kota  Iida  without caring that much about others opinions  like teachers or authority  or even the person that he is saving   Uraraka shows more Fe when she decided not to go on the mission to save Bakugo because Bakugo probably didn t wanted to be saved  unlike him    In his case  that understanding of others  feeling would be more Ni  his intuition telling him how others feel  even if it isn t accurate     He guides himself by his values and does what he thinks is the right thing to do  which manifest on helping others  The conversation with Endeavor at the Sports Festival is a great example of this  and the way he understands things  like All Might telling him that he can t save everyone so he smiles instead  something that he took as him having to be better instead of accepting  I can t save everyone   That s more Fi to me   I think that Ni Fi Fi Ni is very high on him  But I m not sure about his type yet  so I ll probably study his character later  hmm   Maybe the functions just aren t enough ,infj
I don t understand people who voted INFP  Please focus on how the functions are stacked  Thinking is obviously not at the bottom  He obviously also has a very strong intuition  V e r y  S t r o n g ,infj
I firmly believe Izuku is an INFP   Fi dom   his dream to be a super hero no matter what  not afraid of the judgement of others and what the society will think of a super hero without powers    not Fe auxiliary   Very sensitive  high sense of morals and values  The will to help others isn t necessarily Fe  it can also be Fi  that s why a lot of you guys are probably wrong  Ne aux   establishes plans and crazy ideas to win during battles or to succeed challenges  baseball at yuei  battle against bakugo  against villains in the boat at the SCA   He overthinks a lot  Si   His note  He can be factual and pay attention to his experience  Learns from what he sees  Te inf   Even without quirk  he still wants to be a hero  Doesn t give in to logic  His actions are often guided by his feelings or a spontaneity  he hurts himself with his quirk and doesn t think about the consequences ,infj
I don t think he is an Ni user   His way of learning is very Si Ti  his over thinking nature is very Si Ti too cuz it s very precise and worried about posibilities  Ne inferior  When he was young he wrote lot of note books about all heroes power and how they use them to memorize them in his personal database  Si Ti    So he can use them in various ways when he become a hero  Ti Ne   i think whats makes him smart is that he is very knowledgable and have a great database from heroes experiences and he have a quite developed Ne cuz of that  that was shown is his creative ways of creating solutions   He is very Fe and just want to  save people with a smile   EDIT  sorry INFJs who downvoted this   I didn t meant to hurt ur fragile sense of identity cuz u all thought he is an also an INFJ  i will consider ur arguments tho  or else u will just look so desperate to self insert as a main character maybe   Or is it a an intuitive bias  ,infj
For those of you that still think bakugou s an ENTJ  pay attention to how he reacts to deku s Ne brainstorms  ,infj
Midoriya likes planning  w   and has a goal in mind  which is usually associated with INFJs since INFPs usually just have a rough idea of what they wanna achieve or do  But his goal is his motivation and he doesn t really have a clear way to achieve it  he doesn t really plan out how he s going to reach that goal and rather just learns take up things along the way to his goal  IMO  he seems to use Ne a lot more than Ni  He tends to think about many different possibilities reasons to situations but rarely forms a conclusion quickly  He s in tune with how others feel but especially of how he feels to any given situation  I see Fi because he does things mainly based on his own personal values which he rarely questions ,infj
why         or phlegmatic dominant phlegmatic melancholic  genuine question  i m trying to figure it out myself,infj
hmm   can someone explain  w  to me  i thought  w  would suit him a bit more,infj
his sp blindspot is directly linked to his selflessness  and how he will sacrifice himself for others  his fe plays a role in this too ,infj
Why EII instead of IEI ,infj
someone wanna explain  nd SX ,infj
Deku is a character I relate to A LOT  so I guess I always wanted him to be INFP  However  having learned more about the functions  I think he probably is Ni Fe  with solidly developing Ti and Se  He also reminds me a LOT of Armin ,infj
People are saying crying doesn t mean anything     it really does  My INFJ sisters can t relate to him at all  while I m an INFP and I do    They think he cries way too much  and they hardly ever cry    infact a lot of the time they don t even know how they feel and they usually have to talk it out with Fe    I m not saying INFJs can t cry but Yes  crying is very much an fi thing  and while they can tell how other are feeling  they usually push their Se too far and then only realise they were hurt    like a switch   I feel like there are a lot of INFPs who think they are INFJs  and relating to deku and typing him INFJ  INFJ is a rare type  My INFJ sisters don t even come on things like this site to argue cus theyre leading with Ni and don t focus on stuff like this    Planning isn t an argument either  INFPs inferior is Te so they actually plan a lot  After planning  their Ne then thinks of all the possibilities  Ni doesn t  while also using past memories  Si  ,infj
Very strong Fe  but not overpowering his Ni  His Ti is off the CHARTS though ,infj
INFP  Se blind  I would even argue ENFJ but so not INFP ,infj
I think he s more of a type   than a    ,infj
                                                                                                                                                                                         ,infj
I d argue INTP is a closer second guess than INFP considering the sheer amount of Ti analysis he displays,infj
 w   w  imo  but what do you guys and gals think ,infj
Throughout the anime he shows INFJs dominant function Ni  He literally keeps a notebook of all heroes and their powers  That is like a physical representation of Ni and its web like thinking ,infj
Deku strongly believes in helping people  which can definitely be interpreted as Fi having strong people centric values or Fe naturally being attuned to the emotions of other people  When Fi s values are similar to Fe s universal ethics  it can be hard to discern between Fe and Fi  The same type of Fe Fi discussion is happening on Uraraka s page lol  I personally interpret his emotions and interactions as Fe fueled  but I can absolutely see where the INFP votes are coming from ,infj
the fact that he provoked todoroki just so todoroki would use both of his powers in this one fight od them both and therefore midoriya risking himself to loose is just so INFJ like and so wholesome ,infj
 LONG POST         By popular demand  popular as in   upvotes so far lol   I will present some arguments about Fe vs Fi that do not rely on stereotypes  taken from comments I ve made on a post below   Midoriya states multiple times that he feels the expectations and burdens of becoming a hero for others  and that awareness and acceptance of his role and values of the people around him is what defines him as a Fe user  He is more than willing to try to live up to these external expectations  whereas a Fi user would not be as aware of nor be as comfortable trying to fit into expectations defined by others  Fe is most likely to initially derive their sense of value from living up to these expectations   Fi users may scan people to gauge their reactions as well  but I would say that high Fe users don t necessarily  scan  people in a conscious way they re more likely to just be naturally hyperaware of others  That s why we can see Midoriya being so empathetic to the point of getting caught up in the suffering of others  tuning into others  emotions first rather than self referencing to try to understand how others feel  what Fi does   There are many more distinct examples of this happening  so I m not gonna list them all but the fight against Todoroki is a prime example  and basically every situation where he s saving someone ,infj
Remember  you can t be an Fi user if you care about other people ,infj
Im confused to how people are shocked that people think he has ne  Its not rocket science that dekus constant overthinking and creativity looks like ne  Ne is interpretive  it can interpret so many possabilitys that it cant settle on one  this is one of the things ne is most well known for and its why people think deku is an INFP because he overthinks everything so much  Im not even saying he has ne but its not exsactly stupid for someone to think he does have it  People keeps saying  deku has ni  He overthinks and hes always in his head   But tbh those are also ne traits    Lol,infj
Clearly a Ni dom  he just changes every situation with his ideas  he overthinks sometimes but only to get to the right conclusion and the most effective ideas  and he freaking cares about people  even risking his own body countless times  he s so selfless  that s a strong Fe for me ,infj
I was the     th vote  nice  I d like to see an INFP argument that extends beyond  he has morals and umm he talks a lot   it really does show that people see  strong opinions   fi  and  thinking erratically   ne ,infj
excellent example of ni dom planning everything he does  he s not INFP because fi is not dominant  an also fe is more seen than fi  ayuYJhAAHHHhh he cries he s INFP i m stupid  also he is not lawful good,infj
I can t believe that people are mistyping him as an INFJ  This is the second mistype I see in BNHA  First Katsuki and now Midoriya   Now I will explain in specific  why this guy is not an INFJ  but an INFP       He has a very strong moral compass and is highly idealistic  Judging by his morality  He never gives up for the sake of his values and morals  which is such a strong sign of Fi        The way he s analyzing is not Ni Ti  It s Ne  Always looking for more possibilities and the  What If s   He speaks his mind out loud and is really dreamy  Also so much random connection pulling up by his head  This is actually quite obvious  guys        Look how he writes the things about the heros in the notebook  So detailed and precise  which is tert Si       Last but not least  The inf Te  which he doesn t show often  but you can see it  when he lose his temper   My conclusion will and stay INFP   And helping other people or support them or anything like that can be any feeler trait  It doesn t just have to be an Fe user  His Ideals is about to be a Hero and that s mostly the main reason to be one  He cares for other people and also cares for their thoughts in some degree  but that doesn t mean he s instantly an INFJ ,infj
Deku is      INTP  INTP s se Ti to make decisions based on logical analysis done over time in their heads  Ti is the reason they prize rationality and objectivity  It also drives their insatiable thirst for knowledge and learning  Because it is their strongest preference  the functions below are said to  serve  the Ti  This just means that the Ti way of doing things gets priority most of the time   Ne is the main way INTP s take in information  It means they use their intuition to find patterns  underlying principles  and ideas  to construct theories and frameworks  and to form connections as they talk  write  or create  It can make them seem quite  rambley  at times as they can jump from topic to topic based on the connections they re making in the moment rather than following a more linear path of conversation  Any of this sound familiar  ,infj
He is very typical INFJ  very good use of Ni Ti and Ni Fe both  his feelings are obviously extroverted  he can t hide it for very long you can see his Fe screaming everywhere  opposite to Todoroki who is Fi user he just seem cold and distant in the starting of many episodes when he was having issues with Fi ,infj
Not an INFP or an ISFJ   Ni  Midoriya is not exactly good at making quick connections and also doesn t tell them to others  He s on his mind  taking time to get to a conclusion cause he deeply analyzes whatever he s thinking about  not with a personal past view  differing from Si   Fe  He wants to be a hero to help people  ever since he first saw All Might save someone  Not because of some inner feeling or moral values  but because he simply wants to be helpful  and feels bad when can t be  When he couldn t save Eri when he first saw her with Chisaki   That s empathy  Fe   not sympathy  Fi    Ti  Curious and nerdy  He wrote lots of journals about heroes and their powers just because he wanted to learn and be like them  NiTi   Ti is also very present in battles when he needs clever ways to fleed or wins his opponent  When first used One for All on his finger to not damage his arm    Se  Usually aware of his surroundings and to what he s looking at  Underdeveloped sense of direction and body mobility  When under pressure in battles  tends to ignore first and third function  focusing on doing whatever it takes to save his friends  Midoriya vs Muscular  ,infj
Quite a lot of people have been typing based on letter dichotomies rather than the Jungian functions  it appears  Midoriya does not have inferior Fe  to the    people who voted INTP and the   that voted ISTP   He definitely has Ni and Ti  Midoriya has Se  but it s definitely apparent that it s not as accessible as any of the other functions  He definitely has that  What will be    mentality of Ni  which is demonstrated consistently as he constantly tries to predict outcomes and notices when something is inconsistent  This is doubled with a value for peace and he possesses awareness for the emotions of others  Izuku is definitely an empath and sees through the emotions that other characters feign  Midoriya demonstrates the information gathering and deconstructing analysis of Ti  It s apparent within the journal of heroes and quirks  it proves just how much effort Midoriya puts into his process of He likes planning and thinking ahead so he s prepared in combat situations  however he utilizes this Se when faced with opponents he doesn t have much experience with by living in the moment and perceiving the situation by everything that s going on and does it with great effectiveness    I can understand ISFJ and INFP arguments  I can see arguments as to why Si is his dominant function or why Midoriya possess Fi instead of Fe  However  his Ni and Ti also can explain quite a few of those Si mannerisms  constant planning based on realistic possibilities  the journal  the stereotypical ISFJ behavior  etc  He fits the description of the INFP  but he is not a Te inferior  If anyone presents a good enough argument  I will take it into consideration  However  if you make an argument for dominant Si you re going to need to present the argument for inferior Ne  as well  Same thing goes for dominant Fi and inferior Te ,infj
Now that spoilers for Ch      came out  somehow it finally registered to me just how sp blind Midoriya is  Like I knew this  but why does it still hit so hard  Perhaps it s because we get to see it from Bakugou s perspective instead   ,infj
He is Fi  he sees things in a values system  this is good and this is bad to do  Midoriya is very empathetic and feels things on other people s level  He wants people to live in a society where they feel safe and secure  Midoriya also tends to dwell on his feelings a lot  Compare him with an obvious Fe user like All Might who doesn t like dealing with his own negative feelings  All Might wants to be accepted by others  he wants to be seen as a hero in the eyes of others  For Midoriya being a hero is a value in himself  he wants to prove himself to others  He spent his time trying to prove to everyone else that doubted him that he can become a hero   Ne  he is always brainstorming on new possibilities  quite scatterbrained  he is everywhere  He always jumps to another thought  In the show he is often seen muttering to himself and thinking   Si  his notes  he writes down everything and takes in bits and pieces of information  when he is fighting  he relates it to past experiences and gets information to how he should approach it  This is obvious when he went to save Bakugo from the Sludge Villain   Te  his Te comes out when he is working through a problem  and he focuses on the logical approach to the situation  Midoriya thinks of the most efficient way to solve it  like when he tried to come up with a plan to help Uraraka win against Bakugo  It also comes out when he lashes back out at Bakugo  saying that Bakugo is wrong about his perceptions of him ,infj
I think this is obvious  tbh   Ni   Constantly planning and observing patterns  Very good at quickly finding conclusions   Fe   Very sensitive to the emotions of others  often his motivations for winning involve the emotions of others  In fact  many of his decisions and motivations are based on the feelings of others ,infj
first of all  how can anyone think midoriya is a Fi user  he s clearly an ISFJ  his Si dom is obvious ,infj
I understand the INFP sentiments  but his planning skills are pretty good he also was able to stick to All Mights training program  He also kept very detailed notes on all the heroes as well which is why I think he s a J ,infj
I don t know why are you people trying to limit the Fi function   he s self sacrificing  he care deeply about others  always makes others happy instead of himself   that can relate to Fe only if it was highly healthy  it s even more relate to Fi  I mean  I know a lot of FPs   FJs  once in school I noticed that my friend ISFP everyday keeps half of her money  so I asked her about this and she said   I watched on news about how does people suffer in a lot of poor countries  that was such hurtful to look at them  so I decided to save money in order to help as much people as I can    tbh I d never do that  I also asked some xSFJ s I know and they disagreed that idea  both can be very good  but the question is how  A Fi can give you his heart if you needed if he really want to   a Fe will wish that you re not going to ask him for that  but if you did  the problem will be that he can t say  NO    he will do even if he don t want to but that doesn t mean that he will never make anything good for it s sake    Fi  I ll help you  because I really want to  Fe  I ll help you  because I just want you to be happy  I want you to like me   yes  Fe wants to be accepted from others  it s EXTERNAL feeling  not internal  failing to realize that every individual must have a completely separate self that is coherent on it s own aside from  social influences    The only thing that I can relate to with Deku is the big plans   dreams  but not the way how he feels  I relate him to all ixfp I know ,infj
People have provided great arguments below  but I wanted to take a step back and look at this from a different perspective  one based in a different typing system created by sortinghatchats  It s quite a well designed system but has some areas of contradiction with identifying specific cognitive functions due to the overlapping nature of some of the sortinghatchats definitions of primaries and secondaries with multiple functions  But  I think the analysis this person provided regarding the value system of Deku in particular is on point and supports Fe over Fi      First off  Midoriya Izuku is a Hufflepuff Primary  There s a difference between  heroes SAVE people  and  heroes save PEOPLE   and Deku s firmly on the latter end of the scale  He wants to help people  specifically  Doesn t matter who   this is the kid who stands up to his admittedly terrifying  former  friend because someone s being bullied  who wants to be a hero because All Might saves people with a smile  and that s what he wants  Not because it s the Right Thing to Do  but because people need saving and that s what he s all about  Ultimately  Deku wants to be a hero because that s how you save people  and he really really really cares about people   cont below ,infj
There s been a lot of good arguments explaining why Deku is INFJ  I don t get it though with the INFP voters  does having a dream and being so emotional really make him him INFP  Why are the standards on the site so high to be co wondered a Ni dom  He cries  he has big dreams  he gets reckless  so he s   Fi  Everything  he does  Is pure Fe  His dreams  are built upon Fe by itself in and out  His foundation and character is Fe  I ve noticed some of just the most emotional characters on this site often get outvoted as INFJs  because they re emotional  They re reckless  Why does being an INFJ require someone type of energy that alludes you to them like Norman from TPN  Or Armin from AOT  Not every INFJ  is the same  Not every Ni dom is going to be the same  They are all fundamentally built different  each with a different concept and ideal in mind that separates their character but their is always going to be something that connects them because of the fact their functions stacks are the same  I ve seen many INFP arguments touching on how emotional and reckless and he is and shoving in definitions of the functions and it works wonders and I don t understand why  Please try to see things from a broader perspective on Deku s type  He comes off like an INFP of course  but he s an INFJ by functions  There s too many arguments for me to just go down the list and critique every single one  And why would I  You took the time to make it  you wanted to get your point across  so go ahead  But I do feel like people should be more open about this  I see very close minded arguments and his INFP votes are at like      now over them  You don t have to be some sage or special character to be an INFJ  let alone an INTJ at that  If they weren t idealized so much  people wouldn t say so often  I can t believe so and so is INxJ     it s not special  You re human  we re human  Let s live and stop having so expectations for everyone and everything  please ,infj
Alright come at me INFJ voters  Open to discussion  Hear me out   I understand the Fe votes because of Deku s self sacrificing nature  But  I see Fi Fe because Deku self sacrifices to meet his Fi ideal to be a hero like All Might  He s not saving others for their sake but to live up to his ideal of what a hero should be  In fact  Deku never compromises his values to please others  Fe   He sucks at Fe  he s horrible at moderating his behaviour to inspire others or faking anything he doesnt feel  Contrast this to Fe users  All Might  Mirio  Hawks  Deku s self image isn t influenced by social pressure  Eg  despite years of bullying and being told he can t be a hero  he still clings to that Fi dream   He stubbornly denies inferior Te  believing irrationally despite the evidence that quirkless ppl can t be heros   his idealistic view of Bakugo is another despite the evidence of his bullying   But he s still stressed by Te because he doesn t know how he will accomplish his dream   Part   in reply  why he s Si Ni and NOT Ti  ,infj
Why are there so many INFP votes  Deku is not an emotional wreck  Just because he s an FI dom doesn t mean he s an         like bakugo  It just means he s VERY good at judging situations and coming up with tactics and strategies to help people ,infj
 When  Midoriya s  heart is set on something  there s no stopping him     Tenya Iida  I m a bit confused by the overwhelming consensus of INFJ  It makes me wonder if I m missing something  because as an Fi dom myself  I see so much Fi in him   I see a lot of people say that because Midoriya is ambitious and analytical that he must be Ni dom  but these aren t traits that are exclusive to INxJs at all  As an INFP  I m very analytical when it comes to the things I m passionate about  and the same is true for Midoriya  Also  I think having that lifelong dream of being a hero actually points to Fi rather than Ni  because Ni is a perceiving function  not a judging function  and therefore I don t see it as the driver behind why he wants the things he does  To figure out his  driver   you have to look at his feeling function  WHY does he want to be a hero  Because that s the type of person he IS  Authenticity  Fi   A lot of people seem to latch onto Fe as his aux because he s compassionate and wants to help people  but again  these traits are not exclusive to Fe  From my perspective  the relevant difference between Fi and Fe is whether one s morals come from a place of individualism  Fi  or consensus  Fe   Whether these morals are firm  Fi  or flexible  Fe   And like the quote I pulled from Iida says  Midoriya s morals are very  very firm  He knows in his heart the right thing to do in pretty much every situation  and he does not bend from that ever    Since I m in the minority on this  I m definitely open to other points of view  I can definitely see why people would type him as an Fe type  for instance  I just see that more as him VALUING things like compassion  heroism  etc   and other things coming into play like his Enneagram  tri type  instinctual variants  etc   EDIT  After thinking about it more  I m going to temporarily retract my MBTI typing since I m not fully comfortable labeling him as either INFP or INFJ  I can see strong arguments for both ,infj
A very good example of INFJ  Amazing at understanding other people s feelings and helping others get through their problems  For example  when he helped Todoroki use his left side making todoroki realize its his powers  not his fathers ,infj
INFP for sure    Deku leads with his Fi  which is a decision making function all about morals etc so dekus dream of saving people with a smile   all Fi    His parent is a Ne and for those who don t know the difference between Ne and Ni    Ni is pretty driven and can just kinda tell what s gonna happen while Ne is looking for all possibilities and timelines etc   Knowing this  you ll deffo see deku using his Ne in a fight which means he tends to think too much and he can be slow in decision making because he s thinking of all the possibilities which even bakugou points out    You also see his Ne in the way he s scared he won t be able to reach his dreams cus he s dwelling on the negative possibilities of failing which is very Ne and so with his inferior Te  he constantly looks for approval from others and their opinions    He has Si child and for those who don t know the difference   Se sees everything around them and takes it all in while Si stores information and recalls it when needed  Deku is deffo Si because he s always writing stuff and taking in info to use in future battles  Si users tend to dwell on memories a lot and endure a lot  not to be confused while INFJs Ni willpower  while Se tends to focus more on the here and now    His inferior is Te  Te is a go getter kind of function but when it s the inferior  it tends to dwell on what other people think of them  extroverted thinking  and if it s too insecure INFPs let it get in the way of certain things ,infj
Why is he enneagram   and not       or  ,infj
His Ti is really good  The guy is the proof that INFJs can be op ,infj
 Idealist so Fi  Bruh he only looks like a perceiver due to being a   Lastly INFJs have Te PoLR Trickster and are even more Idealistic   I ll be honest though NEVER has there ever been a Tactical Ni dom ,infj
 kinda off topic  Just came to realize  as if by epiphany  that OFA is a Fe ability by essence and could only be properly used by a Fe user  I e  a Fe dom or aux    in literal contrast with AFO  a naturally anima inf Fi ability    since  mild spoiler  ahead in the replies ,infj
The least cynical INFJ I ve seen  ,infj
High Fe user regardless  Awkward goofball  half shy  half unable to say what he s thinking  In a pinch  he ll Ni Ti plans to defeat the opponent  whereas in a more natural state he s constantly aware of Fe  He s had the same tunnel visioned dream since he was a child and never let that dream go  he realized it through any means necessary   Impossible  is not in the vocabulary of an INxJ,infj
where is fi in him what,infj
I see why people consider him INFP  but here s the thing  if he was in fact a Fi dom  he wouldn t be so goal oriented   note that INFPs are Fi Ne  which is generally broader than Ni Fe when it comes to capture the whole idea  because Ne isn t so concerned in hidden prospections  that s why extroverted     with his classic in depth analysis   which tends to overthinking when he s anxious  pretty commom across INFJs  they are also tunned emotionally but they tend to need a certain amount of  recharge  time to process feelings and its future implications    thus ni fe   and being able to mimic  improve and spot patterns and develop them  I m not saying Fi doms don t do that  but it s natural to say why he s a Ni dom with impeccably good developed Fe  His Fi is in fact more suitable to a senex version  we see he is hard with his own feelings because he s insecure of not corresponding to other people s expectations   so he censures these feelings   but is able to connect greatly with others  Fe aux  ,infj
Tritype of     or       ,infj
To the people that says  There s no Ni  let me just say  Those with Ni as their dominant function prefer to focus on the future  They are adept at analyzing the past  but they only do so when looking for clues to the future  Izuku s analysis  on heroes  but also on his friends  life experiences  and basically everything  and his general behavior  is completely based in what he wants to accomplish  hes goal oriented  future oriented  They are driven to see the big picture and to understand how things work down at a fundamental  root cause level  They love theories  concepts  and complex systems  They tend to be strategic   You really are telling me he doesn t constantly does shows this on his internal monologue  And especially  you re really telling me he s not strategic  He s very good at improvising but he is also very good at planning and he does it often  You can see this  for example  when they rescue Bakugo  The plan to do so  so they don t get in that way of the heroes and also they make sure Bakugo will accept the help  thats strategic  And in general if you look up being strategic  it says it is  being perceptive  future oriented  open minded  proactive  working off the front foot  and making and taking decisions based on evidence and calculated hunches  that s exactly how he acts  how he confront every situation Those with Ni as their dominant function are good at spotting trends and patterns  They can easily connect the dots  Tell them what actions you have been taking and they will tell you what the future implications are for you   You can see this in his fights and training exercises  in the way he finds Stain too  and even in how he learned to use his quirk  It s all about patterns  connecting dots  and noticing previous actions and using it to know the future outcomes for others  situations and himselfI think you can see his Ni in almost all his behaviors  I truly don t know how you dont see it ,infj
everyone literally everyone in comment section  HE S Ni DOM CUS HE FOCUSED ON GOAL WHICH IS BEING A HERO AND HES FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE     HE ALSO LIKES HELPING OTHERS SO HE S A FEELER    Did everyone forget what Ni is  Jesus lord save my     ,infj
Hes not a lawful good  He doesn t care about rules as much as doing the right thing for people  He constantly goes against rules  in a matter of facts  to keep protecting others  He s reckless like that  As long as it s to keep people safe and doing the good thing he s willing to do anything  even if it goes against what he s told he  has  to do  He s a neutral good ,infj
INFJ yet no Ni HAHAHA,infj
I see INFP is gaining popularity  but by dichotomy and generally how the Pi functions tend to work  I think Deku is most clearly IxFJ  If you re arguing he s guided more by feelings and that his logic is a piece of crap  which it is   your sentiment would go further with ENFJ  which I ve actually been considering for him  he seems pretty close on the dichotomy lines I vs E wise there and he really dumps the ball with Ti sometimes  though I still think it s likely not inferior   Deku as a character is highly planned in both his fighting style and life  His weak point is that when he tries to work on his feet  he gets overly impulsive and erratic  which before he gained control over his quirk resulted in permanent injury  He s so calculating as a character and inept with working in new scenarios that he has not taken any personal notes on or villains who have tactics not comparable to people he has faught before  which is a little anti Ne  Low Pi  Ni Si  involves have a weakness for understanding the consequences of their actions and planning  or at least that plans will be made flexible rather than clear and structured   neither of which he has an issue with  Even when he s breaking his bones  he knows exactly what he s doing and even tailors the fallout for his battles  ie  consider at the sports festival his fight with Todoroki  He immediately knows how many attacks he can get on Shoto and uses his fingers to maximize those attacks    And also doesn t consider any other possibilities of actions I d note   And for Ni  up until he contacts all might  he is fixated on some hyper delusional dream of becoming a hero without a quirk  which is completely separated from reality  low Se and Ti  because it s not based on a misjudgment of tangible data  Te   but based upon the fact that he  through his own personal logic  decides that despite there being no other heros out there that are quirkless  he can totally do it  which is low misused Ti  ,infj
Lol  Deku s such a loser he s a  w  protagonist and wasn t included on  w  day ,infj
I ve only started the series but after a few episodes  he looks very INFJ      Obsessed with his goal  Ni     very analytical as demonstrated with his note taking  Ti     extremely strong personal morales  Fi   so xFxP or IxFJ   INFJ s second strongest function in socionics  so can easily line up with an INFJ typing which is what Ni and Ti suggest     does not use to humour to deflate conflict but instead becomes quiet and hopes to be ignored  INFJ response as opposed to INFP in my experience     idealistic and seemingly unrealistic with plans  strong Ni  Ne  Fi and Fe     Has the vibe of IxFJ  I don t see an argument for INFP so far  perhaps he changes over the series,infj
Definitely seems to be an INFJ early in the series  I m not super involved with the series to make a definitive argument for either  I think people are basing his functions based off of how he acts in very specific and plot important  a k a  high stress  moments as opposed to how he acts casually and with his friends to determine his stack  Around his friends  he DEFINITELY acts like an aux Fe user  and the way he writes notes about different heros in notebooks and his analysis of them is pure tertiary Ti  Don t interpret this as projecting because there is little I find similar to me in his character  which is probably due to his enneagram    Tl dr  I think it s important to analyze his cognitive functions within the context of the scenes he is in  For INFJs you re more likely to see Ni and Fe used in relaxed situations  and Ne and Fi in stressful situations ,infj
Ignoring the sentiments of others in favor of your own strong sentiments is pure Fi  Fe would ve been much more likely to conform his sentiments to those excepted by society  Fi is a lot more defiant  and that s clearly seen in deku s thought process when anyone questions his dreams  He also seems unreceptive to the logic reasoning of others  an issue an INFJs Ti would be unlikely to have  Putting the feelings of others before your own isn t just an Fe thing  Deku just does that out of his own ideals  and overall feeling like a        person if he doesn t follow them ,infj
Deciding to follow dreams no matter what is more indicative of Fi  because it is a conviction  not the dream itself  Perception functions merely provide information  Judgement functions make decisions   While Midoriya is an idealist  this is the exact reason why he is Fi  not Fe  Valuing feeling over logic  and valuing the ideal and the romantic above all else are all in line with being an INFP  not an INFJ  Midoriya is all about remaining true to himself and his ideals and not wavering no matter what anyone says or thinks which is anti Fe   If Midoriya valued logic  he would have realized that it was impossible for him to be a hero  He s smart and strategic  but I don t necessarily see him  valuing logic  in a Ti sense  Besides  those without Ti are fully capable of being logical ,infj
Fi   I m sorry  Kacchon  but this is just who I am     That s right  Don t worry about what other people think  Hold your head up high and plunge forward     Sometimes I do feel like I m a failure  Like there s no hope for me  But even so  I m not gonna give up  Ever    Midoriya is the epitome of an Fi dominant  He is highly idealist  and determines to follow his dreams no matter  even when it appears hopeless  Having no quirk  most people would have given up on the idea and moved on  but Midoriya refused to  He is guided solely by his ideals and values  allowing them to dictate his actions  He is also quick to proclaim his ideals to those around him  which early on results in him being bullied frequently  However  he continues to proclaim his dreams in spite of the detrimental results  Down the road  his tenacity ends up inspiring others  Midoriya is incredibly hard on himself when he fails to live up to his high personal standards  Midoriya also idealizes his heroes to fault  which is an Fi tendency  He is warned over and over again throughout the show that his weakness is seeing All Might as a god  However  it takes him a while to understand why that is a bad thing  Midoriya is also very dramatic and frequently shown crying whenever the moment is the slightest bit emotional  All Might mocks him for this to some degree  Continue   ,infj
His imaginative solutions for troubles are screaming for Ne  He has his very own morals of good and bad and he fights for them  he would never step back  Fi dom His memory of facts   Like he remember every single quirk and detail about heroes    This is tert Si INFP for me   ,infj
The best argument for him being INFJ imo is tertiary Ti  I think INFP with developed Te makes more sense ,infj
Fi Ne   Ni Fe constitutes for Si and idolising inferior Te,infj
I can t see him without Ni dom  it s literally the character s aura   I understand who sees a grip of Fi  but i also can t see him without Fe aux  He never imposed anything on Katsuki based on his own morals  but he always tried to use his friend s visions to deal with the problem between them  He cannot face others in general  he just wants to keep the peace established and his friends close     i m still learning about MBTI so i can be totally wrong about this ,infj
I logged in just so I could post this  I genuinely think he s an INFP  I can see how he looks like a Fe user  as his goal is to save others  but I think he s more of a Fi user  He has a very strong moral code  a desire to help others because it s what he believes in  Also  he s definitely a Ne user  too    I can clearly see the Ne and the Te because he is fantastic at making connections and seeing patterns  Ne   and has precise  agile decision making  which indicates a good use of inferior Te  I simply cannot see the Ni Ti     Besides  he clearly falls under the Fi Si loop  He often overthinks things he did in the past  like not being able to rescue someone or making a mistake in a fight  He s just a very healthy INFP  except for the FiSi loop   because he has a great use of FiNe  as well as being able to use his inferior function very well  And most importantly  he overcame the procrastination aspect of the INFP   lol    Seriously  there is not a doubt in my heart that Midoriya is an INFP  I can somewhat see ISFP  but Fi dom for  sure  ,infj
come on guys he s clearly a Se dom  he fights    he has Fi because he s a shounen protagonist                  ,infj
Seems more INFP than INFJ   Im seeing more ne   ,infj
That Ni Ti loop though,infj
He seems very Fi to me  I never noticed any preference for Fe,infj
He s a born turbulent advocate  INFJ T   While doing everything he can get to do  he almost every time forgets about himself  When cornered  the situation leads him to do everything he can  even in an unhealthy  utterly risky way  The world is born for them to spread love  equality  and soften the heart of those toward hatred  His mannerisms are quite soft yet energetic  always prompt  ready to help those towards him  despite his insecurities and worries  He s born with a strong sense of justice and right  He believes that he can do something to change the society  even the world itself  minimally speaking  Despite all that said  he also needs his own time to process  which is commonly spent when he s in the hospital or after some reckless act to save someone  he needs to take that time to keep moving himself towards his insecurities  because he feels the others need his help  That s pretty much of it ,infj
i always saw a lot of ne in him but that might just be me,infj
Please keep in mind he is a fictional character  which implies loads of inconsistencies  writers clearly don t have cognitive functions in mind  However  by weighing out the possibilities  I can t make any sense why he is typed as INFJ by a large majority here     He reeks Fi in every aspect  Remember the provisional license exam  Once he saw the injured kid  he said something about the situation being bad  Someone who values and is conscious of Fe is wayyy less likely to do so  They would regard the feelings of others around them before their own when that presented such a scenario so suddenly  Someone with a good example of Fe would be clearly All might and maybe even Mirio  It was implied Mirio was unconscious towards his own feelings  which is very common for users with Fe as their first function  it is strong in the unconscious psyche  Since he inspired by All Might so greatly  it s natural for him to try to embody these Fe traits  But ultimately  the source of his determination to be the  best hero  so that nobody will worry about me   deku  Fi  as compared to  a symbol of peace  to help people in dark times   All Might  Fe   By leading with Fi  it means that he is aware of his emotions all of the same   D in socionics  which is displayed pretty clearly throughout the series  him having that super firm resolute to be the best hero comes from an internal deciding function  Fi  This does not mean he has zero Fe  during his heroic moments  he does know what to say exactly to cheer up and comfort the victims  going by socionics if he leads with Fi  he would have  D Fe  The higher the dimensionality  the stronger it is  Going by the evidence throughout the series Fi   Fe,infj
For me he is clearly a user of Si and Fe    ,infj
This dude is not an INFJ  First and foremost  he doesn t lead with Ni and Fe  INFJ s look towards how people are feeling reacting to make sense of their hunches  Because of this they mirror and are constantly gauging if their actions are appropriate to the current situation  Hence the INFJ  mask   Deku wears his emotions on his sleeve and is incredibly self aware of his own feelings  Second  he has emotional outbursts that are prolonged and indisputable  He does not understand other people but is very aware of his own feelings and motivations Strong Fi   INFJ desperately want harmony  to the point of often neglecting their own emotions  While they deeply understand other people    As an example  His entire altercation with Gentle Criminal shows exactly how oblivious to others he is  Instead of taking or even considering for a moment  both sides he hyper focused on his own desire to be a hero for Eri  Completely ignoring the parallel between Eri and him and GC and La Brava  There was no harmony  no empathy or consideration of how the fight was affecting La Brava  Even though it was happening right in front of him ,infj
This may sound weird but I think Deku has a stoic kind of philosophy to him  He s always in the worst situations but no matter what tries to do the best he can to make a better future when he knows that there are some things out of his control  Even when he didn t have powers he still tried to do the best he could with saving Kacchan and analyzing superheroes  It s really cool to see that  or I may just be overthinking it ,infj
Fi Hero can be very serious  it s just about judging things as  good evil  rather than  true false   And Deku doesn t fall for group ethics like an INFJ would  He stands for his beliefs  That s IxFP  As for the Percieving axis  well  he s rather abstract  Ne Parent  and has a innocently strong sense of duty and loyalty  Si Child   INFP ,infj
The biggest thing that screams INFJ is his determination  and trying to be someone else like all might instead of himself in the beginning  INFJs tend to reflect themselves on those they look up to or want to be or like or    well everyone they are around really ,infj
I m gonna reiterate  Horribly written INFP that tries to appeal to appeal to the author s ENFJ fetish  Given his prior character  it makes zero sense for him to have the Se confidence he develops later in the series   he just has to  because he becomes  the World s Greatest Hero    Trash   EDIT  Okay  I typed him ENFJ  Now stop hurting my fellings guys ,infj
It s refreshing to see a shounen protagonist who isn t an ExFP  one of the reasons BNHA differs from other shounen  He s also one of the most evident EII in anime I ve seen so far,infj
Where do you see Se inf in him ,infj
Probably the most  w  character I ve ever seen ,infj
INFJ  w  beta Quadra,infj
His whole life he had a plan to be a hero and didn t let anything stop him  he just tunnel vision went after his goal   you know what would have happened if he were a Si dom and found out he s quirkless and everyone bullied him and kept telling him he can t be a hero because thats just how it works in the society  He d give up and choose a more realistic goal    The entire point of his idealistic a ss is his goddamn Ni and how he ll never give up until he reaches his goal no matter what happens   Also yeah  like some others said here before me  he uses his inferior Se in desperate situations when there s no time to plan things  he just jumps into action immediately,infj
At first I thought he was an INFP but the more I read about his cognitive functions the more I realize he s definitely an INFJ,infj
He seems more INFP to me   He acts rashly at times  very emotional,infj
ISFJ he mainly uses his Si to solve problems ,infj
Noticing patterns easily  always focusing in the real experience  His strategies are all based in the knowledge he noticed and wrote on his note  that s the dominant Si ,infj
EDIT  I removed any arguments using the eight function stack model and polished my analysis for the time being  It s still a bit disorganized  but I m more happy with this updated version   Deku is an INFJ  From the very beginning  Deku demonstrates Dominant Ni in how he idolizes All Might and he envisions himself to be a great hero just like him  While many people idolize All Might  I would argue that Deku places him on a pedestal much higher than the average person  Idealization is more common among higher intuition in the function stack  He also idealizes Bakugo and eventually Deku doesn t just view him and All Might as symbols of aspiration  but rather goals that he wishes to surpass one day  Ni    Dominant Ni is known to have tunnel vision tendencies depending on how set an INxJ is on pursuing an ideal  a notion that hits home for Deku  Early on in the story  when Deku faces the harsh truth that he cannot achieve his dream due to not having a quirk he is devastated  Other examples of Deku using Ni is that he is able to see things that lie beneath the surface that others cannot  For example  Deku notices that Todoroki has personal issues   Lost amid the cheers that arose from the audience    I saw Todoroki defrost his own frozen self with his left hand  And to me    Something about him seemed really sad      More in reply ,infj
where are the ISFJ votes suddenly coming from ,infj
 w  so sx  tritype  w   w   w      He has a hyperactive mind  always troubleshooting  analyzing his environment  evaluating people situations  hypervigilant  pinpointing weaknesses and strengths and striving to improve himself   s have a tendency to be inert and self forgetting in order to remain calm and peaceful  that s not his case at all  He s reactive  always has some level of anxiety and is extremely detailed and meticulous in everything he does     Although he dislikes it  he doesn t actively avoid conflict and instead runs straight into it and stands his ground in a shakily counterphobic way  We ve also seen several times that he can be very competitive     He s extremely dependent on his external support system  His Quirk notebooks are to get inspiration from others  he morally relies on his friends  mother and especially All Might  and his biggest fear is not being able to do anything on his own  He imitates others not out of a lack of creativity but because he lacks confidence in his own abilities     His character can best be summarized as self critical  self conscious  insecure and shameful  but also very analytical  inquisitive  dutiful  responsible for his self improvement and things people outside himself  and vigilant  He seems  ish at times because integration to   causes  s to become more relaxed and optimistic  but that s not his default state         coward who hides behind others and can t do anything on their own   Actual INFJ  w   Lady Tamayo  Trunks  Remus Lupin ,infj
His character isn t very consistently written but then again he is the protagonist so he s bound to be changing a lot as a part of his character development,infj
Are people here afraid to vote SJs on characters they like   Everyone agrees on Ne and Si here but they re too scared to cross the SJ line lmao,infj
Can someone Explain why they think  w  ,infj
Stop calling cute characters INFP  Midoriya is always making plans thinking about all the possibilities to find the best answer  he is always focused on the way  it can t be more Ni dom  And Fi dom  Really  Deku shows Fe over Fi  The harmony is more important than his principals  he has good social skills and knows how to persuade someone  typical Fe user ,infj
Could be  w  but I think he is more of a  w  guy,infj
Fi  Deku has a habit of blaming himself for things because his feelings are turned on him  An Fe tends to blame others because their feelings are toward the external environment  Besides  Deku wants to be a hero because he likes the idea of being a hero  it s a subjective feeling of his  He is not like All Migth who is a hero because he has a desire to protect everyone  And lastly  Tall Fe often let themselves be affected by people s opinions  but Deku continued to believe that he could be a hero  even when everyone said otherwise    Ne  Midoriya verbalizes his ideas  thinking of various possibilities and then narrows them down  The weird habit of talking to yourself is your Ne externalizing ideas  In addition  he ALWAYS expresses his thoughts to others quickly    Te  He has a hard time following plans  as when he messes with the All Migth training plan  Your Te tells him he can t be a hero  but his Fi makes him hold the belief that even without individuality this is possible ,infj
Izuku    is not a very consistently written character   One moment he s this clumsy highschool kid that s easily flustered and overly expressive about his personal ideals and beliefs  INFP   the next moment he s a battle master tactician with more capability with Se than an INFP should ever have  Se is Point of Least Resistance for INFPs EIIs in Socionics    Fi   Stereotypical Japanese ethicist  Concern is about living up to his personal beliefs and values about heroism first and it s impact on the people second  ENFJ All Might is the other way around   Not very good at the controlling Fe communication and overreacts very easily  Is humanitarian because his beliefs demand it   Ne   Very whimsical with wild dreams and ambitions   however doesn t have any plans with steps  vision  like an Ni Se user  Fancies heroism because of Fi Te self improvement values   Si   Can recall a great deal of internalized sensory information on the spot  Keeps well detailed notes of many heroes as a hobby  no details organized into serialized plan like Ni Se  Ni Se also wouldn t waste time with trivial sensory information that doesn t orient itself towards a goal    Te   Te  with Si  allows Midoriya to collect vast amounts of logical facts which are mostly trivial  however  he tends to let his personal feelings overrule logic  He saves Bakugo because he believes it s the right thing but forgets he is incapable  at that time quirkless  of beating villains ,infj
ignorance about how Dom Si actually works stills going on     Si and Ni   Both recall data  Both learn from past Differences  Si Dom enjoys schedules  endless stamina  just like a worker ant   obsessed with a hands on action or observable data with a subjetive significate for themselves  will do its best to preserve things as they are with no change  no matter what   Ni Dom foresees the most likely future according to recalled past  tracks and can sinthetize information  obsessed with a Future landscape or  Dream   guru like prediction  can create guesses out of nowhere and figure how things will play out easily  Si   a Soldier Ni   a detective  that is ,infj
I put INFP because    he acts a loottt like me and    He is very emotional and he basically makes all his decisions with his heart which is a classic for INFP personalities,infj
Can anyone give out Ni example   I had been trying to figure out why and how some people see him as Ni user and it come out as none   Ni   your valuation of tendency towards internal original free association and creativity   Si   your valuation of  focus on internal sensations and reliving past moments    Him wanting to be like All Might is Ni    He idolize  want to be exactly like  costume based on  follow All Might pattern    He had problem making OFA his own because in mind it AM s quirk  not him   Si     He is like Armin  therefore Ni user   Armin Ni  he gravitate toward unknown object which in this case a sea and make hunches weeks before bad thing happen  Midoriya Si  he gravitate toward already known existence figure which All Might and make plan after bad things happen  he doesn t have hunch prior bad things happen  it when things happen   ,infj
https   www youtube com watch v vH XHC Ddmw Pure Ni Dom Guys  nothing more to add  this guy shares the same personality type and subtype with Armin Arlert from SNK he is a INFJ Fe Subtype  A ISFJ head would Explode in seconds just by trying to elaborate a Plan like this one  Why  too much information  too much what if situations and on top of that he has to figure out what is the most likely outcome  Just no Guys  the ISFJ just can t elaborate something like this with that Inferior Ne and Demonic Ni oh no  Demonic is the  th Function and you what does this means  The ISFJ just will crash trying to use Ni foreseing implications and patterns  that means ,infj
Lol those ISFJ Votes  How does it feels smoking weed  Si learns throught past experiences and uses notes   blah blah blah IDIOT  That isnt how Si even works  Si is a subjetive sensorial function  giving some subjective interpretation to some object  Ritual  Routine  that is Si  Drinking coffee at same hour everyday  Doing same Ritual before determinated action  Giving priority to your Grandmother and Parents teachings  Always dressing in a same way due to being  Just comfortable  to you  Refusing to eat something due to a bad experience adhered to that type of Food  Si is a comfort Function Si is Comfort  Se is Experience  Ni as Dom and Aux is Guessing capability  both Ni and Si learn from past  What is the difference  Ni uses past impressions for figuring its patrons  therefore having hunches or guesses about what is the most likely future scenario and narrowing down their interest to Just   only thing  just as Si Users Ni is obsessed with the subjetive the difference is the Si user Obsessed with the tradition  the familiar  Common things  whereas Ni is Obsessed with the future  what they want to be EX  Deku obsessed with becoming a great hero  just as Allmight since Kid  That is a Ni Dom Kid  Not Si  Its impossible ,infj
I can feel the Si dom  The way he learns to fight is from his past experiences  which is very Si  He has problems improvising and often sticks to his notes  Though i understand why people voted for INFJ  a very apparent Fe user yet an introvert   but i never saw him as an Ni dom ,infj
Honestly  INFJ  Midoriya as idealist  just because he didn t give up when it literally common sense   Si   Ni   He want to be exactly like All Might  his costume based on All Might  his ideal taken from All Might  He get kicking shoot style after experiment hand on  Taking notes about pro hero for future reference  The rare moment where he make his own plan  you did realize that he focused on surrounding s detail alot Kamino Shouji s tentacle saving experiment  which Si Ti rather than Ni Ti  Cavalry Battle he used someone else movement  And for an Ni  he doesn t have plan for weeks or years  he plan at the moment   Fe   Fi   Take All Might s ideal  For him  heroes are good and villains are bad  He can t connect with La Brava s problem because she villains  Someone kicking me  he kid and isn t a villains so he must be good  His view heroes allies  villain enemies  Isn t even his own ideal  its All Might s ideal  He refuse to see Stain s views because of this    Caring too much about future and making own plan prior before things happen  when  ,infj
I know  you won t believe me because i m an ISFJ    BUT  HE IS   an ISFJ with the two last functions  PI   NE  kinda evolved  But  even with his analysis before a fight  He pretty much miss things and experience teach him  some plans he make are good  ISFJ can make plans but it takes efford  and he does because the first experience when he almost die teached him  but he can t just stand quiet when he see someone he cares is in danger  he risk himself to do it  he just throw himself at do something without consider the options  and he punish himself A LOT  till he reach a limit of danger then he knows he can push it  and maybe ISFJ we are stubborn  but we are not idiots  we don t want to die  my friend and i being INFJ   ISFJ we feel we are pretty evolved in our personalities  but i have to admit  Midoriya is just a liiitle more evolved that I in NE  but btw still ISFJ  He actually give the best of himself because he is working in what he dreams  He want to be a Hero and he put everything of himself  his brain  his soul and was being motivated by many people Even his Hero  And i don t know sometimes i feel the character is made like this exactly for more than a person can feel related  If you see the choose of the people  He is     The Counselor      The Protector      The Healer   Now    Which one u consider that fits totally of what we have seen of this character so far   No ovas included  Because   I see a protector on him more than a counselor,infj
He has strong dominant Fi followed by Se     ISFPs can get too emotional and seem like they have Fe   But he doesn t   He is an impulsive feeler who rushes in ,infj
I could make a case for Ne and Si but I can t see him as a Fi dom  Actually his observations seems more Ti and Si  ISFJ,infj
Deku is an moralist Fi subtype INFP ,infj
He s introvert  I would say he s N more than S because he thinks about the future to be one of the best heroes  definitely a feeler  he s a J because he worries about his affects I believe  He s an INFJ,infj
Ni  Izuku has a firm grasp on his goals  Unlike Ne  which is concerned with seeking possibilities and making connections   he is concerned with seeing how his goals can impact the very environment that he s in  He tends to have problems changing his perspectives because of this  which causes the problems as of why he idolizes All Might and Bakugo so much  he doesn t see them as mere idols  but goalposts of which he strives to reach  He also is good at reading outside the box such as when he deduces a villian s plan based on a simple exchange of words in chapter      Ni is good at discerning patterns from symbolic devices like language and such  ,infj
He s a basic INFP protagonist i d say  I only watched   seasons tho  but I don t think the other episodes would change my opinion ,infj
I m gonna go with ISFJ because he learns everything from experience  Si  and not by just observing  He always takes notes and is very analytical BUT when it counts he really doesn t learn until he goes through that himself  I can t see why people would think he is a Ni dom just because he is imaginative  He also has a genuine interest in people that makes it look like he has high Fe ,infj
ISFJ  HE really does love to learn how things work or the train of thought that people have to figuire how strong his arguement is Ti   Si is finding value in the present moment and he does this alot  it is why he sticks around bakugo even if his attutude is to harsh  He wants to see the good here with him  and he values it  Si is pretty much a loyal gaurdian archetype which describes midoriya to a T  Si has a golden mean scale  you either someone they value or you not  He really does not look to the bigger picture like all might does saving and fighting criminals because is right and future calls for it   His J neuroticism makes him plan alot and jot down skills on his notebook he wants to learn before even getting into the action part  Si his mentalization of current reality that he wants to learn more about Ti ,infj
I don t know how people type him INFJ  probably fits Tokoyami much better   He s clearly way too emotional and goes with his heart  Contradicts the calm and thoughtfulness of Ni Ti INFJs ,infj
He s INFP for sure  his way of finding solutions to problems is not ni  it s his si that does that work with his ne  He has even tipical fi si triggers every two second  idk how you could think he is a ni dominat,infj
For starters  let me say that I am essentially not opposed to Deku being an ISFJ  but here is how I arrived to my current working hypothesis of him being an INTP   Both INTP and ISFJ voters probably arrived to the conclusion that Deku has the Si  Ne  Ti and Fe functions   Si  meticulously makes notes on superheroes  Ne  quickly comes up with original solutions  Ti  extremely analytical  reflective  Fe  the Fe is critical  Very emotional  wants to help others  Now for the function order  Deku is a curious case  as he is either a very analytical and socially awkward ISFJ or a very emotional INTP  both of which are rather uncommon and defy usual stereotypes  I believe the solution may lie in the inferior function  ISFJ s inf function is Ne  meaning they aren t good with change and prefer a clear structure  are grounded in the real world  We don t see that in Deku ,infj
He is a feeler  Too much ISFJ ,infj
i used to have the fattest crush on him,infj
not y all thinking u know him better than he knows himself LMAO and as an INFP i can t really see how he would be one,infj
Explanations on sp     sp so seems correct ig,infj
I m pretty sure he s not actually an INFJ  He seems too extraverted to be an INFJ  besides his  iNtRoVeRtS bE lIkE  videos  He also seems to use a lot of Ne  not Ni  I am still unsure of his type  but I am pretty sure he s not an INFJ ,infj
i just want to say  we really don t know anything about fj outside of his content  so generally speaking  i really don t think we could accurately type him  if we wanted to   with that said  i don t necessarily doubt he is an INFJ  he s taught me a lot about typology and he has a pretty good understanding of it too  so i d imagine he could type himself accurately  and he s typed dozens of others so      ,infj
I have a feeling he s really good at lying manipulating so ima say ENFJ,infj
Can someone explain his Ni ,infj
why phlegmatic dominant  i think phlegmatic melancholic or melancholic phlegmatic make more sense ,infj
  I dont see any Ni    Bro how are you supposed to see an internal oriented function associated with images and tones rather than actual descreption  My argument is you dont know him personally nor can you be sure abt an introverted function because he is the one experiencing it s potential  Not to mention yhe clear existence of Fe and Ti in every argument he gives ,infj
i can see why some of you would say ENFP because    he said he got that on the test he took so i guess ppl who don t know more about mbti would agree  and    he seems like he has pretty strong fi and ne  so having said that i understand why  now let me say that this mans introverted intuition is so painfully obvious it s hilarious some of you don t see it  let me show you one of many examples of him being an Ni dom   Take love as an example  There are many different themes in love  right  There are songs you can listen to and simply surmise   Oh  this is written by a man after a break up because he wants to hold on to the woman he loves    Rather than writing something as straightforward flat as this  I would dearly love to refine and shape something more abstract  Abstraction can feel vague and maybe not as bold  but if you look at the history of painting  abstract art came onto the scene after figurative art  It s difficult to express something through exact representation alone and I believe abstraction is the compression of a thing s essence  maybe just through its colour or form    plus   could be    yes  but the equation could also contain brackets or inequality notations    I m more and more excited by the possibilities that can be found in these blank spaces    i mean  come on   i think his enneagram greatly contributes to him being perceived as an ENFP since he s a  w   but other than that please listen to him in interviews and you ll see ,infj
I see why people think he is an ENFP but INFJ make more sense  I saw some books he readed and it shows  Ni   for the enneagram  idk  I just saw someone explain it really convince me      ,infj
Ni is misidentified by other people  but it can be felt by the subject s philosophy  Namjoon is one of the most purely INFJ people I know  he has an ENFP soul  and by that I mean he want to be free  As a person with a philosophy of freedom and being open to whatever comes his way  he got the ENFP on the test  Being one or the other  he s a very sincere person anyway  and I m inspired by that ,infj
Many people have already provided great INFJ arguments based on how Namjoon has described himself  so I wanted to also consider how his friends acquaintances describe him  since they might make a more unbiased assessment of his character  I was just thinking about the interview Jackson Wang did with Zach Sang  where he talks about his friendship with Namjoon  Here are some interesting things Jackson says about Namjoon    He doesn t talk much  but whatever he says  it just feels right    When I run into problems  I ll just be like  rants    and then he ll sum up everything and give me a good conclusion  you know what you should do  you should do this  this  etc    Also when talking about Namjoon as a leader of BTS and the success of the group  he mentions how good they are at  thinking ahead   Even though he s talking about BTS in general  Jackson specifically aligns this statement to Namjoon and said that because of  his  Namjoon s  personality   he s not surprised the group is successful    So based on these quotes I can see a lot of Ni in Namjoon  specially in how he manages to  sum up  multiple situations  as per Jackson s words  High Ni users have a tendency to find a common pattern between multiple truths and simplify them into one statement conclusion  For them  everything is connected and it all leads to something  a meaning  a culmination  an answer  etc  This seems to be exactly how Namjoon thinks  His words always seems to  just feel right  to Jackson  which to me is also a quality of NiFe users  who have a very specific  simplified way of looking at things  Ni  and use this vision to pacify or comfort others  Fe     I also see a lot of Fe in Namjoon based on these descriptions  Notice how he is always presented as part of a group or a relationship  as the friend who will always offer his wisdom and advice  as the leader member of the group  etc    He naturally manifests himself not as an individual  but as part of something bigger or through a connection with someone else     I hope this makes sense  Even though Namjoon knows himself more than anyone  I thought it d be interesting to analyze his functions from the outside lens of someone as honest  and as close to him  as Jackson  Here s the link to the interview ,infj
I know the consensus has already voted INFJ but I thought I d make a more detailed argument for why that is  Let s look at his creative process to get a better glance at which functions he uses the most and how   In an interview with WSJ magazine  Suga  J Hope  and RM all talked about their creative process when writing songs    Suga s Ni Te Fi means he pinpoints to a certain concept and works his way from there  Ni builds up  we always start with one thing and build outwards  while Ne takes from the outside first  then eliminates until they re left with one option that works the best  especially with Te in the mix    Suga s Te helps him filter out things pretty quickly  so he s not spending too much time on things he knows won t help him in his process   J hope uses his Si Ne to create the most  He searches for inspiration outwards then he eliminates  he s a Tert Ne  but Ne still heavily influences his creative process which I thought was pretty interesting    Suga and RM are pretty similar in their creative process  except for RM it takes waaaaay longer to finish a song  and that s because he uses introverted thinking instead of extroverted thinking  His creative process is a lot like mine  I can have a spark of an idea but it can take years for it to manifest into anything concrete     RM  who has credits on many of BTS s biggest songs  will dwell on a line from a movie or a passing scene  sometimes for years  before starting to work it into his lyrics    Writing songs  takes a long time for me   says RM   So it hurts  body and soul  when I have to throw one away     His Fe  and Ti  is prevalent  I don t know why ENFP voters keep saying they don t see it  He very much caters to his audience unlike Yoongi who is in tune with himself in his lyrics  Suga always talks about how he writes what he feels calls to and is grateful when the audience connects with it  but RM seems to try to understand what others may connect to first  and in the interview below he talks about not adding songs that were too personal in the album because he didn t like the idea of being that vulnerable   Plus even now he still seems to be trying to figure out who he is in all of this because of his lack of Fi usage   Anyway here are some examples    And what about you  as one individual person    RM  I m a real Korean person   laughs  A person who wants to do something in Korea  I think millennials are charging into society stuck between the analog and digital generations  and what I chose is BTS  So I try to integrate myself into our generation  try to understand what people like me are thinking  and try to work hard to capture that feeling without being a burden on them  This might be another kind of irony itself  but this is who I am  I m a    year old Korean  That s what I think   Music is your job  but also your life  Like you expressed in  Dis ease   how would you say you feel about your work   RM  This is my job and my calling and I feel a great sense of responsibility  I think I m lucky and happy that I can solely worry about my creative process  And I feel very responsible to those people who put their trust in me  so I try not to cross any lines  judge myself honestly  and always be professional  Those are the responsibilities that come with the job the things I have to do and the promises I won t betray  But if I m going to do it  I m going to be happy while I do it  That s not always going to be possible  but that s generally how I feel   You guys can read the rest of this interview below  strong Ni Fe Ti all around  The way he analyzes himself  his work  his team  and just life is just wow  I really hope he does more in depth interviews in the future  he s a really thoughtful and insightful mind  and it feels like he has a lot he wants to say      Also again  compared to Suga s and V s interviews  his lack of Te is very apparent  They get straight to the point while he ll add tangents and stories to conclude his train of thought  like the story about him running after the cloud ,infj
How is he INFJ lmao  Obviously dom Ne and inferior Si that makes him clumsy and heads on the clouds  His lyrics is shouting Fi how is he an Fe aux  And Ni dom  Yoongi has Ni dom as he is an INTJ  how is namjoon using his Ni then if he s an INFJ  In the members Yoongi  Jimin and Jungkook are the ones who uses Ni function  You could have already seen a bit of similarities in the use of Ni if he s an INFJ  Thinking as he s an INFJ  how similar is his Fe to Jimin and Jhope as Fe dom or like Jin with inferior Fe behavior towards other members  These three  especially Jimin and Jhope as Jin has inferior fe  in every videos of them you could see them not having too much alone time as they re busy accompanying other members  While namjoon wants to be alone and do the things he wants  he also doesn t want to do things alone at all times since he thinks it his responsibility to accompany the members as well as he is the leader of the group and doesn t want to feel like his neglecting the members  Even where his Fe cognitive function was placed  it should still be used but can t see the Fe there while Jin has inferior Fe  you could still see him use it  Namjoon  Taehyung  Jungkook and Yoongi are all Fi users ,infj
wait but how is he an EII  i was torn between IEI and EIE  however i m leaning towards the first one  i really don t see namjoon as Se PoLR ,infj
i m pretty sure that he is INFJ  i ve been thinking about it and decided that he s one of the clearest examples of an INFJ  some of y all saying that he s not looking by what they have to do in front of the cameras and stuff but that s why we are voting for INFJ  just look at the lyrics he wrote himself  the way he describes everything and the way he thinks  acts  he s the literal INFJ  if we were looking what he does when he is being recorded like you said  he WOULD be ENFP  as an ENFP myself  i can t even see him as that type   ,infj
All of his past controversies and how he reacted to them at first kinda makes me think Fi user  He s probably developed his Fe and even uses his Fi in a healthier way now  but even with all of the previous explanations I m not seeing INFJ  I think he might be an ENFP but his enneagram kinda gives him a different vibe  I don t know this is so complicated lol  EDIT  Coming here to say that I see it now  I guess his company wants him to seem more ENFP ish but I read somewhere that the person he s most alike in the group is actually Suga  I also think about the fact that he s clearly not a very openly affectionate person by nature just like Suga  but if one of the members show him affection he will show it right back whereas Suga will pretty much reject it be embarrassed by it  Fe vs Fi    He s really well developed  so in front of cameras he can play up the ENFP thing a lot  but apparently behind closed doors he s very introverted and pretty much keeps to himself  He s grown a lot  and I guess his reactions to previous controversies was probably due to immaturity  but the more I read what other people say about him  the less I see ENFP  And his extroverted intuition and thinking is less apparent now the more I ve analyzed him  Him not being able to cut up a carrot  or just do everyday things but then turn around and solve a math equation with no problem will forever be funny  because same  Also the whole not being able to drive thing  which is honestly my favorite INFJ stereotype because it almost always checks out lol  When he has to interact with the outer world outside of what he s already good at he seems so confused  Like he s given more options on how to do things and his brain goes  no wait  stop   He s a really good example of a social chameleon because I was going through a crisis trying to figure him out  like bravo sir  very good performance ,infj
Baz   ark lar  ENTJ vibe  veriyor diye  ark c ya ENTJ oyu veren kullan c lar  d ,infj
Honestly  I m a bit surprised to see someone typed EIE on PDB that I don t agree with given the accusations towards SHS that we type everyone EIE  But I don t see it here with her  She seems more like IEI than EIE  Temperament wise she seems more Ip than Ej  Definitely seems more Ni heavy than Fe heavy  and while this can be true with H EIEs quite easily  she seems more positivist than an EIE would be  Ni  over Ni   Seems more introverted cognitively than extraverted  more depth  than breadth  I can also more easily see vortical synergetic cognition than dialectical algorithmic with her  Said that it was difficult for her to express negative emotions in the past and has expressed a need for song writing   which makes me inclined to say Fe is in self realization rather than social mission block  Also hard to see Fi control  Reminds me of an ILI I know IRL too more so than EIE   Does seem likely a Creative subtype  which again counts further against EIE since I can t really see her as EIE C at all   Not sure on secondary subtype  Could be CN  double ignoring  Doesn t seem CD  although IEI CD would be atypical for a CD due to the mediating nature of IEI   Don t think double initial is likely  Don t think there s any AO Shift  music is a fairly NF industry anyway  Has described herself as an extreme perfectionist  and I think she likely has an accentuated Ti  which is somewhat atypical for IEIs  normally they rely on others for Ti as it s their launcher function and it s normally off    Thinking about it  enneagram   would likely point towards CD subtype I think  Will type her IEI CD with Ti accentuation ,infj
She is a core   and i will die on this ,infj
It s funny like everyone in PDB thinks every singer is  w   And at the same time  you say MARINA refuse to please others or to be more recognized by others  priorizing to be alone and genuine  And yes  fives everywhere when you read her ideas and her lyrics     w     so missunderstood as  w     INFP  w   Maybe    INFJ  w   Who knows       But  w     Ok then  guys  Ok   w  will be  fine  Have it your way   ,infj
She commented on Twitter she is an INFJ  As an Ni user I have honestly not seen a more obvious INFJ ever  She is a clear four  or at least dominant wing  as well so not shy at all to express herself ,infj
I m voting for  w  again because of the way she talks about her job in interviews  she s too concerned about being herself to be a  ,infj
 This argument is not finished yet  I will complement it as soon as possible    When I first saw this profile  I was kinda confused  According to her song lyrics  especially older ones like Oh No  and Are You Satisfied   She clearly looked like a  w  to me  So I decided to see an interview with her to make sure of my vote  and guess what  It didn t take me two minutes to make sure she s a  w   She want to be connected to what she does  and the break in her career was exactly because she no longer felt that connection in her songs  She said she wanted to explore herself and expressing that in the lyrics  This sounds a lot more like a  w  than a  w     And English is not my native language  sorry if there s any mistakes  ,infj
To be honest sometimes I think she is an ENFJ and just socially introverted  or an ISFP with very strong Ni  but I m not sure  I lean on the side of her being an Fe user so ENFJ makes more sense as a guess to me now  Is there any actual proof for Ni dom or Se inferior ,infj
It s hard to have cognitive function evidence but since she is really into psychology and has stated she is an INFJ when asked in a tweet  i doubt she would know she is an INFJ unless looking deeply into that by taking more tests and looking at the cognitive functions  She may seem extroverted at times but has stated and promoted the power of introversion  and many INFJs tend to be seen as the extrovert of the introverts ,infj
I ll gather evidence someday  or someone will  but marina has stated many times that she cares more about being true to herself and staying original  she disliked doing anything commercial or generic that ll make her more cash n help her recognition because it didn t feel true or genuine to her  These aren t her exact words but from my own memory  so I could absolutely be wrong but from what I ve watched in interviews she has said something along those lines  Either way  I think you guys may be confusing her sx   as core    because they can be similar  but the difference is the motivation  she wanted to prove her dad wrong by becoming a pop star singer because he was opposed to it  which only motivated her more  Her album family jewels reek of ennea   sure  but they also have strong traits and similarities of a ennea sx    I ll make a better argument when I get the energy  these are just from what I ve gathered from researching abt her the past few years  my bad if I get anything wrong  feel free to let me know I appreaciate it   but I really think there s confusion mistaking her sx   as enneagram  ,infj
Why enneagram   lmao can someone genuinely explain like   ,infj
can anyone tell me why sp  ,infj
the second he opened his mouth i KNEW he had to be INFJ please,infj
whys he so cool i love him,infj
I d like to ask  why is   last fix the consensus  Where has he shown any   traits  Just because someone is reserved and creative doesn t immediately make them a    Remember that everyone in the game always talk in a quirky way  I personally think   last fix would make much more sense  especially if w    Let me explain  if  w  with   fix would probably externalize their chivalry in a more personal way to share a peek into their individuality and unique identity and ethics that they have carefully crafted  Of course  it is last fix so it would be a bit more diminished  but still present   Xingqiu however  is more prone to a detached expression of his chivalry  which we can see in the way he handled the situation with Chang  but not because he considers it a unique trait of his  but because he sees it aligns to his own idealized moral code  w   which allows him to help others and find his place in the world    fix   He never outwardly expresses it though  unless with really close friends and when he feels comfortable enough  and even then  you can say he is a bit clumsy at it  ie  his pranks   Now  this is heavily related to his Fe suggestive  LII   but I digress    You can see his idealization and attachment to chivalry   w   as a sense of achieving high morality in his voice lines       To me  the saying  May my final stand be a monument to chivalry  is about abandoning worldly possessions and reaching enlightenment  But the stag s final resting place represents the hope for life anew  Oh  how I d love to see it again    It is not a sense of being an advocate in a w  way with a detachment of his identity from others    fix   but rather looking to achieve personal closure through a good morale  even if through a more lowkey approach   w    and finding a place to belong and be appreciated and loved    fix    I sometimes struggle stablishing my thoughts  so if you have any feedback  please go ahead and say them  Thanks for reading  ,infj
INFJ always felt obvious to me  Ni is amazing  it s just Fe sometimes sems a little overshadowed in the fandom by his Ti    w  is mostly based around his general demeanor  I was considering  w  or  w  as well  or maybe even  w  so that he d be related to    but make of that what you want I guess ,infj
Btw he s an obvious   core  You can see the   integration a bit in his story quest  Also  his desire is to be correct and good  He is also very perfectionistic  Btw imo he s more  w  than  w  tbh   edit idk if hes  w  or  w  but just voting  w  for now idk why   Also healthy INFJ  ni ti and fe is obvious  also hes not in a loop  just ni ti but hes fe is also pretty fine  Also  he s one of my supports as a keqing main,infj
Could someone please tell me in what ways Xingqiu express the usual  s coping mechanisms  without using any stereotypes nor an unspoken agreement that  he likes to read so his hobbies are withdrawn  he copes by secluding from the world     Because all I see so far are good explanations on why he shows more   than    as well as good reminders of what a   is but absolutely nothing on how XINGQIU relates to that  and what kind of   behaviours he exhibits   All I found was that he  avoids his responsabilities  which is fair but also very much not a   only thing   could easily point to  for example  a   if we stop focusing on the fact that he likes to read  And the main other thing was a shortcut from   s avoid partaking in the world  to  Xingqiu avoids taking his rightful place   duties as  nd son  that s his   showing   With no explanation as to WHY he does it  Admittedly  I haven t read all of his story since I m a rather new player  but what I ve heard   seen  seemed to point toward him avoiding his responsabilities because he d rather be doing something else  has other aspirations etc    I heard that he s kind of living vicarously through his friends  jumping on many occasions to prank others or go on adventures with Chongyun    He also gets along with Hu Tao much better than the other Liyue kids  including Chongyun who certainly shows a strong     Xingqiu is well spoken  witty   well read for sure  But he honestly doesn t seem nearly as calm and withdrawn secluded  to me  as the comments here make him appear  I ll admit I m very confused  Mostly because  as I said  there are some very well written comments and   descriptions  but I REALLY don t understand how Xingqiu relates to said   descriptions  Help me out  I m willing to hear it,infj
so i think that while we re all on the same page regarding       core   wudyaaaa brought up a good point that there isn t really any discussion on  w  vs  w    part of the reason that people were inclined to assume he was a    other than obvious stereotypes  was that xingqiu is rather reserved and conservative with his energy  w s are a lot more inclined to step back from a situation and pursue the change they desire independently as opposed to wing  s which are a lot more inclined to getting involved with others and immersing themselves emotionally in a situation they might not have originally been involved with  i think that in his first quest  the bookworm swordsman  had he been a w   he would have been a lot more involved in coming along with and helping the traveler  i think he also would have taken more interest in coming to understand chang the ninth s feelings    another example of some nine behavior is xingqiu s tendency to slip away from his role as the son of the feiyun commerce guild s manager  his sense of justice and morals is grounded  but his interest in reality is fleeting otherwise  as he often indulges in his stories or thoughts alone  w s tend to be more interested in stepping away from the loud  undesirable parts of reality to immerse themselves in their own world    being a w  doesn t necessarily diminish a core   s desire to change the world  they just take a more distanced  less personal approach than w s  i think that this is more accurate to xingqiu  but if you have any arguments for w  id love to read them  honestly i can see either wing  i just think w  is a little more prevalent    edit  please do look below in the replies for more discussion  i m actually leaning on the w  side now ,infj
I think a loooot of  INFPs  are ENFP  ISFP  INFJ  or INTJ  Some runner ups would be INFJ and xNTP     A lot of ENFPs mistype as introverts because its not a blatently extraverted type    A decent chunk of ISFPs with decent Ni or creative ways mistype as INFP    I genuinely think the whole  INFP mistyped as INFJ  being super common is reversed  and its more often INFJs who mistype as INFPs  and INTPs     A suprising amount of INTJs with developed Fi type as INFP atleast for a while    Other types mistype as INFP on tests too because the questions asked for the I N F and P letters are generally the most easy to agree with and sound the least demonizing insulting,infj
Probably INxP  because they believe the results from   personalities i guess,infj
Not actually the MOST common  but very common  The archetype of ENTPs is so warped that ESTPs  ENFPs  even some ESFPs get typed as ENTP both irl and in fiction  One look at the ENTP board will prove it to you  dw mistypes  I was there once    Meanwhile actual ENTPs get typed INTP     w  is not the most common  but a common one that isn t talked about enough  People have such a shallow understanding of enneagram    isn t just the smart  intellectual type  if anything that s  s   the most important part is their disconnect from emotions and their withdrawal from society   Also  people type themselves as accommodating  lol   Plus  people think IV is separate from enneagram  and type themselves sp sx just because they don t wanna die and idk want a gf ,infj
My friend was mistyped as an INFP she s actually an ISTP my other friend was mistyped as an INFP she s actually an ISFP and yes they used    personalites,infj
Guys  i m asking out of curiosity how can you distinguish between INFP and INFJ,infj
It s INTP   By personal observation  INTPs never mistype as INTJs  INTJs do  INTPs never mistype as INFJs  INFJs do  INTPs never mistype as ISTPs  ISTPs do  INTPs never mistype as ENTPs  ENTPs do  INTPs never mistype as INFPs  INFPs do   Not that INTPs are super smart  but Ti clearly knows what it is   and other people linking curiosity and thirst for analysis as Ti Ne mistype as INTP ,infj
I mean  for general public people who don t really get into this stuff  and only do the   p test  we all know it s INxx  On this site  reddit and the typing community in general it s ENTP  sx sp   w  and  w   Some people really want to be those types lol,infj
INFP being misunderstood and seen as exclusively imaginative and introverted and kind is what makes most people think they re one  i think most people who are very lightly interested in mbti but only in the journey of discovering their own type are most likely to type themselves as INFPs  can t disregard how   p types everyone as an INFP INFJ though so it s funny how much one popular website has such a profound effect on mbti and its misunderstanding,infj
 you re too cheerful to be ENTP  you must be an ENFP   ,infj
My first mistype on every typing system I studied  enneagram related things are to be taken independently from each other  ,infj
Why INFx over ENTP  INFXs are usually very quiet  since they re introverted introverts  INXX are   ENTPs on the other hand can talk about nothing but MBTI nonstop without getting bored sometimes  me included ,infj
Definitely me lol,infj
It s a me ,infj
Not talking about mbti because it is not scientific   ,infj
ENTP bc i said so,infj
I feel bad for my sister   the only one I can talk about it  she can t stand me anymore And she s an ENFP lol,infj
you guys realize that this isn t something to be proud of  right ,infj
Is this a call out poll     I need to infect my friends with MBTI    THEY NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING        Okay  I might be a bit annoying when I start to talk about MBTI around my friends  but they also discover information about themselves  And it helps them to understand people s personality better such as how to treat them  what s the best way to communicate with them  etc ,infj
i don t tell others about my obsession with typology but i think about it NONSTOP  its becoming an issue please help,infj

im surprised that no one is speaking on her manipulativneess in these comments at all,infj
 The biggest difference between the  w  vs  w  is the  w s core desire is for themselves to be perfect and harmonious versus if you re a  w   you care more about society being perfect and you re a little bit more about serving others     https   www makingmindfulnessfun com enneagram  w   w  comparison    w  s are more focused on internal peacemaking and  w  s are more focused on external peacemaking  and as we saw during the inazuma story quest and ayaka s story quest  she is more concerned about external issues going on in inazuma  the vision hunt decree etc etc ,infj
Honestly  I really just view her as ISFJ because of the other genshin characters of the same type  and then how they re written  Jean  Ganyu and Noelle are all very  very similar to Ayala  I see her Si Ne much more than the Ni Se  mostly  She views planning and simplicity with a flair for beauty much more than her own energy and inner creativity  If she was INFJ  she d probably be much more proactive and believe in more in herself ,infj
Alright  let s try giving this a shot Why I believe  w   w     Phlegmatic Melancholic    w  s are actually more involved with people than you might think   w  s are ofc more involved with people but the big difference is  they are more vocal about it  and will involve themselves more into people s affairs and make themselves the   center of attention   while doing so  and are more controlling of people and and use their actions as justifications    w  s however  they are type  s that tend to get involved with people as much as necessary  BUT with the  w  s they want to retreat as soon as they can to avoid any more danger  think of it as a  s inner critic that things are going to be deep  to elaborate more   w  s tend to repress their own values and beliefs to keep things going to solve a situation  troubleshooting a situation while remaining as distant away from it as possible  while also looking out for any future unforseen circumstance  because of that  it can lead to a lot of repressed emotions later on in life if they are not expressing where they stand  This is visible in her quest when she went to talk to the trading association guy in her quest     I only wish life could be as leisurely as this a little more often    How greedy of me      s inner critic in the works  followed by   s desire to enjoy the moment in which things are stable and smooth  before getting bombarded by her work of checking the the affairs of the Kamisato clan  which by the way  her role involves her dealing with people s affairs  Enneagream typings are not just by value  but approach to situations too                                                                                    As for her instincts  I still doubt sp so  but if I tried to make any sense of it  An sp  tends to first make ideals  then prepare for them as much as possible  Ayaka s main ideal from the story which is also the reason she decided to take her role in the Kamisato estate  is to belittle as much as she can from Ayato s pain of being the heir to the clan  and Ayato being troubled with affairs can damage the clan s reputation possibly due to not always being available  it stands to reason that taking responsibility will also make the clan suffer from less criticism  if you think this is all related to social connections and business  then do not forget that she has good usage of Ni Fe    Self Pres Ones into an obsession with self perfection  so they work hard to become overly responsible  upstanding  and exemplary  Self Pres Ones can feel triggered by criticism from others and become defensive or rigid  They repress their feelings more than the other two subtypes  often coming across as gentle and obedient  It is hard for them to get in touch with their feelings because they only allow themselves to feel whatever they  or society or culture  deem as  good     I believe this can describe Ayaka well    Social Ones often feel pressure to live up to who they  should be  in each of these spaces to exemplify and enlighten others into more righteous behavior  They internally take on a teacher persona in situations  embodying the model or ideal of what a person should say or do to be correct and do things well for everyone s good  They truly see many of the areas in their circles of influence that could be improved or fixed  When using this energy in healthy ways and with a dose of humbleness  Ones are a great asset to their communities  If they focus too much on imperfections  though  Social Ones can neglect to identify all the wonderful gifts each community offers just as it is  Social Ones focus on issues of justice and wide reaching reform  they like to pinpoint the errors and missteps of others   minus the teacher part  we can see this in Ayaka as well  so I would say it s either SP SO or SO SP  I will say that I believe she is an sx blind      though   UPDATE  SP  SO  SO  SP makes so much more sense  so I ll go with sp  so                                                                                   If you have a counterargument  please be nice about it    ,infj
ok like VEFL and EII is contradictory tbh  if its very obvious shes a V   then why dont we reconsider IEE  ESI or IEI or idk  if its very obvious shes EII  than couldnt we consider LEFV  FEVL  EVFL or something   i dont know her ap or socionics very well but i am just saying   also i think shes more of a  w  than  w   btw obvious sp  ,infj
finally finishing her story quest  why is she typed INFJ  her whole story quest is about Fe and Se  Is she just not voted as an E type because she doesn t have many friends  because to me her Se is too strong to be inferior  it isn t that she wants to pretend  to herself  she doesn t like sensory stuffs  it s because of her image that she can t do it  she is true to herself that she actually wants it  and her Ni and Ti isn t actually that strong  compared to Yae which is probably either ENTP or INFJ  which she had strong plans  Ayaka barely did anything,infj
i m kind of torn on her enneagram  i wonder   if any of u think she might just seem like a w  because of her position leading the kamisato clan ,infj
For kamisato ayaka her attitundal psyche she is definitely  E but her v might be a passive subtype unlike the other subtypes  v passive might reassemble  v because it is not aggressive with its volition but they feel confident in their willpower work ethic and etc which I think kamisato ayaka is but her socionics might either be eii or esi or iee since people are saying for  v she can t be se polr but I want to see what you guys think,infj
can someone enlighten me on where they see Ti Se and especially Fe Ni ,infj
I get that she s INFJ  as most ppl already do  but I m still not sure on her wing  Why w    w  ,infj
its been a while since i watched but are you sure he s a two at all  does he have ego pride or is he just a nice person ,infj
I don t know his mbti but my girlfriend says we re so similar lol,infj
loml he s perfect spectacular amazing show stopping beautiful outstanding out of this world ,infj
I definitely think he s more like  w  than  w ,infj
I agree he s definitely  w   but if I may ask why did we come to INFJ here ,infj
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY I love him  he has like everyting like me   ,infj
Really wanted some arguments to why people are saying he s  w ,infj
He s so cute plsss I wanna marry him,infj
I see myself in this man a lot  He is very healthy INFJ,infj
I always thought him having a   fix was a bit strange ,infj
Can t believe I just realized just how ridiculous the enneagram consensus is lmao  In which universe is Falco an sx   Well it s not in this one that s for sure ,infj
no way this boy is a Ni dom   he does resemble armin in a way bc hes very peaceful compared to others but he doesnt have the vision and insight that Ni doms typically do hes just really sensitive to other people s suffering and a very empathetic kid  I d say Fe dom but I m not sure about the Ni aux maybe ESFJ would fit better,infj
Action oriented   very quick physical reactions there s no way he s inferior Se   Not sure about his type tho,infj
i m literally stalking this page atp  if we can do it for historia we can do it for falco,infj
he is more introvert than extrovert,infj
no cause when i was typing him fe was such a given to me idk   besides the fact that he has dreams of the future his ni is still weaker than his fe ,infj
I m not an expert in mbti but i thought falco was an ISFJ lol,infj
While everyone s arguing over the two xNFJs  I d like to offer an explanation for his socionics type since no one seems to have bothered to give one   I agree with the EII consensus  Falco is very much concerned about his personal relationships  He also has strong ethical standards and strives to live by them  his belief that Marleyans and Eldians can live in peace come to mind  which is very characteristic of Fi base  Creative Ne is shown through Falco s open mindedness  Although he has strict moral standards  Falco is still willing to listen and understand the views of others although he may not necessarily agree  the scene where he explained to Gabi why Eren and the others invaded Marley come to mind   He also prefers to implement his moral standards and beliefs not through use of force and his own volition  indicating Se PoLR  but through reasoning and finding creative alternative ways to solve problems  Ne creative   Falco is shown to be very forgiving and merciful as well  He forgave Connie and cooperated with him despite Connie offering Falco to be eaten to fix his mother  for example  If his Fi were to be blocked with Se I doubt he would be as forgiving and would hold grudges a lot more  take a look at the SEE Gabi to see what I mean   He is also quite resilient to the use of force himself  Whenever Gabi agressively forces her beliefs on others  Falco rarely retalliates agressively but refuses to bow down as well    On another note  can anyone explain why he s FELV  I got the impression he would be a  E type but my knowledge of AP isn t very good ,infj
only argument i get for ENFJ here  Fe is strong   yea maybe because its his extroverted function  it s his way to communicate with the outer world  so ofc he will use it a lot  I don t see how his Ti is inferior  and he literally shows no signs of a tert Se as he is also very introverted ,infj
I wonder what made people think he was a core    and thinking Se is inferior hmm,infj
Ive rarely seen a chatacter who was easier to type as a Ni dom  Armin s Ni somewhat was his weapon role especially in season   where the others usually relied on him when it came to figure out connecting  understanding  important and relevant information considering the things they already knew    And Fe because he is kind i guess lmao,infj
I miss his dora cut   ,infj
the ni fe ti is so blatant in the boy  INFJ is the only type that fits him even though he also has strong fi  tactical genius  inf se means he s a bit out of place in the military but he s also clearly one of their best assets considering he was saved over  SPOILER WARNING  erwin  who has more experience  it s sooo gratifying to see him start to understand his worth  i love his arc and his friendship with jean and mikasa  fe over fi  see his conflicting views with jean  an fi user  armin believes that sacrificing human life is necessary sometimes for the greater good and is fully willing to do so  fe ti   jean disagrees with the concept of sacrificing a human life and desires to find a better way  fi  ,infj
he is smart INFJ is impossible he is not stupid Your arguments for INFJ are ridiculous  this comment destroys all before my power to Convince ENTP A the Debater,infj
it hurts seeing my favorite character being typed as INFJ   I i have no words      I thought we all agreed the smartest personality type is ENFP   Why is he INFJ   Literally makes no sense  but then again  this is personality database    ,infj
 spoilers Armin since a young age as wanted to see the sea better yet he wanted to learn more about the outside world  He cherished one of the only books about it with his life because it contained knowledge  His main goal was to learn  In later chapters on the brink of death he began to say things to himself like  your useless   After Erwins death he felt that he had to be of use and that he had no choice because of the guilt he felt being chosen over Erwin  He wanted to genuinely be useful to the scouts to make up for Erwin being gone  So ain t no way he not a    ,infj
I m still watching the female titan arc  but what he said during his conversation with jean after the mission was assumed to have failed  was beautiful  He almost instantly connected with Erwin s Ni  less so Te on a personal level obv   and spoke to jean s Si Ne with a chilling perspective   People who can t throw something important away  can never hope to change anything  ,infj
Armin is a complete INFJ  but as a  w  I struggle to understand why he is a  w   He doesn t really seem to have the values and aspirations of a  w   Can anyone explain the reasoning behind it ,infj
I voted  w  as it makes more sense to me for Armin to be a core   since his insecurities arise from his feelings of worthlessness  He reflects on how he feels inferior to Eren and Mikasa since they were children  they came to his aid when he was bullied because he wasn t strong enough to fend for himself  This sparked his strong desire to be independent  Throughout the whole series he s constantly trying to prove his worth  if not by his physical skills  then by his mind  Even so  he doesn t trust his own judgements  though he s generally correct   he gets anxious and fears so much making mistakes that his extreme caution turns into indecision  I believe this influences many to consider him a  w    However  according to what I ve read  while  s need the support and reassurance of others to operate better   s need to be helpful to others to feel worthy   s fear losing guidance   s fear feeling incapable and disappointing others  And here I come with some spoilers from season    when Eren wants to sever his connections with Mikasa and Armin  he attempts to emotionally attack them where it hurts the most  As we know  Eren is the most important thing to Mikasa  so he tells her that he hates her  but even if Armin loves Eren as well and they had a dream together  he doesn t try the same approach with him Eren tells him that he s useless  because that s what has haunted Armin s entire existence and he  as his best friend for years  knows it quite well  And it works  it leaves Armin speechless  words true or not   The external reliance aspect of  s is even contradictory in Armin  he doesn t seek support from others to make himself feel better  Also  as far as I remember  reassurance only worked on him once  on Trost  after that it has done very little to boost his confidence in his own plans  Even Erwin s praise could not  a figure Armin greatly admired  actually made him feel more nervous  You can blame it on the particularity of the situation  though   So my argument is not that Armin is  w  just because he s smart and likes to learn new things  although I have to say that he s an explorer at heart and his curiosity is only rivaled by Hange s  I know nothing is perfect  and there are some  w  traits that don t match Armin that much either  I m new to this  so I may have gotten some things wrong  I d like to read your opinions if that s the case   EDIT     w  also makes sense when you consider that the only person Armin seems to openly rely on is Eren  Armin doesn t seek support from any other person  not even Mikasa  except his bestie  so it s easy to say that Armin doesn t depend on anyone if you take him out of the equation  Only one person  but it still counts  You don t see that Armin constantly needs Eren because it s shown in a subtle way and Armin probably doesn t even realize it    You have moments like his speech to the Garrisons after Eren conviced him that he actually could  Armin felt awful after Floch told him to his face that he shouldn t be alive  but he lightens up a bit thanks to Eren reminding him of the sea  AND MANGA SPOILERS Armin being an emotional wreck  extremely depressed and angry when Eren goes away and makes it clear that he s no longer on his side  but he becomes confident when Eren s support comes back and he tells Armin that he is the one who will save humanity  although this happens in ch     where things are rushed and kind of weird so take this with a grain of salt    Don t be surprised if I change my vote lmao but I ll give it more thought ,infj
The main reason why Armin appears like a   is because he hasn t been respected his whole life and he s been an outsider in a dangerous world  but the important thing to realize here is that he sets up his own situation by staying attached to his dreams regardless of what people around him do  It just so happens that he has Eren and Mikasa who do end up supporting him  however he  won  their support by essentially being himself and not modifying his behavior   When you consider that he has basically just done his own thing his whole life  social support be damned  it does not make sense that he is a    He does not put effort into finding people he can rely on  he puts effort into figuring out how his dreams of a different world can come to fruition   And obviously he s not going to be  confident  in a military world given who he is but that doesn t make him a    In general the more intellectual types are generally not fast to react to the environment around them or comfortable commanding people on  because they see things complexly through a lot of nuance and greys rather than routine courses for immediate action  and a more decisive black and white mentality  When we see his actual decisions though  they are not  tried and proven  at all  They appear to come out of nowhere but completely original thought  and he does have a confidence that his reasoned out solutions are superior to  common sense   unlike a typical     However he he not actually   or   first  He is   first  He is primarily driven to change minds and see humanity move in a new direction  When you see in his own words what he considers it is primarily based on effect of actions  rather than understanding itself   and the question of what is the wrong or right action to take  He doesn t have the   ish cynicism of someone like Levi  but maintains hope that there is a way to live up to his ideals despite the world around him which makes it look impossible  This is also not the product of research  but rather the his drive to see his dreams through   Also his sense of duty is more generalized to an idea from which he receives nothing directly back from  other than that maybe in the end he will achieve his goal  however he is prepared to die for it without even seeing it in the end ,infj
Why melancholic dominant   He was very patient  stable  controlled  passive  calm and logical  He definitely has phlegmatic somewhere  either phlegmatic melancholic or melancholic phlegmatic   Why RCUAI btw  I can see RCOAI but i m not sure ,infj
can someone explain why he has   in his tritype instead of   ,infj
fontes  n o foi preciso  ,infj
i always thought he was phlegmatic  so i m voting mel phleg  idc,infj
can someone please give me an example of Ni don and Fe aux ,infj
Just a reminder that if you re voting  w  then you can t vote sp sx  He doesn t fit the sp  subtype at all ,infj
Can anyone explain the difference between Melancholic dominant and Melancholic Phlegmatic  James doesn t have choleric or sanguine traits  so he is one of these    He is obviously depressed  but does that instantly imply Melancholic dom ,infj
His main and really only parent child relationship is one of responsive parent and neutral child  Which is thought to produce a   enneagram based on the three law in enneagram  not a lot of people know about this  it actually makes a lot of sense     I think when he was initially voted a sp  w   people were right to be suspicious  but in terms of core fears  what enneagram is based off  he s not really any kind of   either  Actions wise yes    is definitely in his tritype  But his core fear is still incompetence  Not necessarily intellectually  but emotionally  this is the fear of the sx    which is a countertype  so they don t look like usual  s   He s not   or self preservation motivated  he s willing to put himself in pretty dangerous situations often if he really believes in it  That explains the counterphobic sx   wing  although sx  s often times are  w   and I wouldn t rule that out for him  Sx  s are usually more friendly than the other  s  but a trauma like what James went through subdued any expression at all  He s sx motivated through his need to feel something   His reasoning for believing he s a psychopath is due to his relative indifference towards a childhood trauma  but in reality it was a classic   coping mechanism of disconnecting to avoid being hurt  There s a misconception about E   and everyone seems to only associate sp   and  w  with it  We don t all hoard information like the sp    s core fear is really inadequacy above all  James  way of coping with his mom s death was distancing himself from it  because ultimately he could never process it emotionally ,infj
I get why people are voting him into because he thinks logically but most of the times he does the complete opposite ,infj
She has her own strong value system  Fi  and cares about facts  Te   INFJ where   And before someone replies saying  INFJs can also have values   read Jung s extraverted feeling feeler explanation ,infj
I don t have a formed opinion on her type but I want to point out something in favor of INFJ  INFJs are usually known for displaying high Fi  It s an Fe   Ti process  it may look instant and Fi like but it s actually rationalized   I think her shadow Fi is reflected a lot on the characters  and that could be because she planned the characters for a long time ,infj
how is this page higher on the debate chamber section than Zendaya,infj
I heard an INTP read the Harry Potter books outloud for long periods of time and and he stopped very frequently to point out how a certain thing doesn t make sense or is contradictory logically  I always understood his points  but at the same time it was visible that this type of consistency was ignored for the very sake of breaking limits of structure  to detach ourselves from reality and venture into the unknown and uncharted field of theoretical possibilities    Someone who sacrifices logical coherence to expand the limits of imagination and thus to build a richer and broader fantasy world is not Ti tertiary  but a high Ne user  Not an Si inferior  though  as the incorporation of standard fantasy elements that withstood the test of time were fairly frequent  Also  where she maintained consistency was within her own world  every piece of the setting having their proper  settled place across multiple books and stories   So if she s high in Ne  but not terribly low on Si  and lacks Ti almost entirely  what is she  That s right  INFP ,infj
She is an INFP  proof   Rowling   The wizards represent all that the  normal person  most fears  They are plainly outcasts and comfortable with being so   Rowling   Nothing is more unnerving to the truly conventional than the unashamed misfit   Rowling   Unlike any other creature on this planet  humans can     think themselves into other people s places    Ratio the INFJ test advocates ,infj
It s not a disdain towards the INFJ voters  but i think y all confuse Socionics Fe with MBTI Fe  I mean  i saw arguments that say she s Fe because she relies on ethics and objective morals  but it s not really how mbti s Fe works  That s socio Fi  she s a definite socionics Fi Ne,infj
Yes  Rowling is a Ni dominant type  But her judging functions  aka decision making ones  are not Fe and Ti  She uses Fi and Te  She processes moral standards individually  which is how Fi works  to create system to support those values  Te   An unhealthy INFJ would use Ti arguments to convince people of shared Fe values ,infj
Again as a Si dom myself the more I learn about cognitive functions  the less and less ISTJ makes sense  It seems like Si arguments stem from her past trauma  which doesn t hold much weight  Her Ni is plain as day in Frozen Fever and Frozen    Her two iconic songs are literally called  Let it Go  and  Into the Unknown   If she was Si dom she probably wouldn t chase the voice in F  as quickly as she decides to  I would sooner vote INTJ than ISTJ  but I agree with the posters below that her Fe is also pretty obvious  Also she very clearly uses Se ,infj
I think it s very clear she has very high Fe  Like  when she met Anna at the coronation    she wasn t really shy  but rather easily started and continued a conversation with her sister  despite spending most of her time alone and away from her  That is definitely high Fe  but she seems a lot more collected and quiet to be a Fe dom ,infj
I don t see how she could be ISTJ  especially considering her iconic song  Let It Go  included a lyric where she belts out  The pastt is in the pastttt   which is not an attitude you would expect from someone with Si high up in her function stack at all  Her primary focus across both movies  Frozen and Frozen II  is about what s coming next  and her character arcs tend to be about her travelling  into the unknown   which  stereotypically  is something ISTJs don t feel at all comfortable with  Thinking on what s coming next  like what will happen if she exposes her powers  what people will say  although she ends up not caring about that   where following the ethereal voice will take her  etc  etc  seems more like Ni dominance  Fe makes sense too because she spends the first half of her life worrying about how exposing her powers will make people feel  and putting that before her self values which eventually come out of their bottle several years later in Let It Go  In fact  it could be argued that much of her reaction to having to hide her powers strongly suggested a Ni Ti loop  something you won t get from an ISTJ  And she really does seem like an INFJ  not just because of stereotypes  she is emotional  sensitive  hides her problems  etc  but also just her entire demeanour across the franchise seems like behaviour you should expect from an INFJ ,infj
       Going to emphasize her Fe and Fe Ti mindset  again  from the fundamentals since certain arguments for Te and Fi essentially revolve around relating it to how pleasant unpleasant she is towards others  involving her willingness to cut herself off and her various manners of handling things more assertively forcefully  that s more her socio Se  or moralistically    core  think of Bishamon from Noragami  or Caitlyn from Arcane as I ve heard both ESI   core INFJs  even when      the first movie has her under great stress  and she does in fact attempt social tact before everything goes wrong Anna pushes her and hurts her to the point of lashing out  like initiating small talk with Anna to try to connect with her at the beginning of the party  or asking to talk to Anna about Hans alone as to not offend him        her attempts at keeping herself in and not reaching out was      for the sake of her environment  emphasized with a comparison to two other INFJs here    and the greater  value  demands placed on her to be good   her powers were continuing to grow  as the  nd movie also shows  too risky for her to even attempt to reach out  esp  with her trauma  and      second movie shows an abundance of Fe in the manner in which she tries to connect sentimentally with the spirits and the Northuldra  with an interpersonal  tactful  and ultimately collective focus when she takes on the hopes of them in freeing the forest and promises them something so visionary that others can t imagine what it would be like to have the forest freed      And even with Anna and Honeymaren at various moments           Definitions first  which will relate to the examples below      Te Fi decides for itself whether it s being ethical unethical  while Fe Ti must decide this by contextualizing oneself against an operative moral system or philosophy which they have often built themselves from observations of social causalities over time   but which they are also beholden to in a kind of third person sense        Myers    Fe  depends wholly upon the ideals  conventions  and customs of the environment    Finds value outside of the individual in the collective ideals of the community  which are usually accepted without question       Jung on Fe   The personality appears to be adjusted in relation to objective conditions  Her feelings correspond with objective situations and general values      Michael Pierce     If  feeling  is evaluation  assignment of value   good  or  bad    then extraverted feeling is evaluation divorced from the subject and remarried to objective factors  It will never trust its own subject to make evaluations  fearing the narrowness and selfishness of personal bias  It is not interested in what seems good to itself  but always in what is good for everyone else  collectively   their goodness is confirmed through external feedback  i e  through people s observable reactions     Contrary to extraverted feeling  introverted feeling is concerned with an internal harmony of feeling  Like introverted intuition  it is insulated from public opinion  A thing s meaning and value is based on nothing but the introverted feeler s own assessment  in accord with the nature of their own subject  hence  all of its rulings are unanimous  since there is only one voter  and to compromise on these rulings is to compromise themselves   Selling out  is the cardinal sin  ,infj
I find Tumblr MBTI typings inaccurate because they misrepresent functions  utilize behaviors  associate cognitive traits to the wrong functions  and many other reasons  Here is one that I encountered for Elsa that was used in an argument    https   mbtifiction com            elsa frozen ISTJ amp    Elsa is perpetually in a self made cage haunted by the past  Even after she professes to having  let it go  she s really still holding on to it   This is just trauma and can be anyone regardless of their MBTI   Elsa is afraid of what her people will think of her for being different and practices social graces with astute determination to try to hide it   This is not Si  in fact this is Fe  focus on external norms       She is often so detail oriented that she fails to recognize the big picture implications of current events as well as her own actions  For instance   freezing the entire kingdom goes beyond her notice because she s so focused in on the minute details of her own circumstance   This is not Si  this is an Se grip if anything   Jung  Impulsiveness and unrestraint are the characters of this sensation  combined with an extraordinary dependence upon the sense impression   She has the tendency to make assumptions about circumstances and people before she s reviewed all the evidence and to stick to those beliefs until undeniable evidence slaps her in the face   This is the opposite of Si Te  Si Doms do not assume first  they store detailed sensory impressions in distinct boxes and attempt to gather multiple perspectives through their inferior Ne to produce something definite  Through this  they attempt to carefully assess the actual details of the situation instead of assuming things  Ni Doms are the ones who make assumptions based off their intuition without necessarily having a lot of evidence to support it due to their inferior Se    She s not very good at understanding other people s motivations or emotions  thus her firm reluctance to ignore everything her sister says to try to convince her to come back   This is not true at all  Elsa literally tells Anna  I know  I know  you mean well but leave me be  Yes I m alone  but I m alone and free  Just stay away and you ll be safe from me    Elsa s intuitive side is rather weak  which is another reason I can t understand why people think she s INTJ   Her assumptions about people and situations under stress are not usually accurate   I do not believe that being an Ni Dom is about having accurate intuition  its intuition   a hunch by nature is prone to being incorrect  Its about her inclinations rather than her abilities as an individual ,infj
i don t really see VELF  isn t the whole premise of her character being unassertive because she has no sense of self volition  she s not initiating or productive  in fact she s afraid of being those things because she fears she ll step out of line  upset people or will prove herself against being a good queen  which is a role she didn t ever want in the first place    elsa initially ran away because she want to be relieved of responsibility  felt an immense amount of uncontrol  and was embarrassed  which sounds like an unsure passive  V  i also can t see ESI  ESI s are unyielding of negative emotional expression while EII is the opposite  I can also see Se polar over Ne polar   she s directly opposed to objectifying her surroundings into a concrete and consistent   it is what it is     idk i m new to socionics so i could be wrong   anyway    Enneagram   sp so  w      sp so  w      sp so  w   heheh they re all sp so   Big    RLOAN    |R|LoAi ,infj
I understand why people think she s a    but her being a self preservation   makes SO much more sense  She is struggling with shame and feelings of worthlessness  core struggles of the heart center   not so much with  repressed  anger  gut center   Sp  s are long sufferers  willing to endure their own pain and suppressing their feelings   conceal don t feel    hoping that they will be loved for their sacrifice and for not complaining about their suffering   don t let them know    They want to avoid being a burden at all cost  That s pretty much her character arc  just listen to her songs  She never wants to burden Anna with her problems  suffers on her own  while still craving to be loved  even though she fears that she s undeserving of it because of her dangerous and strange powers   Additionally  her whole journey in the second movie was to find her purpose  the meaning behind her powers  a journey to discover who she is and what her real identity is  which are exactly the questions a   ask themself all the time  Elsa may not look like this enneagram on first glance  but there is no type that fits her better than a self preservation   ,infj
Throughout Frozen  Elsa s Ni is more visible than her Si  This is evident in the song  Into the Unknown  where Elsa questions if there is some greater purpose for her out there instead of establishing an inner sense of stability    are you someone out there who s a little bit like me  who knows deep down  I m not where I m meant to be   Elsa ponders that there is something out there that extends beyond her experiences and speculates an outcome of there being a better state beyond her current one  The guidebook also addresses a similar mindset    Maybe there s magic outside of Arendelle  Am I where I m meant to be  It feels like there s something missing for me here  Is there somewhere else where I d make more sense    The same theme is evident at the end of Frozen   because of how Elsa willingly and easily abandons her role as Queen of Arendelle to serve a greater purpose and join the Northuldra  In her place  an Si Dom would be more hesitant and consider all the negative outcomes of the new lifestyle and sudden change  On the other hand  Elsa shows little hesitation and remembers that she promised to do what was the best for her people  She says   Fortunately I know exactly what that thing is   glancing at Anna  letting her be queen       This means that Elsa did not have any personal attachment to her role as Queen and was only fulfilling to please the people of Arendelle  something guided by the collective and a higher principle   Note what Michael Pierce says here about Fe Ti and Te Fi  which Claire used before   Te Fi    Originates within the individual  a burning fire or personal loyalty  a part of the ISTJ s identity that they must strive to affirm   fulfilling routines or responsibilities because of an ingrown loyalty  Fe Ti    Sense of duty is a higher principle outside of the individual fulfilling responsibilities because their truth and worth has been confirmed   outer sense of duty  often directed towards the welfare of others  The song  into the unknown  can be argued for an inferior Ne argument  I m afraid of what I m risking if I follow you   However  toward the middle of the song she says  don t you know there s a part of me that longs to go  into the unknown   She then recklessly follows the ball of light without any caution and accidentally releases the spirits  This similar recklessness upsets Anna  an Ne Si user  who tells her  you re not being careful   Furthermore  an Ne grip argument does not apply to Elsa in Frozen   because grips occur when the character is unhealthy  if anything  Elsa was extremely healthy in Frozen   and her following the voice in her head would be her natural state ,infj
In Frozen    the explanation to Elsa s behaviour in the dangerous journey is because she was in an inferior Ne grip    First  this is what a grip means    In the Grip  is when a person gets out of their natural personality type and into a state of their inferior function  which is usually predetermined by stress factors  making these people act differently then they normally would as a result of a high stress environment  in this case the high stress environments are the dangerous journey where she had to face the forest spirits in Frozen   or after she fled the castle to the mountains when her powers were discovered in Frozen      Here is what an inferior Ne grip looks like according to this book  Was that Really Me   by Naomi L  Quenk    Can read it here too      When they experience a gradual slide into their inferior function  Introverted Sensing types may become uncharacteristically spontaneous  sometimes to the point of later judging themselves irresponsible and reckless     One ISFJ reported giving in to the urge to leave work in the middle of the day and go to the movies  An ISTJ made a spur of the moment decision to buy a new computer before thoroughly researching the options  He returned the computer later  assessing the purchase as rash and foolish     the examples sound like Elsa  who gave in to the desire to follow the voice Into the Unknown  and the uncharacteristic decisions Elsa made in situations far dangerous than in the castle like wanting to follow the Earth elementals in the spur of the moment    Also  Elsa is always focusing on the negative possibilities in the future  Like all the negative possibilities of how she could hurt Anna again in the future  or all the ways she could lose control of her powers in the future and hurt everyone around her  And that is inferior Ne  It is in contrast to inferior Se of INJs  who become overwhelmed by negative realities in the present  For example  if Elsa had inferior Se  she would have struggled with controlling the fire in the forest as she would be overwhelmed by the negative present situation  instead of being able to assert great spontaneous control of the present danger   which she did    In its full blown state  inferior Extraverted Intuition anticipates all the catastrophes that might happen in an unsafe  threatening world and focuses on dire possibilities in the future   Remember that the other Introverted perceiving types  the Introverted Intuitive types  focus on negative realities in the present      I think others have also made cases of how Elsa showed inferior Ne in Frozen   and   so I don t want to repeat or go into other evidences for Elsa s inferior Ne for now  But I want to also say that I think Si users can at times be closed off to considering other angles and possibilities especially when their Ne is not developed or used unhealthily  I also want to share links for some sources that argue that Elsa is an ISTJ      MBTI notes         Fictional Character MBTI and further discussions         Funky MBTI in fiction       The Book s Addict Guide to MBTI      Youtube Channel RealMBTI  by an ISTJ   ,infj
         I ll try to make a point with the feedback from a PDB  Most likely  page  which has ISTJ as its consensus  that Elsa s approach in the second movie was wholly more of a Ni dom s than a Si dom s   https   www personality database com profile           But the gist of why this is for her cognitive processing is that in situations far more dangerous than in her castle  with a higher potential for things to go wrong  she s pretty much tunnel visioning forward with a certainty  due to Ni s more  dogmatic  way of fixating on an ideal potential further ahead  and optimism in her methods that even puts Anna off  who constantly presents alternative possibilities to the one Elsa seeks as possible  bad  outcomes only to be mostly disregarded  Ni  inf Ne   Plus  in pursuit of this  pushing to the point of disregarding her environment and physical state  which Anna chides her for  inf Se       The Si dom would be conscientious of securing the individual steps of the process from all angles  inf Ne informing all the negative possibilities to be conscientious on   while the Ni dom would more often focus on the ideal they envision at the end as the thing pulling them forward to manifest  leading them to be more sloppy  in comparison  in the actual process  especially after a strong realization of what could be waiting at the end  They want to pick one ideal possibility and stick to making it a reality    Edit  Here s another link that emphasizes how an ISTJ themselves would experience inf Ne  which you really don t see as Elsa s cognitive process in the second movie on the journey                        Now some select posts from that page contrasting Ni vs Si  don t heed the INTJ comparison  I ll elaborate on why INFJ   INTJ below  but if you were to pick one of the IxTJs  INTJ makes the most sense       One of the major  side effects  of having dominant Ni is massive delusional optimism magical thinking and thinking that everything you touch is going to go brilliantly  in fact  that s an extremely strong  tell  that someone is an  immature  INxJ  Well developed Ni doms  particularly those with auxiliary Te  can counteract this tendency to an extent  but as others have pointed out it s the ISxJs  with their inferior Ne  who are the masters of the contingency plan      Ni dom has one plan and believes it will work  Ne inf has infinite plans and still goes  What if none of them work     so there you have it      The thing is  while INTJs are also prone to do that  they are generally  broadly convinced their plans WILL work no matter what  so they focus on one plan at a time  only to realize it never goes the way they predicted  sighs   ISTJs  on the other hand  have a more concrete grasping on pratical matters that allow them to backup a n ary set of plans in case something goes wrong  Reality is harsh on intuitives      Here they ask what the type most likely to have a BACK UP plan for EVERYTHING  This is Ne inferior rather than Ni Dom  which is more focused towards a single path of action towards a certain goal  Ne inferior is literally preparing for all the bad possibilities that could happen  which is what the poll is asking   more examples below  skip to the third part if you get the gist ,infj
something about them    ,infj
ESTP ESEs HMUU       w   w  work either way mwah mwah,infj
i ve seen far too many healthy fictional ESTJs and met too many irl ones who were absolutely hilarious and inspirational  to not be head over heels by now   ik it s not universally true  but the idea of someone s love language being hard work and planning for your sake     hello    ,infj
Glad I am not the only one who agree on this   INFJ are the best partner  generous  compassionate  logical  down to earth  but also imaginative  future oritentied however is also detail orientied    The downside is you easily hurt them  so we have to be as kind as possible to them as well    Another down side is when dealing with unhealthy INFJ  they can plot a murder and still get away with it     But overall  INFJ men and women are the best partner  They are compatiable with many types since they can tap into person value and motiavtion and gain understanding from it ,infj
INFJ INFP ENFP ENTP xSFJ  all the others in any order  Enneagram                   ,infj
I m kind of a sucker to intensity so i would like a partner who is very intense  so SEE is the best for socionics maybe EIE second but idk  Enneagram wise                    I might prefer sp   as a second choice to enneagram   The act of aiming to be the best without trying to boast about it is just admirable   They might even help me with consciense,infj
I wanna date me,infj
Same as me but more extraovert and confident  I just love ENTP  and my favourite characters from books movies are ENTPs,infj
This page is so cute  lol  i just read the comments and everyone is so passionately talking about their love interests and romantic desires and for some reason it just made me so happy   ,infj
I thought he was an ENTP before watching Loki  just now got around to coming back to change my vote after rewatching Thor Ragnarok and Thor  the dark world because every time he drops his self defense act he s so clearly INFJ,infj
If we talk about Loki from the comic books  especially at the beginning of his stories with Thor in the   s  without a doubt he is an ENTP  But talking about him at MCU  well  I think he s a very evident Ni Dom  very oriented towards the future and his plans  but he focuses more on one purpose  one focus  one plan  Ni  than multiple possibilities for the at the same time  Ne   he in the first film of the Avengers is evident his Ni Ti loop   Besides that his Fe is very strong to be tertiary or inferior  he always wants to prove to others his sovereignty and how powerful he is  His inferior Se is very sharp  he acts very aggressive and anxious when he doesn t know how to deal with something or when his plans fail  that scene of him drunk in episode    of his series is a beautiful example of an Se grip  ,infj
His Fe manipulation is similar to Hitler s  don t you think ,infj
The whole   villain thing   of Loki s is a mask that he accepted since he was recognized as the one who brings destruction and chaos  His personality on the outside is a mask  bc we know that he is a very good liar  But in the series  we see the character of Loki in very much dept  seeing that his choices of life were made by what he thought was his mission and uniqueness in life  and then he get himself making all these questions about existence and realizing what he didn t know before  He doesn t only desire to rule because he wants the power of ruling  but because he thought that it was what he was supposed to be   The mischief God  The Destroyer  The Ruler    which is the whole point of his series  If we analyze his character in much much dept we ll see that he is an INFJ  w  after all ,infj
i get how he can be INFJ in thor   and thor  the dark world  as well as avengers  i mean  who even knows what his personality was when he was mind controlled   and endgame  the appearances are too short to type him anyway   but his appearance in infinity war is too short and contradictory to type him and in thor  ragnarok he isn t INFJ at all  and then the show made his character completely incosistent  don t get me wrong  i liked his character in the show  it was closer to the comics  as well as the one in the movies  it was easier for me to understand   but those two just aren t the same and it was while i was watching the show that i gave up on trying to determine one ultimate mbti for him  because it s just impossible ,infj
One more vote for INFP and I m waiting for someone on my side and have some good arguments about his not so adored Fe  but he uses it a lot  don t get me wrong   no Se passions in his decisions  I once thought about Te but    I think it s a nope for  I don t even want the throne    times  yes  he s ambitious but on occasion,infj
I voted him INFJ since episode    I knew it by just seeing his non verbal reactions  By just the literal expressions on his face man  It was also the time when people seemed skeptical and voted him ENTP  Now that the whole first season is out  I rest my case  Lol,infj
lets get real  its pretty obvious he s an INFJ   i can see where people are getting their assumptions  mostly ENTP because he does act generally like one  being chaotic etc but common sense guys  ITS A MASK  A FACADE  quite a lot of INFJs actually mask themselves  especially unhealthy ones  i think the problem with mbti is that it s all about sharing information about stereotypical  healthy types  so i m blaming mbti content for not educating enough about unhealthy types  and instead just talking about healthy types with grips and loops   loki from a young age has craved attention  that s literally his whole desire  his whole reason for his identity  hence enneagram    and   for being dramatic and wanting recognition  HE S LABELLED THE GOD OF MISCHIEF   thats where he takes his identity from  unhealthy INFJs when it comes to the last straw of wanting something  like attention  can become the opposite of who they are  not caring how people view them anymore  as long as they get that attention that they wanted from the beginning   speaking from experience     he s been told as a kid that he wouldn t rule no matter how hard he tried  plus being with thor  who s the opposite type  ESTP  is frustrating  this is also a reason for why he craves attention and perhaps acts like a supposed  ENTP  due to being in a grip  in the films  especially the avengers  he s in a lot of stress  meaning he s most likely in a grip or loop  therefore explaining his erratic behaviour  HE S JUST TIRED AND HE S SHOWING HIS SHADOW FUNCTIONS i dont understand how people cant see that  his ni is very visible  although unhealthy  HE S NOT A QUICK THINKER  he has to thoroughly make plans  ne users don t like to be stuck in one place for TOO LONG  whereas loki s biggest desire is to rule and that s always remained his no  priority and  purpose  on which he wants to do forever  HE HAS A TUNNEL VISION  refusing to branch out on other views  quoting from the series  from sylvie saying that lokis are destined to lose   we always survive  come on ENTPs wouldn t have that  hes also sarcastic and metaphorical due to his ni  especially in the series  love is a dagger   he s a SOCIAL CHAMELEON and a PEOPLE PLEASER  also i think some people forget that everyone has ni AND ne it just depends on which is prominent  of course he also has ne but ni is wayyy more used   his fe  very unhealthy  healthy INFJs with fe strive to help people  loki  however  is sick of helping people due to being misunderstood and being seen as the  underdog  to thor  he uses his fe to MANIPULATE AND READ PEOPLE  from the second you see him in thor you can see he s good at convincing and lying to people  this is a popular aspect of unhealthy INFJs  like eurus holmes who also manipulates people in order to get control and attention to satisfy their self esteem  and the reason for him to be so self absorbed though is due to his unhealthy enneagram    not because of fi at all   definitely uses ti  organises his manipulation and plans  he uses precise wording to get what he wants  perfectionistic  wants to be efficient and if that doesnt go to plan  he becomes very frustrated  it drives him to find and uncover the truth   se  inferior hence  sensory indulgements like drinking  dancing and admitting to being hedonistic  he s a dreamer  an idealist  and sometimes his realizations don t match up with the reality that he s creating in his mind  seeing everyone voting ENTP just shows how shallow some peoples understanding is of him and mbti  let alone something like INTP  ENTJ or INTJ  ENFJ  okay closer  but ni is definitely more prominent in my opinion  his glorious purpose  and his sensory indulgments are equal to inferior se  just because he likes talking doesn t mean he s an extrovert  quite a lot of the time he fades into the background too  and INFJs are usually ambiverts  underneath and on the outside he displays MANY INFJ traits aswell as needing CONTROL which exceeds any other types  needs for it  such as ENTPs  and i think we re all forgetting hes MISUNDERSTOOD because mythology has painted him wrong  if he was an ENTP  wouldnt he be sort of in his true element and understood because ENTPs kinda want to be seen in that way  bit sus  literally only where a loki is an ENTP is president loki or comic loki  you can feel that they are ENTPs and feel the difference between them and the real loki  i stg if theres another ENTP vote after this   anyways  i didn t mean to write a whole essay but some people just can t see it  just because hes humorous and chaotic doesnt mean he s automatically an ENTP  get it right ,infj
I watched two thor movies so far and I don t see Fe in him he is most likely an unhealthy type whatever he is but from what I understood is he seeks attention in power and to rule as revenge I don t think it s what an INFJ would desire,infj
I don t think Chrollo is totally RCOEI  I see both E and A in him ,infj
How s Chrollo an EIE  Or even an INxJ or ISTP for that matter  He s as lively and emotionless as a corpse  sitting comfortably at HQ  reading and socializing with the other troupe members  There are instances where he does the opposite  but that is not the norm for this character  He also only really moves when he has to and lacks long term goals  which indicates a lack of Se Ni but a great amount of Ne Si    He doesn t appear to have Te either  as suggested by the INTJ votes  If he does  it s either very weak or not prominent a function at all  Just about the only kind of order he s concerned with is with the numbering of the members    He has Ti  however  which should ve been obvious from his controversial view about Judas and his own understanding on the meaning of the word betrayal  Ne as well from his curiosity about things  particularity with the objects he steals and the motives of others  along with his readiness to see and accept things from others  perspective    If my assessment of the character s personality is correct  that should narrow down the vote to xNTP  Since Ne is more apparent to me than Ti  I m voting ENTP  So sx also because he s most concerned with his group  even over his own life ,infj
can someone also explain EIE I just want to understand,infj
can someone explain me his ni ,infj
I feel like I am going to get a lot of downvotes for this  but I really feel like he is INTJ with a very well developed Ti  I m really stuck between INFJ and INTJ since he has no Ne  It s been a while since i last watched hunter x hunter but I just can t see Fe aux  If you are going to downvote  please explain it first thanks ,infj
He was a mysterious character  had an observant nature  was generally calmly observed and did not socialize very much  and although she was quite strong  he did not have a narcissistic appearance ,infj
Chrollo is so sp   Social    https   www personalitycafe com threads social fives according to beatrice chestnut           For Social Fives  the passion of avarice is connected to knowledge  These Fives don t need the nourishment relationships provide because their passion for knowledge somehow compensates for what they might get from direct human contact  It s as if they have an intuition that they can find everything they need through the mind  Needs  for people and for emotional sustenance  get displaced into a thirst for knowledge     The name given to this subtype is  Totem   which communicates their need for  super ideals   or the need to relate to people who share their intellectual values  interests  and ideals  The image of a totem suggest both height and a character that is constructed  like an object  rather than a human being  These Fives do not relate to regular people in everyday life  they relate to easily idealized experts who share their ideals  to people who display what they see as outstanding characteristics based on shared values and knowledge and who they can keep at a certain distance  One Social Five I know says he  collects people  who share his interests and values     Social fives are looking for the ultimate meaning in life  motivated by an underlying  potentially unconscious  sense that things are meaningless unless the ultimate meaning is found  This Five s drive to find the extraordinary underscores a polarity they may perceive between extraordinariness and meaninglessness  They look for meaning to avoid a fearful sense that the world is meaningless  but in their search for meaning they orient themselves so much toward finding the quintessence of life  the extraordinary  that they may become disinterested in everyday life  They see a gap between the ideal and everyday life  and they burn in the longing for the ultimate meaning  For this five  motivated by the social instinct in the service of avarice  the common  ordinary self does not have enough value to satisfy their drive for meaning    Self preservation     Very protective of personal space and privacy  this type sets clear limits and boundaries and is very comfortable living a relatively solitary life with just a few close friends  They would much rather observe social life than participate in it  Often truly introverted  they prefer not to reveal much of their inner self  finding it difficult to lower their guard for fear of losing their privacy or sense of safety     Database page Sp      Psychologically  and sometimes physically   SP s build thick walls to protect themselves from the world and from other people  This personality is the clearest expression of the archetype of isolation and introversion  They have a need to be able to hide behind boundaries they can control  and to know they have a place of safety they can retreat to  in order to avoid feeling lost in the world  In focusing on finding shelter  they learn to survive inside walls   and they want to have everything inside those walls so that they don t have to venture out into the world  To them  the external world can seem hostile  inadequate  and brutal          ,infj
not really disagreeing  but why core    I havent watched yorknew in awhile but from what I remember that just doenst fit  Again  this could be a obvious typing and my memory is just failing me but still,infj
Why is Chrollo Phlegmatic Melancholic instead of Melancholic Phlegmatic ,infj
chrollo isn t INTP that s for sure,infj
I think the main issue with this typing is the obvious misunderstanding of the enneagram    due to Riso and Hudson s  interpretation   more like complete inconsistent makeover  of the enneagram the image and idea of the enneagram   has been portrayed as a giving caring mother archetype  but this could not be further from the truth  The Social   is very different to this  caring mother  image    he must be able to seduce the social environment  becoming a group seducer  a distinguished being and  perhaps  not only someone superior  but with a gift of leadership    Now to anyone who has studied their history  they would know the Nazi propaganda schemes were blatantly obvious social seduction  The Volkswagen  Peoples car  promising workers a free car  the  Strength through joy  program promising workers that they will get to go on free vacations and to concerts from working   Hitler used many different types of social seduction to gain popularity and brainwash the Germans  to the point he built a sex appeal  in wish he profited off with postering photos of his face as advertisement  literally just his face with bold text above saying  HITLER   this is the epitome of the social    brainwashing and blatant emotional manipulation   Here is a summary of Claudio Naranjo s Social     SO     Omnipotence  cold  egocentric  demanding and hypercritical  contemptuous  rebellious and tyrannical  intolerant of limits  intolerant of criticism  competitive  hunger for success and blindness to failure  envious   Now to anyone who understands the pride and ambition of the    especially the social    they would clearly see how Hitler fit into this    If you win  you need not have to explain   If you lose  you should not be there to explain    And I can fight only for something that I love  love only what I respect  and respect only what I at least know    If you want to shine like sun first you have to burn like it     Anyone can deal with victory  Only the mighty can bear defeat      Adolf Hitler  Now you can see Hitler had a very strong sense of pride  ambition  and drive    Contrasting Hitler s behaviour to Joseph Stalin  a Sexual Six  who was a paranoid  stoic  irrational and obsessive leader    In speech the passion and emotion of the social   thrives   Adolf Hitler Speech    Joseph Stalin Speech    as you can see Adolf Hitler shows passionate emotion and raw hyperbole in his speech  while joseph Stalin remains stoic the entire time   In the social two  the passion of pride manifests itself as a satisfaction in the conquest of the public  It may be that to awaken to a great passion it is not necessary to develop much intelligence  or to show it  but a social two could never be enough to be considered a silly blonde  A social two needs to be someone  and in order to be someone you need to use your mind more  Being a person who wants to be important in order to feed his pride  he must be able to seduce the social environment  becoming a group seducer  a distinguished being and  perhaps  not only someone superior  but with a gift of leadership ,infj
Oml  wtf guys he is such an obvious ENTP E he talked N  N stands for Nazi T he thought things  so thinker P p stands for playing with Comrade Stalin  Now serious part his attitudunal psyche   V  Confident  ruling with willpower and iron fist  Often domineering and controlling  F Hitler was very aware of the physical world around him   t s said that he could bath    times a day and generally cared a lot about his health  L despite being very meticulous  thorough and methodical  Hitler often gave an unnleash to his intuition and just went with what he felt was right  Ay the end  his variois tactical flaws caused him a defeat by Stalin  E Hitler didn t care much about emotions at all  Intense and passionate at the first glance  Hitler was a hardcore materialist and didn t care about moral consequences of his actions  He also belived that anything is worth the final result  and raging emotional speeches were only a tool in his hands,infj
For the people saying that he s INFJ because he has dominant Ni  do I need to remind you that INTJ has the same  As a INFJ myself  I just can t understand how an F would be so cruel  especially because INFJ are highly empaths  an F would never murder million without feeling a sense of remorse  I understand that unhealthy INFJ can be really cruel  I lived a horrible period in my life that I don t even want to remember  but never in my mind I thought of hurting others  I understand that us INFJ have set values and ideas that cannot be changes but never at the cost of others life ,infj
   He approached towards the crowd through empathy  He believed he was genuinely doing the good thing for everyone  He was really really wrong  but his tactics were Fe  Just because he was a dictator who committed mass murder doesn t make him a thinker or a Fi user  This also makes him close to SLOAI than SLOEI   Not saying that SLOEI is really off though  considering what he have done       Why            I see unhealthy sexual four traits  he had a strong desire to have his own identity  Well  he had an interest in art  and he was strongly discouraged when not many people appreciated his paintings  Despite the little success  he continued to paint throughout his life  And he found an another path for himself and that was unfortunately dictatorship ,infj
I see a higher use of Ni  but can someone explain inferior Se ,infj
I don t understand where is Fe aux ,infj
how is he a feeling type ,infj
The way he treated his mistresses and the way he treated and manipulated people was very ENFJ ,infj
Can someone explain why  fix ,infj
She got so many ENFJ and INFJ votes that might turn her into FeFeTiTi,infj
bro her Fe is insane  her primary desire to mold the external world around her values morals is her main determining factor in practically every decision she makes  wheres the primary focus on intuition patterns abstract ideas    ps fe isn t emotional empathy or harmony  its about values rather than emotions ,infj
Dany is an INFJ  an unhealthy one at that but understandably so  the latter seasons really showed the contrast between Westeros and Dany and her people  Anyway im going to try to make more sense than this first sentence   Her apparent FE is shown in how she could have at any turn acted mercilessly and put everyone in their place for not obeying her every command but she acted mercifully to the degree where she let Jon  Tyrion and many others choose for her for what she knew deep down wasnt right  She tried to meet others needs first as we see when she agrees to fight against the Night King beside the North before hers is satisified  She didnt forcefully make anyone submit at least not the ones closest to her and if so it was for a vision greater than the moment  an apparent and high use of NI    I believe she did see a greater world  unlike any had ever lived albeit betrayal  paranoia caused by the ones closest to her defying her in her state of vulnerability  countless deaths of her loved ones and being misunderstood as to who she is  evil enemy instead of good helpful queen  did make her spiral into madness  But  what INFJ can truly blame her for that  All the buttons were pushed and she spiralled    Her lack of SE is what really takes it home for me aswell  even at the last scenes where Jorah Mormont gives his life for her  we never see here really fight  we see her think  we see her silently strategizing  TI   we see her use her FE and speak with her NI but she is not a physical person  moreso when she needs to be and uses props and other people more than her own two hands to duel  fight or spar    Her being an INFJ became more apparent once she turned mad  at least for me  look at Hitler  INFJ  saying   Nietzsche     doesn t have the same crystal clear understanding as Schopenhauer   or Trotsky s  INFJ  quote about himself   My life was rather full of  adventures   However  by natural inclination  I have nothing in common with seekers after adventure      I like and appreciate discipline and system    Dany was thrust into this world by greedy men  Dany rose and swore to do it different  and she did  until she became a greedy woman  We are all bound by fate  Dany wanted to change hers  as does Loki  as did Hitler  as did Gandhi  What all these people have in common is one thing  how they used their cognitive functions    This is partly why I believe Dany is an INFJ  but of course  I can be wrong and I m open to have my mind changed with enough evidence  But as of now  i believe this ,infj
The slow descent of an unhealthy INFJ with a god complex  Attached to a vision to such a degree that she gets thrown into an Ni Ti loop when it doesn t go her way  TV Dany s Fe function has no real warmth in it  Literally  unless you re doing what she wants you get a      ton of nauseating insincerity  and if you see through that  she becomes brittle and violent ,infj
I understand the confusion of votes from ENFJ vs  INFJ  but people voting ISFP doesn t make any sense and just shows that people can t see a Fe user character with an identity they associate with Fi  Daenerys is an obvious user of Fe and this is even clearer in her final scene with Jon Snow   Jon Snow  Fi user  goes against the violent attitudes of Daenerys for going against his principles that during the series it is observed that the impunity of innocents affects him  Daenerys is extremely objective  Fe  and tells Jon that this was the only way to rebuild a society that was really  good  in its own right  Your sense of identity is closely linked to your achievements and positive changes in other people and in the world   The principle of individuality does not exist in this character  his values are closely aligned with the collectivity  Building for years a group in which he could fight together to get the throne   inclusion   Breaking Chains   and the connection between people   Her wanting something for herself is not an argument for Fi  Fe users may also want their own achievements  stop stereotypes    Spoiler  Even the final scene is a perfect tie between the Fe principles and the Fi principles  Jon Snow ends up killing Daenerys for this  The difference between your functions acting here is very clear ,infj
INFJ in the first four seasons  when Dan   Dave were still going by the books  ENFJ in the last four seasons  when they started reworking the roles to make them resemble the actors ,infj
Guys you can already making her both   ENFJ   INFJ       But How    Let me explain this to you  If we vote Daenerys as an INFJ and then Turn her socionics to EIE  ENFJ    everything will be solved      Her dominant function Is Ni   I couldn t even Imagine Fe as her dominant function      I think Ni   Fe   Ti   Se suits her perfectly,infj
I am going with INFJ  Mostly cause during the earlier seasons  it closely followed the books which showed a Ni Fe Daenerys which is what I saw on TV and in books  It s not until the later seasons  that the writers began making Daenerys not act the usual way  but even then she still had Ni Fe moments   Then again I do accept arguments for ENFJ cause I can see that from time to time   Of course  then season   happened  the season every character forgot their personality and brains ,infj
I m a bisexual and an INFP  w  like how     lmao,infp
In theory but not in practice  Pray for me,infp
Hmm yeah  its confusing,infp
hi gay  are u gay  me too  ,infp
i m so confused about my sexuality  honestly  i ve never had genuine romantic feelings towards anyone before  and if i  did   it was just a short obsession  but i still find feel kinda physically attracted to both men and women though,infp
The only thing I don t like about our community is the fact that some girls  usually on tiktok  will claim to be bi and proceed to gag at the thought of dating a boy like bruh  also dang that s a lot of ENFP bisexuals,infp
Being bisexual is extremely comforting  Guys are attractive  women are attractive  if you re attractive idc what gender you are  If you re hot  you re hot  End of discussion  And the validity of bisexuality like     women and     men  Still bisexual      men and     women  Still bisexual  Like damn it s pretty fly    to be bi  It s pretty cool  to be bisexual    ,infp
I m not even sure of my sexuality  I feel attracted to both genders but I ve never had genuinely loved any of my previous partners  Never tried dating a guy before but I ve had a relationship with a girl whom I d type an INFP  She would get bored easily and wouldn t really have patience  She also seemed to care about our relationship more than I did ,infp
just realized  D  a week ago  although I do have a preference for ladies    edit  I realized I was lesbian,infp
Ne doms are so indecisive they can t even pick a gender to be attracted to smh             ,infp
daydreaming about things i ll never experience woohoo  D,infp
awesome,infp
Way too kuch daydreaming is what I do,infp
literally constantly,infp
I remember my teacher said if I daydream it means I am slowly being taken by satan like wtfff     ,infp
This thing ruined my life  i wish i can be free from this issue someday   ,infp
Triple imagnative with double withdrawn and Fi Ne is just a perfect combo to always be daydreaming ,infp
a lot  actually  i could be on the beach or at the park and id rather day dream instead of enjoying myself,infp
as an ISFP  i daydream a lot  but usually it s about things about the future and things i want to happen  i imagine myself in future situations that can will happen  and when i come across the situation in real life  i act just like I dreamed  lol,infp
Im doing it now as I m writing this,infp
I played ddlc plus and went her route  she is NOT an INFP  Trust me she s an INFJ,infp
Shes typed as a     yet her enneagram is still  w   The  w  votes need to start coming in sooner ,infp
is it possible she could be ILI  I get that she wants to express herself through poetry  but it seems like it s more because she s an INFP sx w  than because she has creative fe  it s a private thing  she mostly wants to express herself through her poems for herself  to write down how she feels  mbti fi   she also just wants to be understood by somebody  sx  wanting to express itself and connect with others   she doesn t show much outward emotional expression  expressions  tone  etc  and even seems to be anxious bad with it  which causes a lot of her shyness and self esteem issues  she shows that she is jealous of people who can express themselves so easily and control their expression  feeling insecure and incapable    creative te could also explain why some people see her as an INTJ  it seems like a better fit than creative fe  she is very knowledgeable and concerned with evidence efficiency  shown when she fought with natsuki   unvalued fi is also a bit weird because she is shown worrying about whether she is acting inappropriately or not  she actually does tend to act inappropriately when she fails to contain her excitement   d fe  d fi   and regrets it immediately  unvalued fe  valued fi   she is very focused on maintaining good manners and close connections with others rather than a positive emotional atmosphere  she even gets a bit annoyed with sayori s big displays of fe    not to use this as evidence but she reminds me a lot of tamaki amajiki  an INFP ILI who was mistyped as IEI for a while  they re both very anxious with outward emotional expression despite being in tune with their emotions  as fi doms  they both value personal bonds and manners over emotional atmosphere  they are both efficient and able to analyze things nicely  despite not being very logical ,infp
Have you all seen Nana  She reminds me a lot of Miu  who was also typed as an INFP but then changed to INTJ  She could be seen as an INFP because her Fi is just too present  but the Ni dominance is very clear  especially when she talks about her writing  She is a  jumper  because she is in a Ni Fi loop  which can be explained by her mental illness  I don t see Ne  I barely see Si  and Te inferior  How  Her Te is also very present in my opinion ,infp
Sorry  but for me she has a ti  obviously ,infp
I have no clue how this character is still so badly mistyped after all these years  but I m tired  Yuri is INFJ   https   www youtube com watch v  vbUBkSxdxw route gameplay used for analysis   Her Ni shows in her interests  goal oriented mindset  and that unhealthy  unhealthy obsession with MC in her route which is Ni with inferior Se at its finest  by JUNG s Ni description    But if  through a forced exaggeration of the conscious attitude  a complete subordination to the inner perception should develop  the unconscious becomes an opposition  giving rise to compulsive sensations whose excessive dependence upon the object is in frank conflict with the conscious attitude  The form of neurosis is a compulsion neurosis  exhibiting symptoms that are partly hypochondriacal manifestations  partly hypersensibility of the sense organs and partly  and this is the important part  compulsive ties to definite persons or other objects    And her Fe is extremely evident  We re introduced to her picking a book MC might like  She is concerned with the club s harmony just as much as Monika  and Monika goes to her when she needs help communicating with members  She gets pretty annoyed at Sayori  Fi user   when she puts her in socially unfavourable situations  like helping her ask MC for lunch money  She s not comfortable with asserting her emotions and regrets it when it happens  seeing it as something wrong  she needs MC to accept them  The contrast with the other Fi users in the story is stark  I would love to know how Fi ever came out in this poll   There is no explanation for her for a NeSi axis  Why was she voted INFP  Because she s shy and reads books  Jesus  And don t come tell me she s in a loop  She doesn t get unhealthy until Monika fiddles with her  but Ne is nowhere in sight from the start ,infp
I m considering ISFP but idk  Does anyone have an argument for or against ISFP specifically ,infp
Scrap that  nevermind what I said before  She in fact is INFJ  let me explain   Ni   She s focused on abstract  and goal oriented as much as I think Monika had a big influence on her behavior I can t completely scrap it  She s pretty stubborn and as shown in a story hidden in her files   a brilliant planner  She s very calm and stoic   just like many other ni doms  Fe   at first I was considering fi because I definitely can see it  but then  nor high or low te makes any sense with her  let me explain her fe  using her poetry style  It s very expressive and emotionally deep  it makes you feel something  Yuri s relationship with mc and other club members showcases her fe even more  she wants everyone to feel good  a true peace maker  highly valuing feelings of people around her  Bringing tea to clubmates  reading with her love interest   Low Ti   she uses her ti  she has her own way of understanding world around her  Prolly the function I can t nicely argument but others make sense  Inferior se   oh that s a perfect match for our gloomy yuri  Cut of the reality  in her own world  can t understand physical sensations  or as I would say it   understands them in a very twisted way  Not impulsive unless in great stress   Old comment  Yuri during act   was def INFP but in act   She s more like an xnfj  prolly because of the fact that it wasn t actually her but Monika controling her,infp
I see Melancholic but why not Melancholic Phlegmatic   I m honestly stuck between the two ,infp
I honestly dont understand how people like her ,infp
Can someone tell me a time where she used Ne ,infp
i m so glad she s  w  now just because someone is depressed doesn t automatically make them a   core and there s not a single drop of   in her so the   wing made no sense   w  fits way better,infp
I fought for the longest time to convince everyone she was a  w  but  it s time we confront her  w ness   rip  w   i was so sure    There is a lens to see her through  before wandavision  where her actions can seem selfish minded  Type four in the sense of  nobody understands me  because she didn t understand herself and her power  Plus all the unprocessed grief of her parents  pietro  and vision made her really turbulent    Especially after watching WV  though  you can see that all wanda wants is family  sure  she s unstable  but she created an alternate reality where her family can be together and she can protect them   w    When she and vision say some variation of  all I feel is you   it solidifies their relationship in a way where wanda benefits from companionship  not dominance like a   would  she s unstable as a secondary response to the trauma  not a primary one where it would relate to her core  wanda is in the fight of her life for erasing conflict and sorrow aka PEACEMAKING,infp
She definitely had an FiSi loop throughout WandaVision until she came back to her senses and realized what she had done was wrong  What remarkable character traits and interesting character development ,infp
WandaVision completely messed with her character    as someone who has always had her under the top three of most relatable characters  she s  w    w  s are known for wanting peace and while yes she definitely does  but they also tend to avoid conflict  stay passive  and stick with a routine to ignore issues  However  we see how Wanda creates conflict  intentional or not   doesn t mind being aggressive when necessary and prefers escapism to a routine when ignoring issues  We see with  w  s have major issues with real world issues and facing the problems at hand  dislike of authority  and major withdrawal issues  I highly advise that anyone considering that she s a  w  take a lot at her behaviour through the films and not just to the TV show as not only her fabricated world of escape  Not to mention  seeing as this is her  perfect  world  her personality may come across as much more fictive in comparison to how she would normally act  Also   w  s have a needed sense of both logic and emotion  needing logical answer but the more emotional reaction at times and this easily sums up Wanda s way of handling things  and due to past trauma  her emotional responses can come off as explosive which isn t exactly something a  w  would do as they tend to avoid conflict at all costs    Some  w  s also use escapism  the difference being is that  w  do it to keep the general overall peace while  w  s do it for themselves to keep them from breaking completely  it s not that Wanda doesn t care about others as she does  but keeping the peace with others wasn t exactly the reason for her creating a completely fictitious world and instead as a way to get away from her severe trauma that was seemingly only growing worse in the outside world  As we see in every other piece of media  Wanda definitely falls under  w  and WandaVision is the first place where we see her move away from   a little bit more but that doesn t necessarily need to override her entire character  Keep in mind the first place we see her character in the MCU is in age of Ultron where she is    and throughout the MCU all we see her character undergoing is traumatic experiences  which is why I think people are feeling prone to put her down as  w  as we see more of the actual traumatic moment and less of her coping afterwards  Do your research on her character and conclude with how Wanda Vision doesn t really show her real character up until the end  the rest of the time it s nothing more than an ideal persona she s put on display ,infp
I dont think that she is an INFP   I thought She s ENFP   The becuase She was so Social   Specially in Wand Vision  ,infp
Her and Shinji Ikari are both type   INFPs with the same hands on head pose in their pfps and that means Wanda kins Shinji because she wants to escape from reality and both have INFJ alien boyfriends and INTJs that opressed them ,infp
 While all of the types employ ego boundaries  the Eight  Nine  and One do so for a particular reason they are attempting to use their will to affect the world without being affected by it  They try to influence their environment  to remake it  control it  hold it back  without having their sense of self influenced by it  To put this differently  all three of these types resist being influenced by reality in different ways  They try to create a sense of wholeness and autonomy by building a  wall  between what they consider self and not self  although where these walls are varies from type to type and from person to person  ,infp
I love how there s a  INFPVillains in her description  Because I agree and I would argue this makes her a very interesting character  One of my favorites in the MCU   If the writers didn t want to shoehorn Agatha into the story so that they can have a big CGI battle at the end we could ve had a far better show where we get to really see how she s the villain of the story but oh well ,infp
oh god  INFP stereotypes are the worst i want to run into a brick wall,infp
I completely disagree  INFP s aren t actually INFP s ,infp
Voting for a friend  the most un INFP INFP that ive ever seen,infp
someone shy  sad  or depressed person  exist   Typology community   I diagnose you with INFP,infp
Hahahaha you guys are crybabies    ,infp
Type   is NOT body focused    At least not all    Why is type   belonging to the  body triad  Type   belong to the  body triad   because it s is related to anger  When they express their anger  they do it through their actions  their body   Type   wants to have a sense of control on their life like   and    But unlike   and    type   maintains control through the numbness of desires  will  emotions  etc Passivity is a form of control  Some  s control their life through routines  other  s control their life  avoiding possibile conflicts and living in their head  and still others control their life by forgetting themselves     Type   isn t focused on preservation of body  So  please  stop to say that INFJ and INFP can t be    I hope I make it clear ,infp
I voted for my husband ,infp
idk kinda seem like a Te dom to me,infp
someone could fix this description pls  most of the other Mbti are described with functions  and this one description is just generic ,infp
I think this makes sense    ,infp
Why are there so many weirdos in the comments talking about how he was a Pisces and his birth chart  Imagine liking Astrology,infp
While I agree kurt was definitely primarily melancholic  in interviews of him he is never afraid to crack a few jokes  and when around people like krist or dave is prone to goofing around  Not to mention close family and friends also mention he was typically a very funny and happy person in settings with his friends family ,infp
The author of the Attitudinal Psyche website typed him as FLEV in a celebrity list and among this was also Lana Del Rey  just thought that was interesting,infp
I ve run a formal assessement on Kurt Cobain  His jungian type was alpha TiFeSi  w  sp sx      Kurt was an ultra emotional INTP in reverse development  not an INFP as many people mistype him to  His reversion was likely triggered by several factors including trauma  depression and drug abuse  Full analysis here  https   youtu be  It p UzFGI,infp
I don t see where the INFP votes are coming from tbh  This man was such an INFJ  through and through  One key example of this his Se Inferior  which comes out in his performances   I m gonna mess this up  shortly before one of the best covers of all time   The Man Who Sold The World  and other examples  Another person I ve seen overwhelming INFP votes for an INFJ is Melanie Martinez  but my argument remains the same  A type   INFJ  both of them  may appear more as an INFP externally because of that Enneagram type s Fi related features  Also Courtney Love was definitely an ENFP  so it makes sense as a golden pair why they had a child together  Also Si Demon with his stomach problem that ended up adding the unique Kurt Cobain  in pain sounding rasp to his voice  This one may be a bit of a stretch  but still   the INFJ stare    He had a kind of silent intensity to his presence that only specifically Ni Doms could have ,infp
I see     in your triad  The   is suitable for type   s intensifying shame  and the    at the end  represents your apathy   His aggressive side suits more to   s violent self preservation when he s emotionally invaded hurt  Their confrontation stemmed from a painful reaction      is the essence of melancholy ,infp
I personally think he s the perfect and clearest representation of an INFP  or at least of an unhealthy one  and god  I ve never resonated with a person so much in my life  Montage of Heck really captivates his thoughts and personality  even how I imagined his mind to be if that makes sense at all  But yeah definitely the greatest and most INFP person to ever exist in my opinion,infp
What a really respect about his songwriting process is that he rarely had super duper thought out  intricate lyrics that portrayed some huge overarching message per se  but would often sort of come up with the music first and then fling on some pretty random lyrics that fit just enough  This is vastly over generalizing his work  but we know that he did that at least on Teen Spirit  My point is that  being a musician myself  I find the task of songwriting to be sort of intimidating as so many artists  work is commonly VERY intentional with its writing  but Kurt was the master of using randomness to his advantage  I just find his usage of pure Fi Ne in his writing super respectable ,infp
why are  almost  all of my favourite celebrities dead,infp
           He is such a loser           ,infp
I m still not sure if I m a     or a    ,infp
i think this is right rn but in a week i can guarantee im gonna be like  wait but what if im actually an         ,infp
I m actually beginning to think im an ISFJ but i don t want to admit it so im pretending im an INFP  ,infp
So many fellows   ,infp
ok i hope this      is right now because it can t take it anymore ,infp
Just end me already lol,infp
Hello other ENTPS,infp
a lot of RLUEIs  so everyone s fuckwd in the head ,infp
Any type twins or cousins on here  I feel lonely    ,infp
this is funny  i am not ,infp
tests really are terrible LOLLL,infp
i went ISTP a INTP INFJ ISTP INTP   ,infp
aHAHAHA yeah ,infp
YIKES,infp
I typed by letters from an MBTI book many years ago  ISTP  When I read the description for ISTP  I knew it wasn t true  and then went to INTP  Thought I was an INTP for a few years  Thought I was a  w  for an embarrassing amount of years until I noticed something was up with my obsessive research into compiling the perfect bug out bag and PEAK OIL          real hot         I went ISTP    INTP    INFP    ENFP    INFP  I think if anyone spoke to me IRL they d type me as an ENFP but I m not  ,infp
Mistyped as INFJ bc how  m not stereotypical INTJ,infp
Like i said in other post  i wish i went to be an ISTP  they are cool  relaxed and women love them  especially with eneagram  w   ISTPs with eneagram   are not much different from INTPs,infp
When I took the MBTI test for the first time on sakinorva  I got ENTP as my top result with ISTJ being my absolute least likely    That proves how terrible tests are  like if they mentioned that Si traits are being practical  down to earth  and focused on realistic objectives and problems and Ne traits are the rejection of practicality  it would ve been so much easier  but they made it seem like Ne was just having ideas and being creative  which EVERYONE does    My Si impressions of the world guide me through life  as I am careful  precise  always relating things to things that feel familiar  and in the real world ,infp
Just mistyped myself as this before i looked deeper to myself and realized what my real type is  Hold up i think this is another mistype  Fi major Ne major Si major Ni major Ti minor Fe minor  Te minor Se minor,infp
I always got INFP on the sakinorva test but in all the others i got ISTP or ISFP  Im actually an ISTP tho,infp
Bisexual guy here  Not the biggest fan of this collective     ,infp

Just a question for members  Why are there so many different sexualities  Can t almost everyone be put into hetero  homo  ace  auto  and bi pan  I mean I get the people that can only be attracted to certain kinds of people under certain conditions but the sheer amount of terms really hurt my brain ,infp
Hi anybody ace here ,infp
I m a lesbian,infp
Hi  closeted or not  I accept you all  it really sucks to live in a homophobic country  don t forget to stay sexy and hydrated and sit still to have a good pisture   ,infp
can we like   talk about the obvious transphobia homophobia surrounding the personality database community at this point  like whenever i go to some kind of polls  especially political ofc  jk rowling s profile etc etc i see so many transphobic comments get upvoted and encouraged  someone called me sexually disabled for not being straight    i had to delete my comment for my mental health s sake  idk im kinda disappointed no one says a thing about this  or maybe im the one who sees them the most sadly but yeah this site is becoming more toxic everyday  edit  i realized weeks later i accidentally said bpd community instead of personality database       anyways how are my borderlines doing,infp
Lesbians are hot,infp
Hahahaha yeah so cool,infp
hate being part of this generation,infp
      i m glad i was born a gen z   ,infp
What a time to be alive  I m so proud of every gen z who finds the time to be productive and work towards fufillement  It takes a lot to stay positive after being born into such a fake  disastrous economy  whose consumerism compulses drug like dependence and misinformation  We ll be the first to catch up to the speed of our technological advancements  and I can t wait ,infp
I refuse to believe that kids born from           are Gen Z  I don t relate with most people born after      at all  There should be in between generations ,infp
gen z n o seria de    at  o in cio de      ,infp
The world is old af and you have an opportunity to live in the same time as me    You are lucky af,infp
 i was born in the wrong generation  is such a genz line  if ur a genz and says this i ve got some news for u,infp
Born in      stop trying to be so different  I wish I wasn t born in this generation  deal with it or off yourself those are your only two options y all think your so different with your very obvious individuality complex grow the he ll up,infp
I m not embarrassed or ashamed of being in this generation  I just wish I was born earlier so I didn t have to be a kid and teen at this time,infp
I can see certain   traits in Shinji  but the overarching emotional patterns in his character story are much more befitting of   rather than      A  s core motivations can be described as seeking inner peace and harmony with others  but consequently neglecting development of themselves as an individual    A  s core motivations can be described as seeking security and the support of others  but act in seemingly contradictory ways as a means of testing their innate anxiety    These cursory descriptions can both be applied to Shinji on first glance  but it is the importance of  neglecting development of themselves as an individual  that truly defines Shinji as a      I    I can t  I m no good  I can t pilot Eva if all I do is hurt and kill people  I thought I had no choice but to pilot Eva  but I was just lying to myself  I m not worthy of piloting an Eva because I don t understand anything  I m incapable of doing anything good for anybody else    This quote summarises a core trait of Shinji s character  his self doubt and inability to assert himself  If a   is defined by distrust of others  a   is defined by distrust of themselves  It is important to understand that Shinji s speech is not implicitly vetting Misato s ability to provide security as a core   might  but is an expression of his genuine view of himself as a burden that causes more harm than good  reflecting on the  s desire for harmony with others through the elimination of anxiety  Not once in the series does Shinji truly blame others for his problems outside of acute contexts in which his inner peace has been accosted  which is much more typical of disintegration to   rather than core   behaviour     s are more naturally comfortable with conflict  Shinji evades it constantly as depicted in his fight with Asuka   Shinji   Asuka  help me  Please  Asuka  you re the only person that can help me   Asuka   Liar   Shinji   Asuka   Asuka   Anyone will do  You don t care who it is  You re afraid of Misato  and the First Child   you re afraid of your mother and father  too  So now you come running to me   Shinji   No  I need you to help me   Asuka    because that s the easiest way to keep from getting hurt  You never even loved yourself  You re all you have and you never even learned to like yourself  How pathetic   Shinji   Help me  Somebody  please  help me  Help me  Help me  somebody  please help me  Somebody  help me  Don t leave me alone  Don t abandon me  Please don t kill me   Asuka   No    This interaction is yet another example of Shinji s repression of individuality in the name of harmony seeking  Riso   Hudson s book  Personality Types  Using The Enneagram For Self Discovery  describe the deteriorated   in a way that perfectly reflects Shinji s behaviour in this scene    At Level    when unhealthy dissociated Nines go to Six  anxiety finally and completely breaks through their massive repression  All the feelings and realizations they have been warding off come crashing down upon them  The person who was once so easygoing becomes an overreacting hysteric  anxiety ridden  fearful  agitated  apprehensive  tearful  panicked  More then ever  deteriorated Nines need someone else to take care of them and to save them from whatever threatening situation they have gotten into  To elicit help from others  they may become abjectly self abasing   morbidly dependent  in Homey s phrase  and masochistically self destructive so that others will have to care for them  ,infp
there are plenty of good   arguments on this page  but another thing i want to mention is that shinji isn t nearly as passive and conflict avoidant as people seem to think he is  And it s not even slight expressions of anger through subtle passive aggressiveness  nor is it an explosion of anger as a result of repressing it  Like he argues and criticizes people semi regularly  and the person he is the most compliant towards is his powerful abusive father  Shinji gets in light hearted arguments with misato and asuka in the earlier episodes of the series and in more serious ones later on  In addition he s pretty willing to stand up for what he thinks is right even though literally everyone was telling him not to when toji s eva was corrupted by an angel  When you compare him to an obvious E  like Rei he s more comfortable expressing his opinion and fighting others ,infp
Shinji is a  w   Although he is a people pleaser and tries to avoid conflict that doesn t make him a   because sp  s also do that  The ego ideal of   is literally to always be reliable and never difficult  which makes sense for shinji   s fixation is cowardice and the fear of worse case scenarios and that they won t be able to rise to the challenge  which once again makes sense for shinji  If you still don t beleive that he is a   then look more deeply into the definition of a sp  s  They try to gain trust to people and show that they are harmless to feel protected  they often use humor  often self deprecating  to try to get closer to people  They stay loyal and part of the reason is for security  Overall i think sp   just matches shinji a lot better,infp
who is shinji    he looks like a squirrel,infp
 i think i finally understand the good part about being praised by someone when i heard my father s words today  and i also realized that the reason i pilot my eva is to hear those words from him   this quote really solidifies Shinji s   disintegration  his self consciousness and pessimism drives him to seek validation through praise and proving his capability to others   and as for the  w  votes  Shinji is more reclusive than compliant  he s very obviously motivated by an underlying fear of being hurt  and while he does act passive around others at times  that can pretty much be attributed to him being an sp   and his   fix ,infp
 Fi is inclined to experience every interpersonal phenomenon as an interaction between two unique subjects  You have your values  and I have mine  But you are not me  We each experience our highest values through our personal  subjective psyche and frames of mind  I cannot adjust my innermost  truest ideas to fit yours  and nor can you adjust yours to fit with mine  We are not to place demands upon each other  but to tolerate each other the way we are  so that we are both free to go our own way  We understand our deepest thoughts and feelings through the purity of our personal subject  which is strictly our own  A great gulf separates your truest  innermost nature from mine  this gulf may be material in nature  or it may not  All I know is that it is there     function axes in jungian typology,infp

 sixes search for meaning  certainty and trust and avoid negative scenarios from occurring   enneagraminbusiness   one of the main fears of a   is losing guidance and stability  which shinji shows throughout the series  for example  in episode    when the character motivations were being explored  shinji says he pilots the eva essentially because it allows him to gain security from others   everybody praises me when i do  everybody takes care of me    to which asuka replies  thats just dependancy  a symbiotic relationship  youre just hoping you ll be needed by others   naranjo describes sp   s as forming connections that will allow them to feel safe and gain a sense of protection  which is what asuka is trying to highlight  another quote of his is  to become secure i have to have value  i want to be worth something  i want to be worth enough to attract the attention of others  which seems very     disintegration   i know dis integration is not meant to be used to type characters but my argument is based upon more than that i think   to be honest he could potentially be a    but sp   s and   s are both very similar and hard to distinguish in a mentally ill character  let me know if i ve made any mistakes or invalid points    also more quotes i think seem very     somebody  tell me  please tell me what i should do    dont abandon me ,infp

As an ESFP I ask thousands of questions and try to talk to him as much as possible but he s an ISTP  just so quiet and nonchalant  ,infp

okay i don t even know anymore i m sorry but i m keeping the  w ,infp
I m pretty sure he s an ISTP    I don t crush on him anymore but he s the only person who I crushed on for so long    we hardly understood each other  I guess I just haven t met the right person yet  But then again  it s kinda hard to  meet the right person  if I hardly meet people at all ,infp

Yeah  they re strong willed and that makes them even more worthy of admiration   If a cat trusts you and loves you  you can be sure it s the real thing ,infp
all my ISTP friends are like cats lmfao cold but cute,infp
they re so cute,infp
Cats are muy guapa,infp
In my family  it s kind of a joke that I have what they d call   the kitty wisper   Once my therapist had a cat who is usually scared of everyone and not wanting to meet anyone  But then  when I come  she will just scurry over to me and crave attention  And this happens with so many other cats  I really can t tell what it is about that  lol  But I love cats  they re like my favorite animals ,infp
INFP   Likes to be alone with cats because they are their only friend and also they are sooo cute,infp
Cats are just really lovely  Not the easiest or most naturally domesticated animal  but loveable nonetheless  When I move into my own place  I hope to get a cat ,infp
I saw a lot of people saying that she can t be INFP because she s not that sensitive  which makes literal   sense lmao  it s really stupid to believe that all Fi doms cry      and are emos  I think that her Fi could be showed on her having   eccentric beliefs and qualities   and also because of   she lacked self consciousness and was not afraid to show who she truly was    The last one isn t really an INTP behaviour for what I remember  but it doesn t stop an INTP to have those traits tho  Still  I think that if she was an Ti dom  she would probably care a little about being seemed as   weird   because of it s inferior Fe  which she doesn t    Luna s demeanour and voice were often distant and dreamy  Ne   she would drift away from a conversation she did not find interesting     this last part sounded very Fi imo  it could still be Ti  but I think it s more a Fi thing rather than Ti      Luna s very logical on her own way  which may be seemed as Ti  but her process of information doesn t sound a lot like it  like believing in the nargles just because her father told her so instead of   checking to see if it they actually exist    not what I actually wanted to say here but I don t know any other way on how to actually explain it lmao     here s some quotes from a fandom website    She seemed to believe everything she read in The Quibbler  mainly because her father wrote it     Fi    Luna also believed in things that were proven true  inferior Te    Harry s story about Voldemort s return  the voices beyond the veil and the belief that there were people behind it  and that Hufflepuff Chaser Zacharias Smith was suffering from Loser s Lurgy  Loser s Lurgy is not proven to exist  but it was true that when Smith lost in Quidditch he thus acted accordingly      She was a complete nonconformist    her lack of Fe  probably    anyways  that s just my opinion about what I think her type is  b,infp
ILI     What the hell       characters,infp
why not  w   w    w s typically try to fit in rather than stand out  also for the  w  voters being different or quirky doesn t make you a    she doesn t fit the trait structure for    but i do think it s in her tritype since she doesn t try to hide her individuality ,infp
When Luna is logical and doesn t care about other people     must be INTP When Luna shows altruistic and caring traits     must be INTP because of Fe What     Literally someone said  She appears to have the rare quality of caring little about what others think of her  although she sometimes gets incensed when her beliefs are challenged  is an indicator of Ti Fe  when that is clearly Fi Te behavior   Luna is an INFP  a very logical one  but she is still an INFP because she uses Te  She believes in nargles because of her father  not because she personally tested and cross checked on whether it made sense  She trusts in others for sources of info  which is baby Te  She is also the kind of person who would believe in    impossible things before breakfast  Not ascertain    possibilities  but BELIEVE in    impossible things  Yes  a Ti user would form their own personal logic on things  which others may find whimsical  but the process of forming the logic still involves intricate problem solving and deduction  It s not like an INTP would pull sth out of their butts and claim it is true  Whereas Luna would actually do that  She would believe in something without any sort of basis  and even if there was a basis  it would be because someone credible enough said it  That s how baby Te deals with things   Why Luna is typed as INTP instead of INFP  Because many INFP traits on PDB are overlooked  including the possibility of aloofness  detachment  and logic use in INFPs  Heck  even altruism is somehow attributed to INTPs now  It s like people are so keen on typing her INTP  that they re starting to attribute opposite descriptions to the same type  She s cold  INTP  She s altruistic  That s INTP too  Apparently  INFPs can t be cold OR altruistic  because they can t be anything except for stereotypical crybabies who have strong feelings  no logic  and selfish at the same time ,infp
IEI   ILI Luna agenda   Her and Hermione are textbook conflictor relationship bruh  Te ego and Te valuing Luna   Luna who believes in stuff like nargles on faith alone without any need for a factual basis    Luna who gets extremely defensive whenever Hermione  Te base  tries to disprove her beliefs based on concrete facts and practicality     She s intelligent but she s not as logical as y all are making her out to be   And just because she s not making edgy jokes      doesn t mean she s not beta NF lol  Some of yall agree her Fi is good and wouldn t it be suspicious for an ILI to have good use of Fi like that  She s pretty good at emotionally consoling and affecting others  especially Harry  multiple times  She also seems to dislike and dismiss Te information a lot of times  ex  literally every interaction with Hermione  ,infp
I agree with   DaffodilDimension   Luna seems detached from physical reality but also just as much detached from accumulation of subjective emotional impressions   the nodes at which her inner world clashes with the outer world  where her personal values clash with collective values  as would be the case with Fi   we do not observe such instances at all  let alone primarily  to type her as an Fi dominant  At the same time  such occurrences are quite evident with Harry  Trelawney  and Snape    She is called crazy not for living in her own world  but for her unusual comments that she makes about the actual world  i e  for the framework of understanding that she proposes   yet her framework is quite innerly consistent and hardly self contradictory from the logical perspective  A lot of the things that she mentions were proven to actually exist and therefore were not invented by her   in turn  she herself is always eager to explain and define for others what exactly she means    In addition  Luna shows a preference for using precise terms to convey something  which I believe would be more in line with Ti Si than with Fi Si that would be more contextual and flow welcoming than static in its self expression   Whenever she talks to someone  she hardly draws attention to herself and addresses the emotional state of the other person without expressing her own   that indicates a Fe valuing type of personality  as well ,infp
  Ti Hero   Luna tries to make sense of the world around her  She looks into the sky and reads every star completely detached from herself  The lunar eclipse    shoving emotions into the dark for reason to shine  Things happen  rather than happenings letting sentiments evoke inside of her  When she talks about her Mother  it is like she is trying to touch her heart  but unknowingly grabbing her head  She certainly is able to feel sad and emotional  but Luna describes her inner emotional world detached from herself with a logical explanation for every feeling that could be felt  When Harry talked with her about Voldemort  she stepped into the mind of Voldemort  rather placing herself in his shoes   she took the most cerebral conclusion that came up into her mind  while analysing other people  Continuing  she is mainly interested in things distanced from herself  in aloofness of her identity  even if she is highly individualistic  Luna has yet not shown one personal value or characteristic she holds dearly  She is concerned with her personal universe and understanding things from the bottom to the top  without necessarily putting herself into the subject of fascination     Fe unconscious   Having difficulties to emotionally connect with her environment  It of course is also Se Blindness detachment to a certain degree  yet people are always far away from her  no matter how close  An invisible wall which she breaks through in times of development  but the force not being strong enough to really grasp the heart of others  She ignores the emotional atmosphere  while connecting logical patterns  which she bluntly expresses to others  Not because she is cruel  but her difficulty to empathise with others on a daily basis  because it would fog her vision for unconventional ideas  Intellectual exchanges are fascinating to her if the picture of interest is painted with a paint brush dipped into examination  Luna values group harmony in times of growth and understanding aside her own mind  in times of flowers rising  without picking one to decipher   Luna is an INTP ,infp
She isn t INFP   I gess  She is not really sensitive so an FI dom   I think luna is INTP ,infp
The way she stays on the sidelines of events and doesn t act upon anything   her role as a passionate observer of the magical phenomenons of the world really reflect on her avaricious character    Type    Passion  Avarice  Anonymity and security are important to the Ego Stinge in order that he can safely watch the world from the peephole of his hiding place  Not only is he avid for the means to maintain his corner  he also is greedy for knowledge of what is going on in life  so that he can feel alive       Furthermore  why not   fix  I don t see any envy or melancholy in her character  she s not really internally conflicted about her image ,infp

creo que chifuyu no es FI dominante  ser a m s bien como axuiliar  como ENFP,infp
I think he s a sp so   rather than a so sp    social  s represent duty and find security in preexisting structures  rules  and laws  meanwhile  self pres  s find security in their relationships and bonds  sp  s can resemble  s with their warmth  generosity  and loyalty reliance on others  which is what I see in chifuyu  he seeks security in baji and goes to extreme lengths to save his friend   also  does anyone have a way to explain his behavior before meeting baji  he was basically a different person  as he was arrogant  impulsive  and would fight people and push his weight around in order to prove his strength to others  it seems like a Te grip or   to   disintegration  but im not entirely sure ,infp
   MANGA SPOILERS     yeah after reading chapter     it s very clear he s Fi Ne  for one thing this guy is very much stuck in the past and has gone through so much loss  losing both Draeken and Baji he thinks ahead of what he s gonna do unlike Takemichi who s more in the moment  his obvious Fi dom came out when he says he s gonna beat up Takemichi,infp
He is such an obvious fi dom where do you guys see inf si    And for anyone saying  well he extrovert  we re typing mbti not his instinctual variant  which he is an obvious social   people have better debates for that  and not his big five  Please educate yourself before stating your opinion   ,infp
Every ENFP argument be like  he is an extrovert   If you think in therms of letters you shouldn t even vote,infp
Ok but like why are the ENFP votes rising  To me  I think he s Te inferior rather than Si inferior  During the bloody halloween era when Chifuyu was discussing to Takemichi abt Baji s  plan   Chifuyu pretty much came to the conclusion that Baji wouldn t betray the Manji gang because  he believes Baji wouldn t do such a thing   He barely gave any evidence on why Baji left Manji  inferior Te  but solely because he believes he wouldn t do such a thing  Fi  ,infp
Why so many ENFP votes    This page requires that new thread comments must be at least    characters long ,infp

How is he an SO      can someone explain,infp
I don t think he s an INTJ  he s more of an INTP  it fits his personality and he thinks and acts like an INTP so he s definitely more of an INTP than an INTJ,intj
Honestly I don t see how an INTJ could have OCD  sociophobia  depression  anxiety and a tendency to write emotionally charged songs  but then be Calm as opposed to Limbic  Jay z is also an INTJ      but you can see music is solely a logical intellectual pursuit as opposed to yoongi s having constant elements of emotion   Also  w  also doesn t represent him well enough  Both his first and second mixtape are from a very   standpoint which honestly i wont get deep into them because one who has listened to them would know what I mean  It s clear the main themes are success  goals  metaphorical hunger and personal struggle    wing  ,intj
Yoongi es tan INTJ que asusta  su Ni dominante es tan notoria que me causa conflicto como los fans siguen defendiendo que es INTP solamente porque  l dijo que le sali  en un test  que Yoongi tenga Ti dominante da risa  Peleen todo lo que quieran  pero Yoongi es un INTJ ,intj
I m an INTJ  w  and I relate to Yoongi a lot  The media likes to pose INTJ s as these emotionless robots but personality is completely fluid and Yoongi expresses his emotions often  while still being an INTJ  People s life experiences play a huge role in personality and that s why Yoongi doesn t seem like a typical INTJ  but I think he s still one  nevertheless  Enneagrams also help to decipher who the person is  It s quite uncommon to have a type   as an INTJ but Yoongi and I are way too similar for me not to vote for him as an INTJ  w  ,intj
Can someone explain ILI  He seems too driven like he has the spark from within  ILIs are notoriously known to need a push from outside which is why their dual SEE activates them  Can anyone explain where this dynamic is   Edit  he s not INTJ either  he got INTP and apparently relates to it so I trust him describing his own preferences ,intj
I came across a YT vid justifying that he was INTP because he had no Ni   like really  MINstradamus  without Ni  They also said he was indecisive because he talks slow   but at a young age  he left his family in Daegu  and without parental support pursued his dreams  Isn t this Ni dom  Te and Fi  And then i realized that vid was by a shipper    and really  sky is the limit   for them just because they needed shipping proofs     Disgusting how they could enforce the false narrative that Yoongi is lazy just to prove their ship when in reality during their pre debut Yoongi writes   bars a day  studies college  has a part time job  is an idol trainee and on top manages his shoulder injury  And even nowadays  sleeping only for   hours and does golf  painting  producing music  studying psych  and shoulder rehabs ,intj

ahhh i m not sure i have been debating between INTJ ILI sp w        INTJ LIE sp w         the only thing at the top of my head for an argument for Si PoLR is what he once mentioned about his shoulder injury  he was not able to afford treatment but still bore with that discomfort so he could be able to debut   Suga recently returned after taking time off to recover from shoulder surgery  This surgery treated chronic discomfort he has been experiencing for  over eight years   As a trainee  Suga s budget was so tight that he often had to decide whether to save his money for food or use it for the bus     probably doesn t mean much  but hey  that s what i remembered       honestly  i can also see weak socio Fe   but i don t really see   and ILI as compatible ,intj

Bruh i don t see any Ti or Ne in him I think that INTJs with enneagram  w  usually gives INTP vibe  also he s already have   in his tritype  ppl istg INTJ s can be  lazy  too   I don t understand INTP votes see him as a Ti dom,intj
 Read edit  I don t understand how is he Ni Te instead of Ti Ne  I think he s an INTP just like L  i agree that he has a different enneagram tho  I d love to see actually valid and convincing arguments for him being an INTJ instead of INTP  I don t see much Ni and no Te   w  seems pretty fitting to me tho  so imo he s an INTP  w    edit  found a pretty decent argument for Ni  But now i d like someone to explain his differences with L  which i haven t found any comments about to this moment  I think it could be a way better way to prove he s an INTJ over INTP  since L is a      INTP  ,intj
Cold and clinical  arrogant  harsh  emotionally unreactive  Alpha values make little sense for Near ,intj
https   www youtube com watch v v HSJLDgFgg Ni Moment,intj
I think he s Gamma quadra  with harsh character judgements and vast mental landscapes that somehow let him arrive to conclusions ,intj
Near is the most obvious Introverted Intuitive in the whole fiction  he s the definition about an Introverted Intuitive  he s literally how Jung described this type  His sense of perception of reality  clearly affected by his own intuitive perception  He s probably a Five  I think  if he was a One  he d be more like Batman or he d be an LSI  he d also be more into the physical reality even if he s an INTJ  Ones are instinctive  after all  and they use Se more than Fives  like really more  especially Sx      Although  he s a good character to compare with other INTJ s  Fives  especially  typing ,intj
why near is INTJ  in a basic view  he uses his ni to narrow down his insights and follow a singular path  he doesn t play around with ideas but conciders them to then reject them or accept them  near uses his ni and te paring allowed near to build an efficient plan his te is used to look in the external world and see what is useful and what isnt useful for his plan  for example  seeing the japanese police as useless and used the ISTP detective to do his job evidence of ni and te paring  im not typing near bc hes a planner but bc of the way he plans the one vision  single minded and using the te as efficient and looking on the outside world  I think his ni is obvious and was done on purpose he shows his thinking by looking for a meaning or in a metaphorical way  the way he uses his toys to demonstrate what he think  with the dice falling ect  his thinking compared to L s is looking for a meaning behind something  while L is more possibility focused  his fi was obvious when talking to light  near knows who he is and the morals of his vision  he has a clear understand on good and evil  near sees himself as someone who had to finish Ls job and light as someone with twisted morals  and this makes him fe blind with the te and fi paring  hes always said unlike L he doesnt care about ego  or how someone is feeling he just has to do his duty  unlike L who had an ego battle with light    if you want me to explain more I will,intj
L played with multiple possibilities  Ne   but Near had the singular vision  Ni  to just copy L s homework  This is reflective of INTJ comments here which just say the same thing over and over in an attempt to explain INTJ being his type  Tert Fi can be seen in how he s quirky and weird  It can also be seen in how he views his mission against Light as more of a team effort  We can see Tert Fi in how objective he is compared to Light  ENTJ   Tert Fi is even more detached than Fi inferior obviously  If you watch the show  you may think light loss primarily due to bad luck and his own arrogance  however  if you have brain damage  it is easy that it was really Near s Ni that defeated Light  Wow  INTJs are pretty cool  I hope I can be one someday    Jokes aside  I think INTJ is plausible  but I m skeptical  I haven t even seen a convincing argument for intuitive let alone INTJ  An ISTJ could use L s work to solve the case  It wasn t exactly some Ni insight ,intj
His methods of observation is obviously too different from L s   And That s because he s a Ni Te user while L is a Ti Ne user   L used to consider any logical possibility  Ti Ne   while Near s Ni don t let him to be distracted from his main explanation unless an unusual event happen  ,intj
im all for the INTJ votes but he did not  have a realization  that light was kira  L had left so much information behind and near obviously knew that L had his suspicions on light  near trusted L s judgement pieced the facts together to expose kira     which is why im considering him being a Te dom ,intj
Manga   INTJ  w  Anime   INTJ  w  hard to find his tritype,intj
I can t see the Te or Ni if he was an INTJ  on the other hand  his Fe shows up slowly trought the history and the Ti use is pretty evident during investigating and class trials,intj

I think Shuichi is one of those characters that shows where the rigidity of MBTIs function theory kinda breaks down  He obviously has god tier Ni and Ti but neither INFJ nor ISTP really fit considering his Fe usage is really awkward and his Se usage is virtually nonexistent  I also really don t think he s an INTJ though  he is on the Ti Fe axis  I just can t see him using Ni  Fi  and Te all at once    INTJs have a set of functions that give them a strong sense of vision direction  the ability to efficiently execute their visions  and the ability to be in touch with what they want and what they value  This self contained singularity of focus equips them quite well to exclude other possibilities and values and just get to the heart of what they want to learn or what they want to accomplish  However  these personality traits do not lend themselves well to valuing different perspectives or being in touch with other people s feelings    While I would hardly describe Shuichi as some sort of empath therapist interpersonal relationship god  a big part of his character is that he COMPULSIVELY puts the feelings of others before him  tries to get along  and avoids conflict  He has extremely permeable ego boundaries which come out externally as him constantly second guessing himself  being  too nice   letting others push him around  being likeable in a sort of awkward way  etc  This compulsive and not entirely conscious Fe use suggests Fe is actually somewhere in his stack  a valued function not a shadow function  just in a lower less developed place  Yes  certain Fi users  especially INFPs  can also have these traits but that s because their Ne Si gives many of them them a  softer  edge since they value others  perspectives more explicitly and compulsively  INTJs  ENTJs  and even most ISFPs and ESFPs aren t as people pleaser y since they re more in touch with their own feelings and internally generated Ni perspectives than those of others    I also think that people saying his focus on getting to the truth no matter the cost or how long it takes or how pointless it seems is Te is a mischaracterization of both Te and Ti  Ti being a  personal system of logic  does not mean it s some ultra subjective   truth is relative   Thanos meme  logic can be whatever I want  BS  Not believing in an objective truth honestly just suggests weak thinking function use in general  If anything  Ti is even more      about getting to the complete truth than Te  since Ti users care about accuracy more than efficiency  This is why Ti can come across as overly slow and hair splitting to those who don t favor it  Shuichi repeatedly demonstrates that he s less interested in what s useful than what s true  taking his sweet time to get to the full truth of the matter  much to the annoyance of other characters who don t see the point of his focus on accuracy when they already essentially have all the information that they need  Even if the truth is inconvenient or finding it even hurts Shuichi and the other characters  he has a compulsion to scratch that itch  leave now stone unturned because that s just the way his brain is naturally oriented    As for his enneagram  I think his orientation towards being agreeable and on the same page as other people suggests that he s an attachment type  probably a  w  but possibly a  w    s  especially  w s have a solid sense of self and aren t easily swayed by other people  They don t doubt themselves nearly as much as Shuichi does   especially in the realm of mental logical reasoning  where they tend to be extremely self assured and focused  Shuichi is far too down to earth and agreeable to be a    let alone a   with a   wing  who tend to pride themselves on being edgy  unconventional loners  He also doesn t struggle with  ish issues like over specialization  disconnection from reality  and flaky disengagement regarding interpersonal commitments  His main issues revolve around not trusting himself enough  apologizing too much being kind of a pushover  and being afraid of being without support   w  stuff mostly  though I suppose  w  could also fit ,intj
 socionics post  Idk if Fi activating feels right for Shuichi  much less creative Te or even suggestive Se  The whole game is about him trying to find the ability to assert himself  get over his fear of hurting others  and develop his Te as well as embrace his ignored Ni  Also POLR Fe definitely isn t right considering the ending of the game where he just went into a pure emotional and genuine monologue,intj
Honestly  this whole argument of INTJ Shuichi vs INFJ Shuichi is the stereotypes   INTJs such as myself always get stereotyped as being cold  calm  and collected  We are apparently emo  emotionless  practical  and we are legally not allowed to show emotions   INFJs however  get love for being the  kind and smart  stereotype  And apparently  if an INFJ is unhealthy  they are an unhealthy ENFJ or an INTJ   Honestly  people are forgetting that INTJs have tertiary Fi  which actually makes us opposite from being unemotional  I actually think we are TOO emotional  since Fi is our tertiary function  and people seem to be more in tune with their tertiary functions than their auxiliary functions   Either way  just because Shuichi is sensitive to other people s emotions  or is  too emotion to be an INTJ   it still isn t enough evidence to eliminate INTJ as one of Shuichi s types    Of course  INFJ is still possible  but if Shuichi had Ti  he would go with outcomes that made sense to him  instead of exploring all possibilities  In some circumstances  even though something made a lot of sense to him  he didn t pulled through with that consensus  since he wanted to explore other possibilities  which actually lead to the correct verdict   However  I am glad we are clear with Ni  His style of detecting is promoting other possibilities  and eliminating each one with evidence  only to provide one obvious clear path  Plus  he does tend to notice the bigger picture than small details  which leans towards Ni   Anyways    I really doubt Shuichi is an INFJ  While basing it off stereotypes  INTJ might not seem plausible  If we took those stereotypes  and defenestrate them    we d see a lot more connections  and it becomes a lot more probable for him to become an INTJ ,intj
This isn t even about typology but can we take a moment to appreciate how Kaito and Shuichi are duals lol ,intj
can someone explain to me how he s an INTJ  i really just don t see him as one ,intj
I literally can t see him as an INTJ    Can someone explain me why you guys think he is an INTJ  I am so confused,intj
why     instead of      it s been a while since i watched the gameplay but i thought E  was more present than E  ,intj
he play chess  INTJ   he is the protagonist of his anime  ENFJ  and he commands people  ENTJ   of course he is a new personality type  A FTJ   I call her JUAN  And these are the funnnctions  Fe Te Ti Fi  He doesn t need intuition because he is intuition itself,intj
Enneagram sexual  s have a passion and anger which fuels them to lead others into being  better   in his views  to achieve the goal or create his ideal society  This enneagram and subtype can be seen in conquerors and group leaders who invade or attack and their reason is  I know what s best for this community so I have a right to do it   Their anger to a personal situation can lead to them trying to  perfect  the society as the way they see it would be perfect    This is the only One subtype that lets their anger take control this much  Their anger may lead them to mental corruption and impulsivity    These Ones are avengers  they are not afraid of confrontations  They may be containing a murderous rage that they cannot see  Their anger can be like a volcano that erupts  They perceive themselves as strong  They have great strength and determination and can be very brave  Because of their rage they are also impulsive and do things quickly   How suprising is that these ones look like enneagram type   because of their assertiveness  braveness and will to dominate  However what makes them different from   is that      they do this to reach their goal of the perfect society     they aren t as chained up as  s on tangible reality,intj
can somebody explain me how he can be E  and has inf se,intj
How could you vote  w  if he chose to die as an all hated icon  I can see his  w  integration  since  w  don t care about being hurt as  w  do  He died knowing that people will know him as the    nonconformist of the world  ,intj
His extreme disposition for ambition out of the necessity for constant flattery shows his histrionic ego   whether he s acting like a smartass who doesn t care about school or the social fighter Zero  notice how the necessity of power is always accompanied by recognition and applause  the necessity to present himself as great  to have devotees and followers      Lelouch is conflicted by presenting himself as great to the father who abandoned him at the same time that has the need to be free from him by destroying everything Britannia represents  just like E  s cognitive issues    Fixation   Flattery  Needs an approving audience  Many entertainers belong to this group  Trap   Freedom  Although dependent upon others for constant approval of himself and his actions  he is fighting that dependency in order to be free from social disapproval and approval        Besides  he fits the SO  subtype greatly  Here is a description by Chestnut that represents well the passion of Lelouch for Ambition   In contrast to the other Two subtypes  the Social Two appears as a powerful or intellectual person  This Two have a passion for power  and their pride is expressed through having influence and advantages and cultivating an image of being an influential person   Doesn t that fit how he acts with Kallen  CC  Zero s followers  and himself in general  The fantastic and theatrical is what he always intended ever since the beginning   Lastly  I want to address the fact that he s not   fixed at all  keep in mind Vengeance is not interpreted in the same way by the passions descriptions  and it s fairly obvious he s too methodical and disciplined to fit the immediate explosive reactions of Eight ,intj
is it just me or is the EIE  ENFJ  in his socionics not necessarily from him as a person  I think the dominant Fe is just his method of using his powers  Like a step in order to use them   but I don t think the buildup to wanting to use the powers is dominant Fe  I think he has a more structured system like a LIE s Te and he decides internally when to use the powers   And another thing    if he s enneagram   and knowing his purpose of life which is the grudge against his father  why is he not against C   He like never questions her intentions  I would imagine an enneagram     would be furious for being under unknown control from C  the geass  I guess this is Lelouch s sp blindspot speaking   i just started watching the show so sorry if this is all wrong ,intj
This is one of the worst profiles on this website  Apart from socionics and temperament  everything is way off the mark  I am tempted to make seperate comments and threads for each category and why they are wrong  Although the most painfully obvious one is the enneagram type  Lelouch is not   core nor is he even   fixed and this could be realized when reading original enneagram sources such as Naranjo or Ichazo rather than bastardized contemporary sources such as the Enneagram Institute or Enneagrammer    In the social dos  the passion of pride manifests itself as a satisfaction in the conquest of the public  It may be that to awaken to a great passion it is not necessary to develop much intelligence  or to show it  but a social two could never be enough to be considered a silly blonde  A social two needs to be someone  and in order to be someone you need to use your mind more  Being a person who wants to be important in order to feed his pride  he must be able to seduce the social environment  becoming a group seducer  a distinguished being and  perhaps  not only someone superior  but with a gift of leadership  Ichazo spoke of ambition  but we could say that it is a passion to be in a certain sense above  and through such being above  having influence and having advantages  This is the type of person who presents himself to the world as great or important  unlike the sexual E   who is primarily interested in being important to his partner  or the conservative type  which  as we will see  is a contra two    Lelouch fits this type like a glove  He also definitely has a   fix and SX  would be my second most likely pick for him  He is also   fixed due to fluctuating feelings of inferiority superiority and his obsessions with planning  He is not   fixed because  he is smart   Types like Social Twos desire power way more than any type of   would and I wish PDB would just realize this already ,intj
Lelouch it s not EIE  The Leader Te is more in charge of collecting data in a more objective and productive way  leaving aside the external emotion of other people  Lelouch is a person who pursues his ambition to take revenge on his Father and reign all  at the moment in the that he suffers from doubts  he begins to consider his morality  his motivation and why everything started was due to his own belief that comes from within and not from some external factor  proclaiming himself as the just and correct  Fi   Now  the geass is somewhat manipulative by definition  not by using the geass the user becomes a Fe leader  he enters more into the Fe role  which is a person whose first impression on new people or also his  mask  is the understanding of the emotions of the people and the consideration of them  not by the geass a person becomes a Faith leader   The ILI is stereotypically the INTJ  however he does not misuse Faith because he knows how to respond to the emotions of others  however his main focus was always ambition and doing all kinds of acts  no matter how immoral  to achieve it  something like  The end justifies the means  ,intj
INTJ with a very well developed Ti,intj
Contradictions are what create character traits  after all  You wouldn t think a Ne dom  who is constantly going off on tangents when bored  would take the time to deeply contemplate matters and rely on subjective reasoning outcomes  Ti  if you were not told that Ne Ti establishes an ENTP s personality profile  which creates the troll stereotype  The same thing happens here   People saying INTJs can t be   cores or EIE have no idea how big the world can be  Forget fictional characters  if you honestly believe people fit in the little boxes we created for them  personality types  perfectly  where no inconsistencies can exist  then you are far from mature enough to even be debated  The world is much bigger than this  and unlike the purely objective fields in science  psychology is highly subjective as it s highly dependant on the sampling method   As for fictional characters  it doesn t matter what personality traits work together  What matters is whether the character exhibits them regularly or not  They are created by people  who themselves carry contradictions  as discussed earlier  There isn t a shred of evidence that an INTJ can t be an  wX or an EIE  In fact   s thrive to attain independence above all else  which is not uncommon for INTJs  so I don t even see your point here  Furthermore  although they have Fe POLR  INTJs are known to be able to twist situations around in their favor  which is an EIE characteristic  If given enough background information  an INTJ can utilize Fi to discern the nature behind the collective feelings of others and use that to their advantage  which allows them to  at times  manipulate the collective emotions as ENFJs do    Throwing all that out of the window  we can easily say that the compatibility of types from different systems of personality analysis wasn t even a factor in creating said systems  Although they may have served as references  I m pretty sure the people behind Socionics didn t look at Enneatypes and changed their system to create a correspondence  What we have are correlations  based on average results from surveys filled out by sampled individuals  which is inherently biased as those people who took them had already  even if superficially  been affected by their personality test results   In conclusion  if your argument is  INTJs can t be         or something along those lines  grow up and say something useful once you ve watched the show ,intj

I don t type someone immediately   But I type someone through cognitive function and enneagram  and how they might change in the future  people do change to their shadow function and stay there or get out from it   I though this one girl is ESTP  after I know her  She is clearly an INFJ with developing Ti   She dislike party  loud noise  shallow connecton  doesn t participate in hook up culture  very creativity  long term planner  faithful   Her cognitive function goes like this  Ti Ni Fe Se   So yes  she is INFJ with very developed Ti  it is even overshadow her Ni until you get to know her   Moreover  I know her potential  She is going to change my country  and I am going to make her vision come true ,intj
Anyone else sees social      Social Twos can also be workaholics  with a tendency toward omnipotence  They may appear enthusiastic  confident or overconfident and even manic at times  They tend to engage in power struggles  wanting to dominate and play the protector  and they may express a sense of territoriality at times  They usually have a highly positive sense of their work and their goals as well they believe that they can accomplish anything  People with this subtype tend to deny vulnerable emotions  such as shame  fear  despair  mistrust  jealousy  and envy  They may sincerely believe they are displaying vulnerability when they aren t  or they may use a show of vulnerability for effect with an audience  The Social Two can resemble a Three or an Eight  ,intj
Bro s a classic INTJ villain   j   STEREOTYPE JOKE  YALL MISS THE  J   The amount of Ni he has is foul    I was thinking about how his crazy ideas of becoming famous  the ones he was sharing on love or host  actually became true  and he didn t stop until he achieved that   in a million opportunity  So stubborn  So much Ni  But I don t really see more Te dom  I d have to see more examples of it  I ll change my vote if I m incorrect ,intj
On second thought  why is he  w   Just because of the mask he keeps talking about   I could think of some arguments for enneagram   dom instead   YouTube just like any other social media presence fundamentally fulfills all the desires of an enneagram    Who s there to stop you from being you online  You literally have      reign over your online presence  Whatever future your online presence leads up to  it s      caused by you and your actions  Past that desire you have freedom to set up your own username  your own online image  and your own management style  In contrast to real life however  where your life isn t so controlled by you  A young creator like Dream has to deal with his parents and schoolwork  for example  The two leading enemies that I also see in my life  So like me with my numerous past online images  I d imagine an enneagram   would be immediately satisfied with having an outlet like the internet where they could simply live their life according to themselves   A kinda weaker observational point I see with enneagram   with similar attitude behavior like dream is how they imitate a   early on in their life  If Dream were a dom    his  stress  would be real life  Once he d come to terms with accepting YouTube as an outlet to live his life  he d start with getting information about it first  I assume Dream s plan for his YouTube channel was incredibly planned and worked perfectly  because of the fast growth   For some reason I can see Dream in other characters like Lelouch from Code Geass  who s INTJ  w   Lelouch s upbringing in his real life as Lelouch Lamperouge could be seen by others as a dom   vs dom    but as soon as he got the code from CC his real purpose of life could begin  and suddenly he s a dom    I guess you could symbolize YouTube as the code  P  I do believe though Dream is SLE in socionics vs LIE  The inferior Ni and depth in explaining himself personally really shows in interviews  idk where to start with examples of this lol   But I don t this this could be mistaken for ENTJ s inferior Fi  Maybe it s because of this reclusiveness of his personal life it s hard to see him as an   rather than a     Of course the internet is a persona and all that    so only Dream himself or like super super close people to him could know his real intentions behind YouTube ,intj
Listen to his music  its pretty typical angsty  w ,intj
the fact that he got INFP the last time he did the    personalities test lmao also some of these comments clearly have only heard about dream through twitter and have never heard him speak  there is no way he s an ENFJ  i can understand ENTJ votes  but the way most of his friends describe him sounds a lot more like a ni dom  and this is off topic but why are most comments hating on him  idc if you hate him but this is a typology page just talk about his enneagram or something its not that hard,intj
obviously an ESFJ        fe   i wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time  he wants to make other people happy so he s obviously an fe dom  si  he s shy ne  he has adhd ti  no one likes him,intj
I m not going to type because I don t know enough about him  but I think the ENTJ votes are coming from a place of limited perspective  We hardly know anything about Dream s personal life  and so the only thing we see is what he posts in response to people s comments about him   Everyone s arguments about him handling controversies and telling his fans to stop their behavior is more of an enneagram   behavior than a Te behavior  Think about it  how would his Ni manifest in his platform if his enneagram   exists  It s pretty dominant  especially since his job is to please and entertain people   That said  we only know approximately    of his life  so we can t make a conclusive assessment of his type ,intj
Can anyone who isn t interested in typing him go back to twitter please  jfc this is the worst pdb page I ve seen on this site   Anyways i think what still keeps me a little hesitant about the ENTJ vote is how unadaptable he is in mcc lol  He seems to put everything on planning practicing and when new changes come his way he gets frustrated and messes up  And then he can t move on from those mistakes and messes up on later games too  Not to mention how easily he gets sensory overload  This could be a tertiary se problem too so I m not sure ,intj
I think his recent tweets really highlight his dominant Te and general EJ temperament  He s very intent on influencing the thinking of his fans and even his haters ,intj
Spoiler alert  Hi  I made a compilation of moments in which it seems to me that Homura uses Ni  in some scenes Homura s Te and Fi can also be seen  I also found examples of Homura using Ni at the beginning of her travels   https   vimeo com manage videos          ,intj
Does anyone think she might ve been a ISFP at the start of the chain and slowly over thousands of years and universes she changed so much for the sake of Madoka she changed into an INTJ  INTJ persona I just kind of like that understanding of it people she did seem to have high fi in the original universe,intj
id rather assume she entered a Te grip after trying so many times    When we look back at her past  there is no reason to think she was a Ni   Te user when healthy  Its very clear she started changing after being in a hard and traumatizing loop   The child position seek others approval and is over expressed in a very unbalanced way  its related to others just as the parent position  the difference is that the parent is used to help others  and its done in a way more balanced way  As it is the parent and its usually very developed  so its less expressed as the user will be able to tell if that moment really demands the use of that function    But homuras Fi is used in a very heroic way for her  its what justifies all of her actions  she doesnt take care for people using her fi on being empathetic or taking care of others sentimentality thro critic Fe  parent position  or by being over expressed in a unbalanced way seeking others approval and wishing to call others attention as a child  Her fi is very stable throughout the series  Her Ne Ni on the other hand is used to help madoka  feeding her with ideas and visions  the parent position has very good access to she shadow  what means to say she has good access to both intuitive functions  what fits perfectly   The expanding tree she created in the end  full of time lines  is a representation of her Ne experimenting new ways always one of these ways failed to achive her vision  As the vision is the critical parent here  she had and experimented several ideas to achive what that  annoying and insistent shadow parent  demanded  thro her aux parent Ne  If it was the opposite  her final vision would get adapted to the demands of the Ne parent  What is to say  Homura probably would keep trying to save Madoka  but adapting her vision to an ending that was actually possible  what means for example that she could probably see how the creation of a lot of time lines would end concentrating power in madoka  or seeing her probable corruption for example    Her child position  Si  can be explained by both her power and wishes  metaphorically speaking  playing around with time and traveling to the past  Concretely speaking  using the same method over and over again  what is to say  to go back in time even when that method had proven useless  we know that it wasn t exactly a timeline that saved madoka and herself  and that s what she had in mind  instead it was the several timelines and their energies forming a single bigger energy centered in Madoka  something that was not in homura s plans ,intj
Focusing on whether Homura interprets reality using Ni or SI  it seems to me that his dialogues are loaded with Ni  symbolisms  patterns  big picture thinking  rather than Si  subjective and detailed sensations   Here are some quotes from Homura that include the episode and minute in case you want to check it out on your own   episode    min         It would not have changed the destiny of Tomoe Mami  but you could change your own destiny   episode    min         Remember  that kindness can bring you even bigger problems   episode    min         With goodness comes naivety  courage turns into foolish actions  and dedication has no reward  those who do not understand that they are not suitable to be magical girls   episode    min          But I will tell you exactly what I am responsible for  at this point  it is a mistake that I will never be able to correct  it is as useless as trying to revive the dead  once someone becomes a magical girl who no longer exists it is a way to save her  the contract requires that they sacrifice everything for a single hope   episode    min        I am an ally of calm and an enemy of those who fight without motives  whose side are you Kyouko Sakura    episode    min        A miracle is still a miracle  she made the impossible come true  even if Sayaka Miki would have dedicated her life to him  he would never have played again  sometimes not even a whole life can buy a miracle  but that is exactly what he is selling    episode    min        She took the weight of the curse that equals that desire  she will live causing suffering as before it helped others  There are more quotes like these  but it seems to me that these examples are enough ,intj
honestly if I found a super good argument for ISTJ then I might vote it but I think that homura is a INTJ and here s why  also spoiler lol    starting with ni  the way that she was repeating the same loop of doing the same thing over and over again was not because it was what she had simply always done  si  it was based off of the things that she observed when she was with madoka about how the magical girl world worked  and she came up with kind of a subconscious plan to save her without considering her outer environment to adapt to anything else  again  this could be interpreted as si ne but I feel like inf se makes more sense  inf ne would have stunned her from seeing any other options from just given her environment and the situation that she was put in  bu homura was stuck in the loop of trying to safe madoka because she literally would not revert from her original plan and gather information from the outside world to change her statagey    this leads me to the ni fi loop which is so painful  her plan to save madoka from her ultimate fate had absolutely no logical thought put into it  this ties in with the crippling se inf  but she never really looked at all the data and the facts that were around her to conclude how things would plan out  her plan was never about figuring out how things really ever worked  or trying different processes like someone with more developed thinking functions would  she looked at her love and emotions for madoka   fi  and then her assumed that everything would play out according to plan and madoka would stay with her forever which is SO NI FI  ti is someone present in her reasoning  but I would say fe ti is impossible because of how little care she put into everyone else just to save madoka  she did not care who she hurt or how she did it  she only had one motive that was stuck in her narrative  and naterually assumed madoka would feel the same way  madoka being a fe user  literally fe ed herself out of the universe and became god for the greater good so others wouldn t suffer    anyways  I think that its really clear that she s on the te fi axis  if anyone has better arguments for si then I would like to hear them  but I think shes a very clear INTJ ,intj
Ok but I kind of think that Homura might be a      I was reading Naranjo s E  description in Character and Neurosis and I was like  well  that kind of sounds like Homura   but I would like to see what you think    More than those of any other character  enneatype IV individuals can be called  love addicted   and their craving for love is in tum supported by a need of the acknowledgment that they are unable to give tthemselves  Dependency  its corollary  can manifest not only as a clinging to relationships that are frustrating  but as an adhesiveness a subtle imposition of contact which seems the outcome of not only a contact need  but an anticipated defense or postponement of separation     The nurturant characteristic of type IV can be dynamically understood as a form of seduction in the service of the intense need of the other and its painful frustration  Caring for others may be masochistically exaggerated to a point of self enslavement  and contributes thus to the self frustration and pain that in turn activates the demanding and litigious aspects of the character  ,intj
Regarding those who doubt that Homura is INTJ because of his backstory  which occurs in episode    of the anime  You can see a weak and insecure Homura  who is depressed on her first day of class and feels useless for not doing things as well as she would like  taking this into account it should be noted that Homura had missed classes for a long time due to a heart disease  which explains why she behaved that way  INTJs are also human  beyond the mastermind stereotype  and they can have fears and insecurities especially Homura who was    years old and was returning to class after spending a long time in bed  So episode    does not contradict what is shown in the entire anime and Rebellion  Even in Rebellion  the insecure Homura returns and proposes to Kyouko to return to her ancient city to check that there was nothing strange because she had a hunch that reality had been changed  which shows a good use of Ni and Te  And for those who say that Homura cannot be INTJ because she did not have a plan to save Madoka  it seems to me that Homura s plan shown in the anime consisted of keeping an eye on Madoka to prevent her from making her wish  in allying with Kyouko to fight in Walpurgis Night and use her experience learned from time travel to become stronger in combat ,intj
I m not really sure how to type her but I m highly sceptical about her being a INTJ    Sure she looks like one for a big part of the anime on the stereotype   but we learn later her back story it s hard to still see her as a INTJ    If we take into account her original self  it s not logical to type her INTJ at all  First we know that she became this way after a deep trauma  in other words she kinda was forced to grew up quickly to accomplish her wish  I see her similarly to Eren from SnK  many people started to type him INTJ after the last season because he became more cold but like Homura he had to mature quickly because of the burden they have   But we KNOW that they weren t this way naturally  And it makes sense because even in their  cold persona  we can see that they re not real Te aux by the way they act  They try to be efficient but they aren t   They both failed  and in Homura s case she didn t even have really a plan to save Madoka except spamming her time travelling power    Not gonna vote yet because I m still not sure about it myself tho ,intj
Hi  I don t think Homura is Fi dom to begin with  throughout the entire series she used a lot of Te and uses it quite well to be an inferior function  in fact she uses it more often than his Fi and fits quite well into the auxiliary position as Homura relies on this function to structure and order the world around her in accordance with the goal of saving her  As for her Fi she fits quite well as a third function  to achieve her goal she is willing to do things that go against her values  such as when she considered killing Sayaka before her gem was corrupted  and the ease with she represses her feelings  Homura was willing to save her because of how much she appreciated her  if she had been someone else  she would not have sacrificed so much  so it does not seem to me that it is a proof of Fi dom Another topic to touch on is her lack of Ne in the anime and Rebellion  not even when she was insecure  I didn t find any example of Ne and if anyone has any we can discuss it  on the other hand she uses Ni and uses it quite well  in her attempts to save her  she was not willing to accept another future  or as in Rebellion  when she begins to doubt reality by a hunch that something was wrong  or when she comes to the conclusion that she had become a witch  or her plan to steal Madoka s powers  Finally  his Se inferior seems easy to notice throughout the anime  it can be seen that Homura tends to stay out of situations watching the magical girls from a distance and only interferes when she considers it necessary  and in Rebellion when she decides to alter reality seems Se inferior ,intj
Why is she under  YandereCharacters  Did we watch the same anime     also her becoming a demon is not a yandere move  she literally just didn t want madoka to be a god anymore  she doesn t kill others for madoka or anything  nothing about her is yandere lol ,intj
while I think he definitely is an INTJ  I m shocked to see the lack of ISTJ voters  as Walt shows a decent bit of Si throughout the story  he places a heavy emphasis on his own past and can recall bits and pieces of it in high detail  down to the minute  from how he describes his failure with selling his Grey Matter stocks to him describing the moment in which he wished he would have died  he is drawn to his own internal sensory perception of how events turned out  even with krazy    walt noticed the missing plate shard due to him detecting slight changes in the physical environment  while this could be attributed to his Ni Se working together  I think it could also be explained by Si  However  I think his Ni takes priority over Si  and his inferior Se develops  albeit unhealthily  throughout the series ,intj
My god  now that I ve realized I have all of Walt s roles ,intj
as his whole scientist thing it makes sense hes  w  but i guess from where i stand his core fear  in the beginning at least  was for his family to be left without security and ample finances  it just seems more   core to me  but i m very open to  w  too ,intj
he seems more of a rloai than rloei imo but if anybody has any arguments for rloei drop em under here,intj
why Melancholic Choleric   Choleric Melancholic fits better imo,intj
Besides the points people have already made about his desire for competence  proving his intelligence etc   I also want to note how he further shows he is   through   s passion of greed  Greed is defined in the case of   as withholding from the world  keeping resources physical and emotional for yourself  This is shown in Walt s case in several ways  He is very secretive with his family  easily lying and distancing himself from them  This shows   s greed in the context of emotional withholding and secretiveness  Note that this isn t just when he has something to hide  his meth cooking  that could get him in trouble  he is similarly secretive about his cancer  He wants to withhold important information from his family no matter what  and is afraid to share anything     He is also greedy and withholding in the context of money  refusing to accept any charity from Elliot and Gretchen  He has a compulsive desire to isolate from the exchange of giving and helping each other that most people participate in so he can trust only his own competence and not rely on anyone else  Walt even refuses treatment entirely at first  because he doesn t want to demand anything from the world and doesn t want the treatment to stop him from being competent and able to take care of himself before he dies  A   would want and accept support from others because they doubt themselves  and would not have this powerful desire to isolate themselves  trust only themselves  and refuse any form of support or even sharing how he feels with his family    Concerning his tritype      makes a lot of sense but I think you could make just as compelling a case for      I get where the   fix comes from  as he always feels he lacks importance  resents that Gray Matter was so successful without him while he was forgotten  and wants to show off his image as Heisenberg all the time  It s also true  however  that a lot of his character and motivations revolve around   s passion of pride  Pride manifests in  s as a belief that they are selfless providers without needs of their own  even as they are in fact desperately searching for the love they feel they earned and are entitled to for how selfless they are  This very well describes Walt s character He is too prideful to accept any help or admit his own needs  and maintains this self deception where he feels he deserves love and praise from his family for all he does for them as their provider  Furthermore despite his claims of not having needs  he is bitter and resentful about not getting the love he feels he deserves  While there s a very real argument for a   fix  I feel like   fix isn t even being considered despite considerable evidence because of the stereotype that   fixes go to fluffy nice characters  ignoring the core of  s being that aforementioned pride  self deception  rejection of needs  and entitlement to love that fits Walt perfectly  I would love to see this discussed a bit more   ,intj
How did the type change from ENTJ  I see this happen a lot  Is there some sort of secret society meeting to just change a character someone s type or something ,intj
Clear INTJ  w  integrating to   throughout the show s run  Keep in mind that   is in the fear head triad and  s deal with fear of the external world is by aquiring knowledge and becoming competent  While he does seem to want to prepare for any danger in the future he does not seem fixated on it and is more prone to take risks due to him believing he is capable of handling it  He does not seem to disintegrate to a   like a   would but instead when he is frazzled and stressed out he starts acting in a unpredictable and sometimes hendoistic fashion like how a unhealthy   would act  Him becoming more daring and aggressive is not due to him being counter phobic but him integrating into an   as well as leaning more onto his   fix  He also never stops being a core   and was always concerned with being competent and knowledgeable ,intj
 I m all for positive but    positivity doesn t change the facts or the need to be prepared    Said like a true INTJ lmao,intj
that one     ENFJ vote  ,intj
I kind of see the reason his an INTJ from being happy as a kid but then maturing after  Spoiler warning below   His father died since its common for INTJ fictional characters to have their dad dead  idk for a reason they are cold  but I see that common pattern when it comes to INTJ fictional characters and Diluc is a good example of how they act as  ,intj
my little meow meow                          ,intj
He has edgeworth s typology  backstory  personality  etc  literally everything also they red   but simon blackquill s hair   the bird  No wonder I love him  His ni use in the dark knight quest   get it ig,intj
INTJ    really    his Fi is literally so high  you are all so blind,intj
If we listen his voice lines i have thoughts that he s Fe user  It occurred to me that he has ni or ti grip Well  maybe fe or se dom because he s really broken ,intj
He s not INTJ at all  Diluc is too concentrated on his duties and responsibilities  He hasn t got any thing  where he will push himself  as typical INTJ  Also  Diluc is too rational for Ni users  Ni is an irrational function  keep this in your mind  He has great Te vibes  while he don t care about his free time and his desires  but doing job well   Sorry my eng is not really good,intj
never wondered but now I m thinking why there s     in his main enneagram  he definitely has the   features  like goal to please him father  make him proud and being loved  and he s definitely fighting for people of mondstadt around a lot  I get why     in his tritype  but what s so   about him that covers his   ,intj
Il y a litt ralement  crit sur le site officiel des    personnalit s qu il est ENTJ,intj
E   Are y all okay      And sp  at that  Y all realize it doesn t even match that well w INTJs anyway  So  is a much better match    Anyways  ENTJ arguments are far more compelling and this man is a clear sp  ,intj
yes he has a very strong   but do not mistype him as ENTJ,intj
The ExTJ voters should read the comments  buried below  arguing INTJ  We re not voting Doctor Strange INTJ  w  just  because he s smart  or  he s strategic and analytical   Iin his first film he has conflicts with his Se  no Fi  and the character is written as Ni  Te  read the comments please  ,intj
I saw more te dom in him but im still a bit confused between ENTJ or INTJ  the one from the recent spiderman movie ,intj
Any one wants to know his type have to watch  Dr Strange   In spiderman he is an ENTJ with well developed Ni  so it s a bit tricky for some ,intj
I watched the spiderman movie no way home  it was my firsy spiderman movie so forgive me if I am wrong  but throughout the movie I found myself constantly noticing ni te in him  in everything he does his INTJ personality sticks out  I noticed he was an IXXJ when he wanted to put things back to normal and disagrees with Peters ne use in the situation ,intj
 Spoilers kinda    idk  he showed a lot of Ni throughout NWH when he was adamant with  they all die fighting Spiderman   it s their fate   but I do get the Te dom angle  You could also interpret his refusal to let them redeem themselves without reward as inferior Fi  but idk ,intj
He definitely seemed like an ILE in NWH  I also liked how the main conflict stemmed from the differences in Stranges and Peters dominant perceiving functions  Strange   They all die fighting the other Spider Man  It s their fate    Ni  Peter   What if it wasn t    Ne ,intj
Kinda kin him  honestly just because of no way home they are giving him te dom vibes  I may be wrong but maybe he can be LSE or LSI cause I saw that more in him  but I m not that educated on socionics so any discourse would be appreciated Great movie guys please watch no way home,intj
Para quem est  dizendo que ele   ISFP  o Sasuke NUNCA teria o Te inferior ,intj
While we can t assign properly a type to this character with Mbti  because he indeed has both characteristics of the types ISFP and INTJ   socionics provides the perfect categorization  ESI   I think MBTI actually has some theory holes and sometimes it is superficial or too generic  also for real life people  and this is why I m starting to use it just to determinate people goals  Ni   living for a dream to come true  Fi   determ one selfs value etc   in combo with a sociotype  process through he tries to accomplish that goals    So  yes  Under these circumstances I would say he is INTJ ESI because he wants to reach a goal  still he lacks the major part of INTJ traits and resemble more an ISFP ,intj
 Sasuke   INTJ  argumentos  ele   inteligente e pensa em derrotar o irm o no futuro  al m de ser estere tipo de emo frio e calculadora KKKKKKK   ISFP tamb m pode ser inteligente  e sobre ter a meta de derrotar o irm o    simplesmente uma META de vida  qualquer pessoa deve ter uma  isso n o diz NADA  Independente dele viver em loop ou n o  a Fi dele t  sempre alta e parece dominante       ele ta sempre emburrado kkk    mant m ele calmo    Ele   claramente  w   estere tipo de personagens que tem uma ambi  o enorme e faz de tudo pra conseguir atingir os seus objetivos  ainda mais sem ser saud vel como sasuke ,intj
Does anybody know what the hell Sasuke s sociotype is  He definitely isn t an ESI  he seems like a beta ST but neither LSI nor SLE really fit him too well   ,intj
Why are there so many ISFP votes ,intj
Come on my friends let s decrease these horrible votes  w   I ll explain even better why Sasuke is NOT  sx An explanation of  sx    This charismatic and enthusiastic Three focuses their competitiveness on supporting others  seeing success in relational terms  They tend to believe  if those around me achieve success  then I am successful  which may lead them to mistype as a Two  They tend to compete for the attention and affection of those closest to them  and may suppress their own feelings to make themselves more attractive to others    Three focuses their competitiveness on supporting others  Sasuke never worried about success  let alone supporting others  and yes he was focused on killing his brother  not even thinking about success and supporting others  Sasuke is definitely not that kind of person and any donkey finds it easy  it s not just because you re competitive that automatically you re a type      They tend to compete for the attention and affecion of those closest to them  Hmmmm  if I m wrong  please correct me  it s been a long time since I watched naruto and I don t remember very well  but I think Sasuke always wanted attention and affection from his brother  so because of that i can easily be refuted  but that doesn t mean it s totally  sx   And may suppress their own fellings to make themselves more attractive to others  No  no  no  Where does Sasuke want to be attractive to others  It s not possible that  definitely not  This is my explanation  about its type could be sp  or sx   and its wing  sp  that is  it could be  w    So please    Decrease those votes  w     ,intj
He acts in strategically ways when fighting  like that time with Deidara  Te   And he s always thinking about the future  Ni  like  I ll become stronger and defeat itachi   And he s not focusing on his appearance as   types  his focus is in revenge   My explanation it s not that deep  but if you want to know more just comment below ,intj
wait his type changed  xd,intj
Hi  I came here to fix this sasuke  w  typo   For the love of GOD  Fix this  w  typo  really pdb users are so DUMB they don t even know how to type a character correctly  in all honesty    This charismatic and enthusiastic Three focuses their competitiveness on supporting others  seeing success in relational terms  They tend to believe  if those around me achieve success  then I am successful  which may lead them to mistype as a Two  They tend to compete for the attention and affection of those closest to them  and may suppress their own feelings to make themselves more attractive to others   WHY WOULD SASUKE BE  SX  Show me arguments that PLEASE let him be that  there s no way  Sasuke is NOT  sx and they still haven t fixed this error  type   is still the most voted  congratulations       The sasuke looks more like Sp   the wing I have no idea  but I won t discuss it   The SP Eight is strong  direct and productive and appears powerful and effective  Confident in even the most challenging situations  they are survivors and are pillars of strength for many as they take the role of guardian  father or mother figure  When their needs are not satisfied  they become frustrated and intolerant  and tend to take a direct  no nonsense approach to get what they want  without guilt or apology   Tell me if this doesn t look like sasuke  he s totally sp   sp sx  that s even a little obvious  so why the hell  w     For God s sake let s decrease the  w  votes    I m using google translator ,intj
Guys  where did you even get  w  from  what     This dude is so angry  his earlier life is literally driven by anger and vengeance  He is not focused on his image or want to be successful in a socially standard  he just wants to kill the man who killed his clan and that itself should prove that he s a literal    Who are these tards voting for     Anyways  I have a question for ISFP voters  Where do you see inferior Te  If he s so strategic  methodical  preferring to plan out his next attacks rather than going straight at it  then what makes his Te low    While with Orichimaru  Sasuke made plans for the future  forming a future squad to assist him in achieving his aims with Itachi  With his Ni  Sasuke is focused on the future  whereas his Te is concerned with efficiency  task orientation  and achieving goals  He frequently loses patience with Suigetsu  telling him that his Te aux is wasting his time  and that he wants to keep going forward with his rational Te aux and Ni dom focus on the future   In a rational bossy Te style  Sasuke is frequently bossy with his Te  He directs  girl with the glasses   about and instructs her to take them to a room  then says   I ll ask you to join me again Karen with his Te   He urges Suigetsu to release all the detainees immediately now  and Suigetsu responds   You and your demanding tone again     Suigetsu remarking on Sasuke Te aux s INTJ personality ,intj
Stop typing him as an INTJ just because he is inventive and good at spells and potions   Dominant Si  Cares about every little detail and enjoys routine  Is strongly attached to the past as proven by his love to Lily many years after her marriage to his school rival and death  Is prejudiced towards Harry just because his father bullied him  He also despises Sirius  Lupin  and Wormtail as his former bullies  and in the last case also a traitor partially responsible for his love interest s death    Auxiliary Te  Snape is a practical thinker  Expresses what he thinks in a precise  painfully straight to the point manner    Tertiary Fi  Snape doesn t discuss his feelings with anyone unless directly asked  Acts according to his moral code and doesn t take other people s emotions into consideration    Inferior Ne  His humor is often using unfunny puns and double meaning jokes   Lupin  Out for a little walk    in the moonlight are we are     Snape usually doesn t trust other people  especially with opposing views  although he is able to work with and for them to achieve his goals  He is creative in problem solving as proven by the sixth book and movie when we find out he altered many potions and created his own spells as a teenager   As I said above  being good at potions is not enough to type him as a Ni dom  Although Snape is able to plan  he is not a grand strategist such as Dumbledore  INFJ  or even Voldemort  ENTJ   He mostly simply does what he is told to do and finds the most efficient way to do so  hence ISTJs are often refered to as the  logicians   Snape also lacks more developed views we would expect from a Ni dom  as his motivations seem to be primarly personally rather than ideologically based  He followed Voldemort  probably  because of his hatred towards muggles and the Marauders who were order members  Then he switched his loyalties out of love for Lily    Unfortunetaly  there are no INTJs in Harry Potter series  Probably because the author would not be even able to understand this type ,intj
how is he an LSI   srsly  How is he a strong se valuer  I see him as an ILI clearly   Yes  i see socio se valuing  but its weak to me  Also  His socio Ni is wayyyyy too good to even be  d  His  d Ni is so damn obvious  Also  Fe polr Ne polr  I dont really see his main struggle with socio ne  Also  tbh his socio fi fits H A better than role to me  he does seem to value socio fe like at all    ni base  As a base function  Ni generally manifests itself through a lack of direct attention to the world around oneself  and a sense of detachment or freedom from worldly affairs  The individual gets his or her primary information about the world through imagination  a person with base Ni may be able to thrive in situations where data are scarce  or where he or she lacks the usual prerequisite experience    fe polr  The individual tries hard to never let himself  come apart at the seams  emotionally or even let out strong feelings publicly  The individual deeply dislikes attempts by others to get him to  cheer up  or  join the fun   especially in the context of group activities with loud emotional expression   this really fits Snape imo   Yes  I do see his Ti very strong  but as a demonstrative function instead  And  demonstrative Si makes zero sense to me    Ti demonstrative  The individual often criticizes others  views from a logical standpoint  picking apart statements and postulates and showing that they are logically flawed  However  he does not choose to do this excessively and does not expect that reality can be accurately expressed in a neat logical systematic anyway   Also  for enneagram  how is he an sp sx    sp   s are the warmest and friendliest ones out of all   s  Social   s are very Prussian  cold  formal  black and white thinking  caring about duty and ambiguity at the most  and he is such a stereotypical one lmfao  Also i do see a lot of cp  traits  but so   sx   imo  Social   doesnt mean being social  group oriented and stuff   btw i can see sp   for him  but i think soc   fits him better ,intj
People saying it s about move character are annoying  For example Hermione is typed same in book and film section  Let s be honest he is I TJ and we can t decide ,intj
Not sure when it comes to his mbti   but deep inside ik he s pretty lonely and it makes me sad  ,intj
The Itachi of the Harry Potter verse   Now I m gonna list some quick thoughts on his typology so I don t forget  Enneagram  Obvious   although I don t think he s phobic  Most likely sx   Socionics  Why LSI  I would ve guessed ILI  AP  It should be obvious that he s insecure emotion lol  Either LVEF or VLEF imo   EDIT  Actually I can see ESI now for a possible sociotype contender  Snape demonstrates good Fi in how he treats harry because of his father  why he favors slytherin students  etc ,intj
i love him and i could fix him i know it,intj
After reading some arguments  I ve been quite convinced of INTJ  So i m going to retract the points I ve made for ISTJ   That being said  does anyone have any decent arguments for   ,intj
Shiit i am an INTJ with  w  but i hate snape actually i hate my self too,intj
He talks about Potions and DADA in a very abstract  mystical way  Also  from the HBP textbook  we can see that he prefers to innovate and expand on ideas rather than adhere to traditional  conventional practices  which suggests Ni over Si,intj
He isn t an ISTJ  Half Blood Prince just proves his Ni  Read again ,intj
She s An INTJ  She manipulates Denji using her Te  not Fe  Although off topic but I think she has WAY too many simps ,intj
SPOILER ALERT   Hay muchas razones por las que considero a Makima una INTJ en lugar de ENTJ  Es complicado de explicar pero ah  van dos      Se inferior  el desenlace de Makima puede explicarlo bastante bien  Su error fue algo bastante tangible y obvio  Como INTJ entiendo ese tipo de errores  Hacer todo lo complicado seg n el plan para  solucionar     El problema es cuando no contemplas cosas tangibles obvias en ese plan  Makima literalmente no consider  a Denji humano una amenaza  en lugar de eso empez  a sumergirse en su burbuja en cuanto tuvo a Pochita    En cuanto llev  a cabo su plan      Fi terciario  Makima tiene motivaciones bastante emocionales con respecto a su plan  No es solo su manera de ver el mundo  tambi n es sobre c mo se siente  La escena de Makima en el cine nos da ese mensaje de  entiendo estos sentimientos  los eval o y soy conciente de ellos   Makima no trata de esconderse a s  misma de sus emociones  ella usa sus emociones  ella construy  un ideal debido a la profunda reflexi n de sus propias emociones ,intj
In the wiki it says this   Makima s true goal  however  was to be together forever with Pochita and lead a happy life with him  She always yearned for something like a family  being incapable of forming equal and meaningful relationships as the control devil   I feel she truly just wants happiness overall I would like some people to kinda talk about this a little more   She wanted a ideal world without fear  death  and  bad  movies  However  failure is also acceptable  as it would mean being eaten an honor according to her  BUT had no way to know she could even get it done It s very idealistic and I haven t seen any INTJ s being that way from all the media I ve seen   ALSO if you want to talk about her mbti  feel free to comment        ,intj
Idk fam she doesn t look like a Pi dom to me  Too expansive and conquering  One thing I learned from Socionics is that you can have internal convictions and be extroverted at the same time  Nor is she Fe leading imo  Fe is role instead  she blends in just fine in parties but pays no real attention to it whatsoever  Also her idea of the  greater good  does not come from any ethical consensus but an overtly utilitarian way of calculating well being  Pretty Te imo ,intj
Manga spoilers   I find it hard to type her by human standard  considering that she isn t one  Sure  by human standard she has so much Ni Te  but Te is subjective to humans and our viewpoint   I mean  by devil standard  she might have a lot of Fe  It s nothing like N S functions  that are about how you view and collect information   it s about making decisions   So I m voting with a little bit reservation  just  cause who knows   ,intj
some of the debate between makima being an ENTJ or an INTJ comes from whether she uses Fi Se  or Se Fi  what the ENTJ votes seem to be doing is misconstruing Fi  so it looks like she uses Se more than it  however this couldn t be further from the truth since her Fi is extremely developed  and the Ni Fi relationship is what drives her  and has the greatest influence on her character s agency and motivation   Fi is an introverted judging function  therefore it relies on a subjective judgment of the world  which forms your OWN judgement of what is morally acceptable behaviour  what is good  and what is bad  what i m observing on makima s profile is that people are judging makima s behaviour in relation to the feeling function through a universal lens on morality   what behaviours are acceptable and what is good bad  makima is objectively a bad person  with bad behaviours and bad morals   she kills for personal gain and she manipulates without regard for people around her  all in pursuit of her own higher purpose  however  to makima  this isn t morally unacceptable behaviour  she views herself and her behaviour as choices that will inevitably make the world better  which tells us she s aware of the actions she takes  and she s aware of the cause and effect of them on the world    SHE  therefore  has her OWN judgement of what is morally acceptable or not  and what is deemed good and bad  which is the definition of Fi  introverted feeling is not about what is objectively good or bad  it s about what someone s personal belief of morally good or morally bad behaviour is  for example  even though to the eyes of the reader denji is the force of good  and makima is a force of evil  makima herself finds denji  disagreeable  and  not worthy of chainsaw man   which suggests she has her own strong conceptualisation of what is good and what is bad  the actions she takes  and the role she plays are intrinsically Ni Fi  and probably one of the clearest examples of it in all of anime  the tertiary function works as a  helpful co determining influence on consciousness   and this is exactly how we see Fi manifest in makima  her Ni s higher purpose meaning for life drives her thought process  actions and conscious decision making  and these are communicated to the objective world through her use of Te  tertiary Fi has a  co determining influence on consciousness  by leaking in her subjective judgments beliefs on the world  which are highly utilitarian in nature  to her dominant Ni  which brings them into the forefront  Ni Fi  and explains why her higher purpose and plan for the world  Ni  is motivated by her own beliefs of good bad  Fi    Fi isn t low enough in her stack to be the inferior function  and she doesn t indulge in Se the same way an ENTJ would  makima almost trades her usage of Se for an insanely potent use of Ni Fi   there s not one scene in the manga where she prioritises Se over Ni  Fi or Te ,intj
Enneagram Subtype argument  Makima has unfortunately been given the   control treatment before  but that was fixed recently which I am glad happened  I won t be arguing over  w   w  as to me  the core type is the most important and wings don t really play that big of a role  However  looking at the IV consensus  after reading more about the enneagram subtypes  I d have to disagree  First off  it s understandable as to why she got typed as sx    Sexual Ones focus on perfecting others  This One is more of a reformer than a perfectionist  They have a need to improve others  but don t focus on being perfect themselves   This  at first glance  seems to fit her very well  Makima s entire driving force is trying to perfect humanity in the way she sees fit  She sees the imperfections in people  those being death  hunger and things alike  and works towards fulfilling her perfect vision of the world  However  an aspect that got ignored here is the fact that social  s can also be very reformative  as well as the fact that sexual  s are described as the most intense   subtype  To elaborate more on this  let s take a look at some parts from various sx  descriptions    This is the only One subtype that is explicitly angry and so is the countertype of the three One personalities  The Sexual One is impatient  can be invasive  goes for what he or she wants  and has a sense of entitlement  These Ones have an intensity of desire fueled by anger that motivates them to want to improve others     SX Ones may express anger and frustration directly when these efforts to improve others are resisted     We would say that a sexual E  is characterized by a special intensity of his desires that makes them compelling  vehement  If we want to understand why anger in the sexual sphere results in this jealousy  we can say that anger enhances desire by making it aggressive  In other words  anger gives any desire a special strength and intensity  so that the person feels not only strongly drawn towards its satisfaction  but feels that he has a right to it  The result is a type that is characterized by a strong spirit of dominance and conquest   Looking at these parts of the descriptions  we can see how it falls apart for Makima  Makima isn t someone who s explicitly angry or visibly aggressive  she s rather calm  too calm  even  The only time we ve seen her visibly frustrated was near the ending of the story  that s about it  And due to this  I believe it s not that good of a fit for her to be a sexual    So  let s rather look into the social   instead  The social   had been given the title of  Superiority   It is a character different from the other subtypes  In certain descriptions  it has been said that the social   can take the role of being a perfect example for others  however  this is not not always the case  Social ones want to bring attention to what they believe is good  right and appropriate  are very systematic and have high self control  they act as if their form is correct  which we could apply to Makima with how much she believes in her vision of a perfect human society and how she ends up forcing others to conform to her own idea of  perfect  standards  Another thing to note is the fact that sx s usually tend to  perfect  those around them but so s tend to do so for entire systems or societies  In Makima s case  she basically made an entire plan to reform a society in the way she seems fit and forced others to adapt to her way of thinking  not by using intensity or anger  but just either by manipulation  or her devil powers  However  even though I don t think Makima is a sexual   primary  she still shows more sx  sp  traits  so her secondary instinct would be sx   The so sx   is the most outwardly focused type of    along with sx so     completely set on reforming and perfecting the world around them  rather than perfecting themselves  This is why I believe Makima is sp last  as she isn t someone who focuses on perfecting herself  but rather the imperfect world around her  So to conclude this  Makima is an   core so sx  As for the weakest part of this argument  we can compare Makima to an obvious sx   Kageyama from Haikyuu  and another reformative social    Light Yagami from Death Note  Makima has way more similarities with Light than she does with Kageyama  Both Light and Makima calmly manipulate others into adapting to their perfect stance  while Kageyama outwardly reacts to everyone who he sees as imperfect and is very prone to anger and isn t calm at all unlike the other two   Sources used  Enneagram subtype descriptions by Claudio Naranjo Enneagram subtype descriptions by Beatrice Chestnut Enneagram subtype descriptions on Integrative  ,intj
SPOILER ALERT     In chapter    Pochita reveals Makima s true motivations  she always wanted to form relationships of equals with others  but being the demon of control people feared her or ended up seeing her as a superior being  that is why her admiration for Pochita one of the strongest demons  she believed that Pochita could fill that void  even in chapter    when they are on a date at the cinema and see a scene of two people hugging  both Makima and Denji cry  which confirms what Pochita said   So it seems to me that Makima is too in touch with his emotions to have a inferior Fi  It even also shows how she uses Te as a servant of her vision Ni ,intj
SPOILER ALERT   It seems to me that Makima loses to Denji due to his Inferior Se  In chapter    Denji explains to Kishibe why the surprise attack technique worked  in which he intuited that she does not remember the faces of individuals and only remembers the essences of the people she is interested in and she did not recognize Denji s smell because she was only interested in Pochita  In addition  at the scene of the surprise attack  judging by the distance between her and Denji s hiding place  it seems to me that if she had been aware of her surroundings  even without knowing that Denji was hidden  she would have enough time to react and try to dodge the attack or launch a desperate attack to defend himself  which she did not do ,intj
Ehhh  looked through the comment section  ENTJ arguments are good  well done  Very on point comparison to Light    All I wanna add  and this is pretty subjective  is that she just    doesn t feel like INTJ  I always get the overall vibe at first  and my gut feeling about a character s type usually doesn t let me down  only then i start looking more deeply into functions  With INTJ characters  no matter if i like them or not  I recognize them immediately  I feel some kind of emotional connection even with the most        up INTJs  Makima just didn t make me feel that  Her Fi is so  so low  oh boy  It s an immediate turn off    Anyway  I feel like the best Te   Ni and Se   Fi arguments were already given below  Pls  don t be biased  esp if you just want to have the same type with her  and read them   ,intj
here i am again  his  top functions  are both ne and ni  like me eheh  but other than thinking that he prefers ne over ni  i also think that he is a ti aux  and definitely not a te aux  but yeah idk maybe one day ENTP house will win  lol  and stop saying that he s sociopathic  he s not  like wilson said once he wishes he was  so that he knows he s like that for a reason he cannot control  so that he has an excuse for acting non human like  But he does feel  he does feel pain  empathy  remorse  anger    he just doesn t want to feel those type of emotions because it hurts  that s why he acts all witty  fun and sarcastic  he s not antisocial or autistic he s just a broken         who happens to be a genius  he s obviously severely traumatized and depressed  but being a piece of      doesn t make you a sociopath   i really think he is an ENTP  he gets the most out of the box ideas  he only accepts cases which are new  weird and fun  he learns from every clinical mistake  he doesn t accept just one outcome         I can also see his inf Si  his vicodin addiction and his peculiar ways of avoiding physical pain more than possible  the things that might let people think he s a NiTe may be the fact that he has very strong opinions and doesn t believe in miracles  like he doesn t believe in god  but that s a pretty weak reason tbh ,intj
i don t understand how can people tell he is an ENTP when there is clearly no sign of Fe in his character  he s much more of an Fi tert user since he is often pushing his ideas onto people and won t let go what he thinks is right  also his Ni Te use is very obvious ,intj
There s no way this guy is ILE  He s as Si polr as it gets  LIE D imo ,intj
I don t think he can be an INTJ  too much energy and impulsiveness  countinusely exposing himself to risks  like insulting others    etc  I don t see him being an ENTP either  the way he menages others Te   his type of cruel sharp wit  He s not argumentative  per se   maybe polemical fits better  he tries to force people to see the truth Ni  or he plays with them  but it is a  fight  about deep concepts    Same type of Aristotle  Elon Musk  and my philosophy professor   Robert California from  The Office  and Molly Bloom from  Molly s Game  ,intj
You gotta be a clown to think he s an ENTP  Ni is pretty much the main basis of the show ,intj
As someone who has seen every season  House is very comfortable around people  sure he likes his time alone but that can very much be said about all ENTPs    Prefers or rather only solves problems he deems interesting over ones that are conventionally important   Ti   Te Unconventional solutions crazy ideas new  unthought of ways to treat diagnose things   Ne   Ni  Would rather draw    than follow any kind of authority    While I think yes he does prefer Fi over Fe  one would have to overlook his clear preference for Ne  Ti to make an argument for INTJ claiming he is a loner ,intj
Sure house is witty and clever  but his main thought process is focused on understanding the underlying way things work  This is not explorative  it instead it concerned with narrowing down ideas into a percieved objective truth  This is Ni Te  not Ne Ti   And ENTP will have Fi polr  this typically presents itself as having an inability to define one s values and preferences  House is constantly forcing his opinion onto people  not caring about how they are affected and prioritising a mixture of wanting to be right  Fi  and what is percieved to be true  Te     The biggest thing is that Fe makes no sense  He is recluse and struggles socially despite understanding people on some level  He understands people clinically  not in an empathetic sense that is prominant with Fe users  Everytime he deals with people he does whatever he believes will lead to the best results with the least effort  this is Te being proactive where Fe would find an effective route that supports a level of group harmony ,intj
just because he is smart doesn t mean te aux the bad fe terc is clearly,intj
While I can understand how someone just getting into the series might mistype him as an ENTP  the more you watch the more obvious it becomes that he s an INTJ  His Ni is the driving force of the series and basically its premise  along with his inferior Se  Even though aux Te and tert Fi are perhaps less obvious  it s clear that he has no Fe  E  is also obvious   and his disintegration to   and Se grip is SO clear ,intj
People have to be a special kind of stupid to have to believe House is ENTP  I swear all of you are over the argument that he is clever witty and doesn t take serious things seriously  I consider this symptoms of House s almost sociopathic mind  not symptoms of being an ENTP  ENTPs make rude and quick witted comments for the fun of it  House has fun with his rude remarks  but ENTP genuinely cares about how their remarks will effect everyone else  Ne Fe  House is far more objective and systematic and goes with the idea and attitude of  I am right  you re wrong   Something that is stereotypically INTJ Te Fi  If you think that House is ENTP  you re thinking by type descriptions  not actual cognitive functions   He may come to conclusions that seemingly come out of nowhere like Ne  i am aware of the differences and the thinking styles of Ne and Ni users  I am aware of difference between Te and Ti  I am aware of the difference between Fi and Fe  And I can clearly see that he uses Te and Fi as his judging functions  and there is no way in hell that ENFP is a possibility  It might be biased  but he is an INTJ   The lowest votes of ENTJ and INTP makes ten times more sense than ENTP  If it was confirmed that House is indeed a psychopath  I would believe to feel inclined that he could still be ENTP  But obviously INTJ doesn t mean psychopath that is completely illogical  nor does psychopathy correlate to anything pseudoscience  He just lacks any empathy to have Fe as a tertiary function   EDIT  Found out that House has ADHD  so now I understand why people are typing him as ENTP a bit more now  but that excuses barely anything ,intj
Stop voting wrong to make jokes  He is clearly an ESFP ,intj
Wrong   its ESFP,intj
what do you call a gamer INTJ that lives in a castle ,intj
Voting my mom s type ,intj
what is wrong with the people who are voting for INTJ ,intj
Regarding Socionics      Stereotypical INTJ  Lazy  withdrawn  abstract  indifferent  but focused on his areas of interest  INTJ ILI  Example  Oreki Houtarou of Hyoka   INTJ perfectionist  Visionary  efficient  entrepreneurial  ambitious  goal focused  introverted  but knows how to take the lead  INTJ LIE  Example  Khun of Tower of God   Strict INTJ  Eager to perform  methodical  disciplined  unfriendly  but true to his beliefs  INTJ LSI  Example  Shinya Yukimura of Rikei gai koi   INTJ nerd  Intellectual  rational  analytical and democratic  INTJ LII  Example  Near of Death Note   Emotional and idealistic INTJ  Which can be confused with an INFJ or ISFP  INTJ ESI  Example  Kurapika of Hunter x Hunter   Serene and calm INTJ  That it doesn t feel so intellectual or strict  and gets confused with ISTP  INTJ SLI  Example  Kihara Tsumugu of Nagi no Asukara   Authoritarian and possessive INTJ  Uncommon  but likely  INTJ SLE  Example  Accelerator of To Aru ,intj
I would honestly say that INTJ is low in intellect in Big Five  because most of you guys seem very closed minded  almost like ISTJs                                                                                           CHANGE MY MIND,intj
Unless we re voting our type combos here  I personally think that the archetype of INTJ itself is more enneagram         https   www personalitycafe com threads naranjos character neurosis ennea type v          Enneagram   s passion is avarice  They tend to hoard a lot of material objects  or just things in general  it can be knowledge  skills  etc   and distance themselves from socialization  They are very misanthropic and schizoid   While INTJ s can be like this  inferior Se technically rules it out as INTJ s do not have much attachment to material objects due to this  INTP is the better archetype for    since they do have tertiary Si after all   the description of Sixes seems far more related to INTJ      fear of not surviving  fear of aloneness in a threatening world   Inferior Se is generally defined as distrust in the physical world  so INTJ s resort to their inner world  Ni  to cope for this   Sixes would utilize patterns and possibilities in order to anticipate danger  INTJ s Ni would channeled towards this process    an obedience to law  a devotion to fulfilling responsibilities as defined by external authority  a tendency to follow rules and to value documents and institutions   This is also HEAVILY related to Te  A Six s dutifulness  hardworking as well as its attachment to external systems and communities tend to be Te like   Sixes are also attached to their loved ones and ideals  in fact heavily attached  almost dependable  they will do everything they can in order to please them  This is a clear sign of Fi ,intj
 w   ISTJ but more abstract  w    w  but more submissive  w   INFJ but more logical  w   The Anti INTJ  w   Ambitious and Showoffish  w    w  but more reserved  w   INTJ with developed Fi  w    w  but isn t perpetually in a loop  w   Typical INTJ  w    w  but less emotional and more skeptical and strategic  w   Same as  w   w   Basically if ISFJ tried to be an NT  IDK  that s the only thing I could think of     REDACTED   w   ENTJ but more introverted  w   Sigma Male INTJ  w    NOTMYINTJ  ENTJ   w   Same as above,intj

Probably the best depiction of Introverted Intuition I ve ever seen ,intj
oh  huh i relate to him quite a bit so far  but our typology is so different  slight disappointment rip   his whole dedication is to saving his energy  it almost makes me think he could be an sp sx    but i dunno,intj
Idk this character and idk this anime but holy      we are identical  I m literally everything  i haven t done the Big    SLOAN  or socionics test but everything else is the same  I even look like him irl ,intj
I believe that his portrayal in the novels is different from the anime  mainly concerning his methods of reaching conclusions  I didn t read the novels  but from what I ve argued about with people quite a while back on this page  I understand that although his Ni is extremely apparent in the anime  along with a healthy Ti for any core     it is non existent in the novels  and his moments of epiphany  Ni  are replaced with streams of brainstorming of various possibilities  which would show a very clear Ne   Again  I did not read the novels  so I don t know how accurate this is  I m just bringing a different perspective to the table of discussion  I ve discussed how he uses his functions in various episodes quite deeply a while back  so I ve already had my argument for INTJ ,intj
Can any INTP voters maybe give me a good insight on Fe inferior  I d love to know what your opinions are ,intj
Just a thought that I posted on PerC  yes  I said it and irdc anymore  about Oreki Houtarou s type in general  since it seems to be a misunderstanding between him being an INTJ or just a straight lazy ILI that might seem to be an INTP ish in a way    I noticed that you emphasized the step by step as if you were to presume that INTJs are unable to do these things  And if you have watched the episodes thoroughly  it should ve been understood that Oreki doesn t exactly perceive the environmental patterns consciously  he nearly didn t even have evidence to give a solemn proof  as he thought that he was just being lucky or just  knew it   INTP s analysis is particularly clear  they don t think to  just  solve problems but rather to breakdown every single detail of logics in front of them to be conjectured as small particles of substantial thinking in their mind  and that s what Oreki lacking at  he perceive the facts and structures automatically  unlike Ti  and to find the clues and evidences  he uses his deductive skill inductively  by using the known facts and seizing which one is better than another  A good example of this was when he made a new scenario for the killer back to the episode about a documentary movie  he dismissed the facts that he deem to be unimportant  changing back to the perception of his own intuition to find the  correct  or  seemingly important  according to him  His strive for the accuracy that usually Ti has isn t just really there  only strives for the result  or so long his conclusion makes sense  doesn t matter when it s right or not  this is something that Te really lacks thereof as they only see logics to express the common sense  His train of thoughts about being special could also resemble his Tertiary Feeling  seeking for the values  but comfortable with his  preservationist  ideology  ,intj
Has anyone considered core   instead of core   for his Enneagram  I thought the descriptions of a self preserving  w  described him pretty well  if not more so than  w  ,intj
im sorry but the people explaining INTP dont really see to understand the functions properly for some reason u all are mistaken clear se and ni as ti when this guy literally bases his detective skills on te se and lives his life because of his ni fi,intj
SLI voters need to understand preserving energy is not the trait of Si  I think we need proper analysis of this character My opinon    I don t see ne valuing for him and role function doesn t nessecarily need to forced  it is only when new situation arise  and even creative function is situational nor ignoring se    Fe polr is obvious concerned with efficiency    I think we understand the socionics also works with axis like lead and role function are connected  he spent the whole day trying to figure out what the school announcement was about   it is so rare for him to be interested in something  i think people need to understand ni seems to strong to be role and si role seems to make more sense ,intj
Are people voting him Inquisitive in Big   because he s intelligent    Openness is composed of the facets Fantasy  Aesthetic Interest  Emotional Orientation  Experimentation  Intellectualism and Diversity Tolerance     More info and elaboration  https   www idrlabs com articles         the big five traits and subtraits    He d score pretty rather low on openness  and even then  he definitely fits the term  non curious  to a T ,intj
voting INFP bc i m an INFP and my favorite color is black,intj
I love surrounding myself with anything black  even wearing this color feels fulfilling  It feels like giving life to something others may find lifeless and enigmatic  It s like being a bright star illuminating the dead night ,intj
Any other color I wear for style withers over time  Black is the only color that can sustain its fashion  for me at least,intj
ME because my turtle got out of the cage once and wattled into a mud puddle that actually turned out to be tar which was black and we couldnt get the color of his shell so we just went with it and that was the beginning of my emo phase where I started listening to INTJ artists like XXXTentacion and Lil Huddy and that was when I felt as if I truly discovered the meaning of life ,intj
    of my clothing  I don t know what it is this color makes me feel but I really enjoy wearing   seeing it   The thing  I love without question  most  since as long as I can remember   but I don t think I am a dark or edgy person ,intj
i do like black  it s flattering on anybody     but the thing is  i wear it too often     i wanna switch it up  black is a perfectly moody and sharp color but it doesn t always reflect who i am or what i m feeling   idk if that made any sense but yeah  i m still a fan of diluted or muted colors that aren t too bright or tacky ,intj
Black and white are my favourite colours  Such absolutism and boldness is seldom seen in other colours   I like it ,intj
Pov  you re cool,intj
Matches easily Doesnt harsh your eyes Low profile,intj
Nothing better than wearing my black hoodie ,intj
 Kyoko is a stoic  intelligent  and mysterious girl who tends to hide her feelings  She has a calm demeanor and tends to be completely unfazed by most of the events that occur  even at the sight of a dead body  At the beginning of the game  Kyoko often keeps her distance from the other students while investigating  Prior to the investigation to find the way out with no casualties  Kyoko doesn t seem to cooperate with the other students and does most of the investigating by herself  She plays major roles in solving mysteries of the culprits in Class Trials and is also one of very few students that see things objectively and doesn t jump to conclusions in the trial  making her a valuable ally to Makoto   Kyoko is very very sensitive regarding the subject about the Hope s Peak Academy s headmaster  who later is revealed to be her own father   going as far as to even lose her cool and react with anger when Alter Ego mentioned the possibility of him being the mastermind  She also doesn t like it when people keep secrets from her  as Makoto finds out   Behind Kyoko s stone cold personality  she seems to easily get emotionally upset  which is masked by her strong will  Even under calm situations  she sometimes lets her emotions get the best of her as shown when Alter Ego mentions her father  the former headmaster  and when Makoto refuses to tell her about Sakura Ogami s odd rivalry with Monokuma  assumed that Makoto suspected Sakura s betrayal   Furthermore  there are some moments that cause her to be visibly surprised  and she also blushes at Makoto during some rare situations  She appears to grow fond of him during the game  as she does show him her hands  after explaining that she only shows them to people she considers her family  During her Free Time Events  Kyoko says that her emotions work fine but she deliberately hides them to make herself really hard to read  but also to give others a calm and composed person to lean on       This is not Melancholic first ,intj
why is she typed as egocentric ,intj
kirigiri is the biggest INTJ icon i ve ever seen,intj
no matter how many INTP arguments I read  I still dont understand Ne   Ni  I can see where her Ti is but her way of thinking feels more convergent like Ni  I remember her displaying Ni   Te a lot especially during investigations and trials,intj
Why  w   I believe  w  fits her more,intj
Hello  Since the last INTP post is based only on DR   I would also point out that Kyoko addresses some of her thought process in DR Kirigiri too   Sensing danger is my specialty  But  when I do sense it  it s often nothing more than a simple  bad feeling  or  foreboding   and so frequently it s only in looking back on events that I am able to string together a logical explanation of events    extract from a fanmade translation  there might be some minor errors   To me  this sounds a lot like a good Ti Si dynamic  and  given that in DR  we also get to know how her intuitive side works  as explained by the other user  I would even more suggest a good balance between Ne and Si  which both go under her Ti s examination  as we see in this quote   Also  to support a hypothetical Fe  I think that we should heavily consider that  as we see in DR Kirigiri  most of her work ethics and values are actually injected in her through her family  more precisely her grandfather  This goes as far as rejecting her father because his point of view on this didn t line up with the Kirigiri s  I really don t think that an Ni Fi user would be this adamant in accepting all of this   Lastly  since Fe would be her last function  we should really focus on how her trust and emotional issues are rooted in her in every DR iteration  which would explain her troubled relationship with such function  Her actual character development blossoms thanks to Makoto  an  hypothetical too  Fe user  which managed to help her addressing these problems  The result is a Kyoko  as we find out at the end of DR   but most importantly in DR   more willing to approach situations with an empathic and trustful way  trying more to share her emotions with others  smiling  hugging  etc     In conclusion  not only I think that even though she s a troubled character  she does not display Se inf dynamics throughout all of DR  but it would be hard to think of her as a Ni dominant person  considering how she explains that every possible path is valuable during investigation  By seeing her as a Ti dom and Fe inf character  we could actually give a more coherent fit with how Kodaka conceived her development  a troubled emotional girl that tries to hide her weighty feelings  but learns to deal with those and trust issues by relying on her group   PS   this is my first post on this site  and although I read the guidelines multiple times  I m not sure on how many arguments I have to bring to the table to keep my post up  Also  I d be glad if you guys corrected me if my typing arguments were wrong since I don t have many occasions to confront my opinions regarding mbti  my uni colleagues that study psychology don t use this system   I hope I can learn more from this  thank you  Edit  please  also read my answers to the user CaligulaOnager s comment for more on Ne and Fe ,intj
can anyone explain her Ni  When i first saw her I immediately thought she was Ti Ne though i don t really remember It s been a while since i last played,intj
I m gonna make a case for INTP because I m in a disagreement with the current votes  be it ISTJ or INTJ    I m pretty sure I m gonna have to re explain some basic MBTI concepts down the line  so bear with me  At least that s the approach I chose to use    With a grand total of    INTP votes  I m in the minority here  so feel free to explain why I might be wrong in the replies     It s gonna be a pretty long ride by the way  And a not very organized one at that lmao ,intj
I think that Kyoko Kirigiri is probably  w  because she was obviously a skeptic rather than an utilitarian  She merely behaved outstanding reasoning and analytic abilities in court and seriously found relevant evidences in each investigation  but she was seemingly neither trust her strange classmates  nor advocate any personal opinion in public  Therefore  she didn t positively join any social activities with her classmates in the closed school  She d consider to solve trouble problems with her classmates if she was really a  w  utilitarian  The relationship between Kyoko Kirigiri and Makoto Naegi was seemingly based on trust and loyalty  She sometimes doubt him whether a trustworthy teammates to shake her cooperative decision ,intj
Besties  have we considered Phlegmatic Choleric  I ve already established in the replies that I think it s incredibly unlikely that he s Melancholic Choleric   Where did we even get that one from in the first place     I m here today to write about Tsukishima Kei for way too long  since I haven t seen any prominent temperament arguments  Babes  I think as a society  we need to just realise that he is a phlegmatic blend  and in this comment  I m here to explain why     I really get that he doesn t really look like a stereotypical phlegmatic  since he s not accommodating  but hear me out  His main struggle during the series can basically be boiled down to the fact that he starts off too passive  unmotivated  stubborn and apathetic  all flaws people with phlegmatic blends struggle with  His entire arc in the series revolves around his journey to becoming passionate in volleyball  Tsukki just follows the classic phlegmatic character development  from someone who stays in the background  to someone who gains the passion and drive to dedicate themselves to something     As well as his unhealthy phlegmatic traits  he has many positive traits associated with phlegmatics  since he s careful  cautious  methodical  contemplative  studious  and impartial  And maybe some of this might be my own character interpretations seeping through  but I genuinely feel like Tsukki is quite a calm person  Like  I feel like a lot of his strengths come from his abilities to methodically create strategies and systems in the background while retaining a level head  Even though he has a rougher exterior  he s just sarcastic or passive aggressive at worst  both which are phlegmatic traits as well   I just feel like a lot of the Haikyuu fandom fundamentally misunderstands many aspects of Tsukishima s character  and the mel chol typology reflects this   Recently  I ve seen a few people in the comments question why he has choleric in his blend  Honestly  to start off with I also questioned this  but then I started looking at what the two temperaments look like when they re placed together     They are accommodating  industrious  and independent  loners   The Phlegmatic Choleric will have a firm  stoic expression  flat affect  and will rarely smile  They are calm  steady  and persevering  They can be very blunt  stubborn  and sarcastic  They rarely show emotion or affection   Self explanatory   The Phlegmatic Choleric wants to operate by themselves and set their own pace  Once their mind is made up they will resist any other method of approach   Tsukki is quite a stubborn and single minded individual  and this is made evident by his initial relationship with volleyball  To start off with  he refused to properly participate since he made up his mind about the sport after the whole thing with Akiteru  Even when he became more invested  his strategies still revolved around singular methods  as opposed to flexible and adjustable tactics  During the Shiratorizawa match  he created a strategy to take down Ushijima  and waited for the duration of the match so it could properly play out    This focused individual brings a deceptively intense approach to the task  Being low key outwardly  their involvement in a task is not easily observed  They are successful because of their commitment to completing a task  After starting a project  they are tenacious and will fight for their objectives  The Phlegmatic Choleric is very independent  questioning  and thorough in their approach and will follow through to see the task completed    After he becomes involved in volleyball  it s made apparent that Tsukki has the capabilities of becoming committed and tenacious when he cares about something  Another example from the Shiratorizawa match is how he continued playing  even when his hand got hurt  because he wanted to see Karasuno win    In the replies  I ll cover my reasoning as to why I just don t think that Tsukki is melancholic choleric  This is much longer than I thought  but I hope this convinces you   ,intj
why melancholic choleric  he barely has any choleric traits,intj
can someone tell me how this man possibly has chol in his temperament  ive only seen this guy get somewhat mad like twice and its just his irritation  the only times where hes acted like a leader too was that one time during the shiritorizawa match or however you spell it where he clutched up after returning from the paramedic  can someone also explain why hes inquisitive as opposed to non inquisitive  i dont ever recall him being interested in gaining new knowledge besides that one moment showing his character development where he asked kuroo or whoever like how to block better or something,intj
Guys do you think INTJ     is possible in real life  How would INTJ with that tritype differ from the more common INTJ     combination ,intj
tsukki s natural lack of Fe is so         hilarious lmfao although it did take me a good while to get used to his   humour    despite being a stereotypically cocky glasses dude  he does use his function stack steadily and healthily from beginning to the end of haikyuu  and the way in which he gradually matures throughout the series   opens up to others is actually quite endearing     I haven t gotten to observe an INTJ in the wild  so much for being one of the rarest types   so his inner character development helped to open my eyes a bit ,intj
TSUKKI NICEEEEE  one of my favorite characters ever  his development was so  so beautiful  i can see INTJ for sure and think  w  especially fits him very well  the top best comments really helped me understand the   in his tritype  so thank you to everyone who took the time to explain that    ,intj
J  vi cada coisa engra ada na internet  mas uma das mais hil rias foi Tsukishima ISTJ e Kageyama INTJ  n o me fa a rir ,intj
Wait  Huh      in his tritype   I thought he was      And no he s not     either       Aha  lol alright   started to make sense       ,intj
Why is he  w  and not  w    gen  edit  someone explained thanks ,intj
i was initially gonna send this as a reply then accidentally it got too long so i got shy but i ll try to condense the sp sx arguments in this comment  there r comments from a while back but i m sure if people were willing to scroll so far there wouldn t be three different comments asking about it  lmfao  sp sx   from oceanmoonshine   The self preservational instinct accentuates the self contained  withdrawing tendencies of the Five        On the down side  they have more disdain for people and little use for the social aspects of life  They want to be left alone or they want to share their inner world with their intimates  The intensity of the sexual instinct is reserved for their intimates and even there it is sporadic  The self pres energy gives this subtype a solid foundation and some degree of practicality   These Fives are conflicted when it comes to experiencing and expressing emotions  They usually default to emotional repression and to detached intellectual analysis  This is a dynamic common to all Fives  but with the self pres sexual instinctual stacking  the balance of these forces is pretty precarious and it seems as though the scales are being constantly adjusted one way or another  As the social instinct is the least developed  the social arena gets the drier more intellectual approach almost by default    that describes tsukki REALLY well  but to put into perspective  he really doesn t care about the social arena and getting along well with the group  it s not a priority of his at all and he barely makes any effort to get better at this  ever  he doesn t think of his  antisocialness  as a problem and it also never really plays a larger role in the story  he s obviously clearly so blind  and it has nothing to do with his level of health  he s so blind and that s fine  when it comes to having sx in his stack  it actually plays a large role in his growth in the story  he has always treated people who have so much passion with disdain  hinata and kageyama are sx first  and compared to how he deals with being unsociable  which he doesnt deal with  cos its fine   we see him struggle a lot from seasons     with the idea of passion  it exists in his mind literally all the time  we know he is aware of sx  he is just consciously trying not to tap into it i guess  because of the whole backstory with akiteru  making him rely heavily on his primary self preservation stacking  as he grows in the story or rather  in order to grow in the story he allows himself to enjoy activities that he knew deep inside he enjoyed but just wasn t honest to himself that he did  it s not just a club       also  though it took   seasons  it was actually only half a year in universe  which is a pretty short time and normal timespan esp for someone his age to develop his secondary iv  i m just clarifying this to say that tsukki is pretty healthy lol  in case some people think  tsukki is sp so  he s just unhealthy  lol cos he isnt  he s just fine  ,intj

The Chad Cold Weather vs The Virgin Hot Weather   Chad Cold Weather    Is chad  based  Cools your hot chocolate so that it hits just the right temperature and at a faster rate  Forces you to put on fluffy coats   Gives you hypothermia so that you don t feel extreme pain if you freeze to death  If you freeze to death you become a stoic and Chad like ice statue  Virgin Hot Weather   Is virgin   cringe   Melts your ice cream before you can even take a bite  Makes you sweat  cringe    Forces you to strip down  but you can t tear your own skin off so you just suffer   Gives you heatstroke when you least expect it  If you die you decompose into human sludge,intj
i just love sitting by the fireplace with blankets on me  cuddling my dogs and drinking hot chocolate  such a feeling of comfort and i love it ,intj
I love staying inside and sipping hot coco and having an excuses to wear my hoodie all the time,intj
The fashion is lovely as well as the temperature    ,intj
Hot weathers make me sweaty and i do not like being sweaty,intj
he s the extreme of what a     INTJ could be,intj
Completely agreed with INTJ  but why choleric melancholic  He comes off as melancholy choleric  though he wasn t one to wallow in his misery like Schopenhauer  I m also open to him being a     rather than a     but I m not entirely sure  He was certainly very iconoclastic and world rejecting and I suppose that tritype fits such a personality ,intj
His factual aspect is not Te  It is nothing of an objective judgement  It is extremely subjective and it should never be taken as being objective  What he is objective about is feelings  Nieztsche has strong urge to affect his readers in terms of value judgement  but not so in logical way  I wonder who would take Nietzche s monologual analysis by words  I believe that Nietzsche himself hadn t intended his logic to be taken by words and trying to read Nietzsche focusing on logical aspects only yields immediate contradictions and confusions  It is also contradictory to assume his INTJ persona to be his personality for Nietzsche died as a virgin  whereas addressing himself with some strange misogyny of which is clearly not his social stance  Same goes for his poor attempts to incorperate contemporary scientific discoveries to his writings which is introverted all the way  and any man who can think both logically and objectively would have noticed his fallacy instantaneously   But it is unfair to criticize Nietzsche for his lack of objectiveness in terms of facts for his main interest was on aesthetics  His writings still bears problem that the writer was mocking some queer academic varient of an  bermansch which adds to the reader s confusion even further  I admire Nietzsche as a critic  philologist and by his philosophical insights  but not much as a philosopher ,intj
Alright  first of all  I believe that SP   is quite clear  the sense of practicality to hide one s emotion  And I don t think that he doesn t fit the descriptions of SP    as in  being attached to the idea of enduring themselves for the sake of sacrificing themselves and in accordance to the existentialistic approach  the way he considered that the God is dead and decided to  kill him  seems to be        I mean  if you were to take a look at Sartre s  No Exit  as for example  it s quite different  the void of black hole in   and   seems to be that kind of decisive role in determining whether someone is an existentialistic by nature or not  Hence it seems to me that  since   decides to fill the empty black hole to create something    refuses to do so and instead  seemingly to create something from that nothingness alone  As for the        his main belief about  refusing the authority as an objective truth  as it revolves around the aspect of Apollonian and Dionysian  doesn t seem to be   s approach in accepting the certainty of logic  as in  creating a new philosophy to become something that consists knowledge    And his approach towards nihilism  seems to be a   core thing  but to me  this is the result of Over Adventurer aspect in the Domain of Activity Social Work  which rather to emphasize that the God is  killed  for a bigger purpose  which is to create a better world  And at last  I saw the Spiritualism aspect in his nihilistic approach  I didn t see   or    doesn t seem to be that active in remarking what it means to be true or not  justice or revenge  but rather  it blends within the multiple perspectives of confusion that I believe fits        maybe   fix is possible but I really don t think so   The statement that  God is dead   occurring in several of Nietzsche s works  notably in The Gay Science   has become one of his best known remarks  On the basis of it  many commentators regard Nietzsche as an atheist  others  such as Kaufmann  suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity  Scientific developments and the increasing secularization of Europe had effectively  killed  the Abrahamic God  who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years  The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright nihilism  the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose  Nietzsche believed that Christian moral doctrine provides people with intrinsic value  belief in God  which justifies the evil in the world   and a basis for objective knowledge  In constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible  Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism the despair of meaninglessness  As Heidegger put the problem   If God as the supra sensory ground and goal of all reality is dead if the supra sensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power  then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself    The verdict   Existentialism       Passive Nihilism       Perspectivism    ,intj
So there s   points about Nietzsche s typing that can be debated  if he really is EIE  if he really is so blind  and if he does have   on his tritype and not    Now starting with the first it is well known that Nietzsche was a bit of a workaholic  and really devoted to study  He sometimes ignored his health because of this  specially when he had an insight into a new perspective  This could indicate that Nietzsche is a Si PoLR nonetheless there s a detail that is missing from the equation  that is  Nietzsche was very aware of how surroundings could distort his health and comfort  In Ecce Homo he explicitly stated that things like weather  temperature  food and other elements of surroundings could have a high impact on our perception and our way of thinking therefore he looked for places that provided him with the comfort that is necessary for healthy perception and thinking  This valuing of comfort and health shows that Nietzsche was  althougth not primarily focused on comfort  very much aware of it  I think Si role  and thus IEI sociotype  would be a much better fit for him  There s also the point that we could better explain his obsessive writing with Te PoLR   His performance strongly depends on the mood and situation  it can be difficult for him to force himself to do the necessary work  is prone to bouts of laziness   Nietzsche not only wrote endlessly when he was struck by inspiration  but also when he loved a subject  this can be seen when he pass Latin just because he got interested in poetry in his student years even thought he was the  worst disciple  in the class   Now on the second point  is Nietzsche so blind and sp dom   We could definitely make an argument that Nietzsche is by no means sp dom  He not only wrote books that he knew would not be successful and bring him any gain to improve his living  but as we saw earlier  wrote even if that meant sometimes going against his comfort  There s also the fact that Nietzsche was very conscious of social harmony  mentioning in the Ecce Homo how he valued diplomacy and etiquette  something that he admired from his father  and hated the lack of it in his mother   and he very much loved seeing himself as part of selected groups  his small circle of friends which included Wagner and even the constant mention on his writings that he wrote for a selected few who would understand the magnitude of what he was saying  After all that s the premise of Zarathustra   Here s a description of social E       But the passion of the social E  is something akin to the need for the essential  the sublime  we might say  rather than the need for what is there  Totem indicates both height and character of being a constructed object rather than a human being  The height of a totem   bersmench  evokes a tendency for these people to look up  towards the ideal  and to relate to the most outstanding and outstanding among people  something like Midas wanted everything he touched to turn to gold  The tragedy is that  by seeking social E  a super value  it implicitly despises ordinary life and ordinary people   Finally  is Nietzsche a   or   fix   I think there s lots of reason why people could see an   fix  the main one being The Will to Power  Now there needs to be a more precise understanding of what power meant for Nietzsche  Power doesn t mean control for him  it means expansion  potencial  the ability to create  Deleuze on his book on Nietzsche explicitly said that dictators are the opposite of the ultimate expression of the Will to Power  because they don t concentrate on the most important  creation of values  Now Nietzsche had contempt for compassion and he preferred pride and respect over the former  But this was not so much because of love of strenght  but more because of consistency with values that he saw were the healthiest  master morality   The strong should not pity the weak  because in pity there s not real respect rather a hate that mascarades itself  Nietzsche s obsession with society adopting values that he saw were the healthiest and more coherent with life itself is the real motivation for his master morality and Will to Power  not really a desire for strenght or control ,intj
I don t know much about the guy himself  but his philosophy is the epitome of introverted intuition and social five     Social fives are looking for the ultimate meaning in life  motivated by an underlying  potentially unconscious  sense that things are meaningless unless the ultimate meaning is found      They see a gap between the ideal and everyday life  and they burn in the longing for the ultimate meaning    Nietzche knew that the idea of life having no meaning was going to destroy the human race eventually  and the idea of meaning being destroyed by science tortured him for most of his life     Introverted intuition apprehends the images which arise from the a priori  i e  the inherited foundations of the unconscious mind    This image fascinates the intuitive activity  it is arrested by it  and seeks to explore every detail of it  It holds fast to the vision  observing with the liveliest interest how the picture changes  unfolds further  and finally fades    Eventually  Nietzche found the answer to the quandary presented by so  in the two concepts of the  bermensch and Will to Power spawned from his Introverted Intuition  The Will to Power can almost be interpreted as a psychological meaning  similar to Adlerian psychology  one s main psychological goal is to rise above self doubt and self hatred into the subconscious image of the perfect man above all  Subconscious and personal concepts transmute into subconscious images and aesthetic shapings of the self ,intj
Nietzsche is like the epitome of Fe blindness and how the Te Fi axis works to shape the world  His works remind me of Sartre  who is also an INTJ with huge Fi usage  Nietzsche despised group thinking  he believed people have to distance from the crowd in order to have clarity  and he valued independence above all else  This is a demonstration of his Fi and lack of Fe   Another point is that types that are in the Te Fi axis hold that truth is shaped by people   There are no facts  only interpretations    so people are to take matters in their own hands and make what they believe in become a reality  while letting results speak for themselves  This is manifested in Nietzsche s theology that  God is dead   because when enough people distance themselves from the belief of God  which was the phenomenon at the time  it makes God cease to exist  There is no unmovable singular truth as truth is objective  meaning it can be actively changed  as in the MBTI definition of objective   Therefore it s never enough for each person to just perform their own unique strengths in the best way and be good at their own respective roles  like Ti Fe users would usually approach things  but rather people have to really dive into the system and help to maintain it  Nietzsche s focus was always on the direct relationship between individuals and the bigger system  the things  Every interpretation of something has a risk of polluting it  ruining it so to speak  like the culture and music that Nietzsche openly criticizes        Te Fi user with zero Fe usage  Dodges Fe like the floor is lava    lmao,intj
Extremely schizophrenic INFJ manifesting repressed ESTP traits through literature  Practically worships Se  not Te  as a response of never managing to master it in real life  His entire work is a highly symbolized  Ni  understanding of Fe Fi social systems  not Te  go read Marx for that   Carl Jung is essentially Nietzsche if he dropped the poetry and mastered his schizophrenia  Nietzsche worshipped the Abyss until it swallowed him whole  Jung brought it to light   Gets typed INTJ because a million mistyped ISTPs think their Se Ne PoLR is actually Te ,intj
 F and  E makes   sense  Nietzsche was very detached from the physical world and wasn t nowere unbothered by his emotions ,intj
obvious Ne dom with unhealthy Fi,intj
PLEASE JUST STOP TYPING NAGITO IN FOUR LETTERS  IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE AND HAS   SENSE WHEN THE INTJ ARGUMENTS ARE BASICALLY  Hes insane and edgy  made a whole plan to fake his dead  XNFJ makes more sense to me  but still if you played danganronpa   pls remember that all the fuss about Nagitos character is not knowing wtf is going on his head and how weird is his thinking process  he is insane and literally changes and plays with his functions  please make a poll to just close the votes for Nagito s myers briggs type and keep him as XXXX im tired of entering to this page and see him as trending topic AGAIN without getting nowhere cause is a fact that this guy is impossible to type ,intj
 English isnt my first languange  im sorry if i make any english mistakes  I dont have any idea on what his mbti type is but isnt he too close minded to be a ne dom  From what i have heard ne is all about being open to new ideas and solutions while he is very strict about what he thinks is right  i do get that its probably because he is very unhealthy  but i still dont get the ENFP votes  please correct me if im wrong,intj
To anyone who thinks Nagito s behavior is out of character for an Fe user     I think we should at least CONSIDER that he s NOT a normal  well adjusted person  and he s not in a normal  everyday situation    What I mean by this    is that normally  you expect people to act in their best interest  That s why we expect Fe users to want people s approval  to want people to like them  Right    But Nagito s situation is COMPLETELY the opposite  His motivation  is exactly the opposite  Normal Fe users are trying to get people to be their friends  to like them  But Nagito is trying to get his classmates to KILL him    He s flat out said that he s suicidal  island mode   He wants to die  and he wants to die in a way that helps others  his classmates  and the greater world at large via the creation of hope   He wants them to kill him    Now I m not saying I can t be wrong  But it actually makes more sense for him to act in a way that upsets them  because making them dislike him is actually MORE IN LINE with his goal  He s not TRYING to get them to like him  He s TRYING to get them to kill him  So is it impossible that he would act in a way that would facillitate that  That he might act in a way that MAKES them dislike him  And then chock up the misery of their disapproval as the price he has to pay  as he internally glorifies himself as a selfless outcast   And it fits  He was a model Fe user before the killing game started  He acted like Hajime s mom  dragging him around and making the shy introvert introduce himself to everyone  politely threatened TeruTeru to defend Mikan  got teased for being too genuine and cheesy and seeming like he d be a good stay at home dad  telling everyone to quit fighting  But when it stopped making sense  when he suddenly stumbled upon a suicidal opportunity to die in the name of something he believed in  he totally flipped  Put on a face  flipped back and forth between seemingly totally different personas   It helps explain his flip flopping   pours heart out   I just want someone to love me   nvm that was a joke do u wanna kill me now     his wildly contradictory behavior  like how insane he acts to motivate everyone to split up in Ch   but how strangely gentle he acts when you talk to him     for an FTE   all the stuff you get a lens into when you actually get to PLAY from his perspective  his metaphor for being the soil that nurtures them all  his weird sense of responsibility and need to go into the final dead room because it s too dangerous for anyone else  his heartfelt gratitude for Nekomaru s sacrifice     Again  I could totally be wrong here  But I m just saying I KNOW his behavior doesn t fit the expected Fe mold sometimes  I m just saying    what if there s a very good reason for that    TL DR  Maybe Nagito does things that upset the others because he WANTS them to kill him  and making them dislike him is actually a good way to do that  Maybe he s an Fe user who ISN T trying to get people to like him  and that s why he doesn t act like you would expect him to ,intj
Why would he be so sx   so sp though  I don t really remember any sx   traits in him  tho please correct me if I m wrong,intj
I m sorry if I m being rude  Enneagram   is a pure description of high Fi  In that case  would he be an ISFP that uses his Ni in a healthy way or not  I never watched  Then you ask yourself  Why is a person who has never watched it is commenting   well  it s just that INTJ uses his Fi  but it s not his favorite  While NiFi draws conclusions from your feelings  FiNi analyzes your feelings  Maybe if I watch it  I can change my mind    I also see many people confusing Ne with Ni or Ni with Ti   ,intj
he is too crazy to type  even thought i can see his Ni clearly by he is guessing so well and by his plan,intj
INTJ argument  I ve noticed the INFJ votes have been increasing  even though the arguments aren t that convincing  The descriptions of functions I ve been seeing here lately are completely unrelated to actual Jungian Functions     Fe Ti and Te fi I will begin by copying some of the definitions of those   functions by Carl Jung all taken from his book  The Psychological Types on a simplified language    then I ll explain why he uses Te Fi over Fe Ti  Extraverted Feeling  Fe    An extraverted feeling type may feel obligated to call something  beautiful  or  good   not because he personally finds the thing in question to be so  but because it is fitting and polite to call it such insofar as the situation is one where a contrary opinion would disturb the general emotional atmosphere  A feeling judgement such as this is in not a lie  but rather an act of accommodation A picture  for instance  may be described as beautiful because it bears a well known signature and is therefore generally assumed to be beautiful  or because calling it  ugly  might offend the family of its possessor  There is a benevolent intention on the part of the visitor to create a pleasant emotional atmosphere  to which end everything must be felt as agreeable    Introverted thinking  Ti   Introverted thinking at the decisive points is always orientated by subjective data  External facts are not the aim and origin of this thinking  though the introverted thinker would often like to make it so appear  It begins in the subject and returns to the subject  though it may take the widest flights into the territory of the real and actual  Hence  in the statement of new facts  its chief value is indirect  because new views rather than new facts are its main concern  It formulates questions and creates theories  it opens up prospects and creates insight  but in the presence of facts  it exhibits a reserved demeanor  As illustrative examples  objective facts have their value  but they must not prevail  For this kind of thinking  facts are of secondary importance  what is of paramount importance is the development and presentation of the subjective idea  and to see how external facts fit into  and fulfill  the framework of it  This kind of thinking s creative power is evident in how it can create that idea which  though not present in the external facts  is the most suitable  abstract expression of them  Its task is accomplished when the idea it has fashioned seems to emerge so inevitably from the external facts that these facts actually prove its validity      Fe  opposed to what I ve been seeing here  isn t about manipulation  seeing through people s emotions or caring about people  it s about agreeing and taking societal values as your own  it seeks approval just as much as Te seeks validity  Fe is just as objective as Te  the difference is that Te is about objective facts while Fe is about objective values and seeks to be agreeable to maintain social harmony  Since Fe is highly empathetic  they seek to avoid conflict as stressing emotional environments affect their own mental state  high Fe users usually avoid expressing their own opinions and subjective reasoning formulated by their Ti to maintain a good group atmosphere   The concept of Fe goes completely against Nagito s character  The whole reason why his classmates don t like him is because of how much his values differ from the group and society s own standards  and he IS NOT afraid to put his crazy ideals out there  Actually most of the emotionally stressing situations in the group were caused by Nagito himself because he doesn t absorb their feelings like an Fe user  so the negative atmosphere doesn t have an impact on his emotional state      I haven t seen any argument regarding his Ti  so I ll use Nagito s views on society and explain why it can t be a product of it  Ti needs to understand how the world works  so one could argue that his views are based on him simply explaining how society works  but that s not how it works  Ti breaks concepts down to their base to get a full picture on the mechanics and why it s built that way  but Nagito doesn t wish to understand how society actually works  his views aren t based on analysis  they re based on formulas created by his black and white moral code      Open replies for part   and  ,intj
His personality type is basically mental illness  he s too unhealthy to just be correctly classified on a single one   ,intj
I m voting INFJ  Ni Fe Ti Se  as Nagito is clearly a heavy Ni user  His decisions and plans all come from an Ni framework of putting together his conclusions and information he has gathered  whilst still being able to maintain a mask of being perfectly fine on the outside    When we are first introduced to Nagito  he is eager to talk to everyone and assesses quickly what kind of people everyone is  using his aux Fe to  feel  everyone out as soon as he meets them   He also uses Ti as his  hobby  function with the logic systems and ways he tests others  through the class trials in the games  but also by asking lots of questions and being very clear in what he knows to be right wrong   Inf Se is clear in his overindulgence in the whole Hope thing and he clearly has a more standoffish view of the rest of his classmates   However  he is mentally ill and may have a personality disorder so it may be unclear whether or not he actually can be typed  But I feel INFJ for the reasons above ,intj

Do you guys think Fyodor s tritype might be     instead of      If otherwise  I would like to hear why he s more of a   than a   in the heart triad  As of now  I don t have any arguments for      I just thought of that possibility on a whim   Edit  Okay  I ll actually try to give an argument for his heart fix  Please do note that this is just a feeble attempt to explain his heart fix and tritype  I lack some resources to properly explain his type  and I ask your pardon for it  You can definitely educate me tho  I might play devil s advocate in an attempt to explain his heart fix          At first  I can t seem to fit   in him  like I can t see any Melancholy or Envy in him  I don t think that he s also the type to find or relate his identity with this and that  well  except for his god complex and demon persona   I ve also read some descriptions about the     archetype  especially         descriptions  and I can t really just seem to fit him in there  After thinking of the possibility that his heart fix might be   instead of    I ve read the descriptions of both E  and E   comparing them to see what is seen in Fyodor  I also tried researching both     and     archetypes descriptions just to compare them  Surprisingly  I can see the     archetype in Fyodor more than the     archetype   Alright  That was just an introduction  Let me now explain why he is        First off  let s take the fixations into account  E  s fixation is Vanity  while E  s fixation is Melancholy  According to what I have read  I forgot the site  I just keep on clicking sites to cross reference what I ve read   Vanity  strives for degrees  positions of importance  power over others   This can be seen in his personality  where he sees himself above humans  therefore thinking that he is or is equal to God  Also  this mindset of his is shown when he thinks he is given the authority to rid the people of their sins  which is their abilities  In the Manga  there s this line where he said   In my case  you are given free rein as indicated by the right hand of God and the demons   Based on this line  it would be most probable to think that he sees himself as someone with high authority and superiority  which would describe Vanity s  strive for power over others   For the passion  which is Deceit  maybe it could be related to his god complex where he considers himself superior to everyone  and he still maintains this self image or something  I m actually thinking that he may be thinking if he isn t as superior as he thinks  he would be stripped off from the  authority  to rid the sins of the ability users  But since the guy s hella intelligent  devilishly intelligent if I may describe it  such high self image is possible  Also  for his Trap  we can see how efficient he is in his plans  like EVERYTHING is already planned out  Also  given that both   and   are in the image center  it s possible to misidentify them since both are image conscious  He may look like a   because of his withdrawn individuation  but I believe that is already from his   fix  Fyodor doesn t have a  negative self image   if we may use that to describe E   That s my side of the coin for       ,intj
don t know how the votes got flipped to  w  when fyodor doesn t even fit any of the   subtypes at all   the closest subtype is social   and even then the description doesnt quite describe him well   For Social Fives  the passion of avarice is connected to knowledge  These Fives don t need the nourishment relationships provide because their passion for knowledge somehow compensates for what they might get from direct human contact  It s as if they have an intuition that they can find everything they need through the mind  Needs  for people and for emotional sustenance  get displaced into a thirst for knowledge The name given to this subtype is  Totem   which communicates their need for  super ideals   or the need to relate to people who share their intellectual values  interests  and ideals     While social   explains Fyodor s decision behind forming the DOA  an organization full of ability users who supported his cause  it isn t really his ultimate purpose  Moreover  Fives can be quite static and choose to observe rather than engage  Fyodor doesn t really fit this description  while he is calm  he is very proactive with his beliefs   so let s take a look at social one   The Social One is less of a perfectionist and focuses more on being the perfect example for others of the right way to be  This One is not an internally anxious person striving to be perfectionistic  but rather a paragon of correct conduct  Social Ones have a need to represent the perfect model of the way to be or do things through their actions to teach others by example  Ichazo labeled this type  Non adaptability  and Naranjo calls this subtype  Rigidity   describing the Social One as having a kind of  school teacher  mentality  Non adaptability or rigidity refers to the tendency of this character to rigidly adhere to particular ways of being and doing things  as a way of expressing exclusive ownership of the  right  way to be  think  and behave    Now this however  perfectly explains his entire motive behind everything he does  Fyodor having a holier than thou attitude towards all ability users  believing them to be sinful and trying to eliminate them in the name of the lord s will    all of these actions perfectly align with the social   s motivations,intj
     Alright  hello everyone  After a while of thinking about Fyodor s enneagram type  I ve come to the conclusion that he s a social one  As always  I m going to try my best to prove it    Let s start off by comparing the head triad and the gut triad    Head Triad     These are people who have a fear of fear  Living in the mind is a way of avoiding the emotion of fear  These points then use their minds as a form of protection against what is perceived as a threatening world  As a style  the fear points move away from people      Sometimes called the  doing  group  these people are always dealing with a strong polarity between doing and trying to decide what to do  This is also the home of internal dialogue  All fixations have internal dialogue  but the fear points   are especially addicted  Their powerful absorption with inner ideas or objects tends to prevent them from taking clear  decisive action    Gut Triad     Sometimes called the  being group   the central issue for the anger points revolves around the mistaken belief   I am only human   Being is identified as the human body  All problems  maladies  calamities  and suffering flow from this basic ignorance      The first and deepest rage is the rage of being incarnate in an animal form   Above that is rage at the Father for doing it to you  All other emotions follow from this core emotion of rage  Believing that  I am my body   and having suppressed both the primal rage and the blame of the Father  conflict arises between being  myself  and being controlled by others  This conflict manifests as patterns of defiance  control  and obedience     While Eights and Nines may appear quite unkempt   you may find piles of dirty laundry  old pizza boxes  and empty beer cans lying around   Ones are obsessively neat looking  Everything looks perfect  and their clothes may take on the appearance of a uniform      Fyodor is definitely not someone anxious  He s quite the opposite actually  He s fearless and able to sacrifice anything to achieve his idealistic goals  Everything he plans or does  remains perfect  everything being in harmony with his views    Why   core     core  Take a look at their passions and traits   CONTINUATION IN THE REPLIES,intj
i m not entirely sure why the consensus for him is  w     just because a character is a smart and tactical INTJ doesn t always mean they re a   core     his character design gives me extreme gender envy  ,intj
i think he is a  w     core  s are constantly paying attention to flaws so that nothing is perfect and experience continual frustration with themselves  others  and the world for not living up to their standard of perfection  to satisfy this fixation  their ideal state is one that is right and balanced  being at peace knowing that the self and others are perfect  imo social   fits Fyodor very well    social  s express resentment by focusing on a broader model of the  right  way to be  Fyodor s entire character is centered around his ultimate goal of creating a balanced right version of society  that being one without ability users      social  s consider themselves to be perfect to an extent  feeling  sometimes unconsciously  superior to and becoming frustrated with others who do not live up to that standard  Fyodor has a savior like mindset  believing himself to be the messenger of God s will  that  will  being to fix society by eradicating ability users   and he repeatedly criticizes the  sinful nature of man      the anger of these  s is known to translate into a cooler more intellectual personality type  which is why I believe he was originally typed as a core    while he does have some core   traits  the most prominent being the social   s  super ideals  that they use to critique the  ordinary  and give life elevated meaning  these  s would never openly seek recognition or pursue their goal in the way that Fyodor does  I think that if he were a core    he would be more on the sidelines about his ideals rather than openly striving toward his goal  although he is constantly pulling strings from the sidelines  he tends to involve himself in his own plans  a core   would most likely remain watching from behind walls and allow others to carry out the plan  but Fyodor becomes an active participant because he believes he has a duty to a higher power that only he  the divine messenger  can fulfill  he compares others to himself and finds himself the only one ultimately capable  others  ex  the DOA  serving as tools in the pursuit of his ultimate goal  just the fact that his goal serves as the overarching conflict in the story is telling of his determination to elevate the world to his standard of perfection  while he may have some core   traits tendencies  his   core is his primary motivation and his fixation on perfection is overriding  ok slay bye,intj
Could someone please explain to me why LIE ,intj
why are you guys trying to prove her as Ti dominant when she literally shows a lot of Se grip,intj
Why             She does genuinely seem to take great issue of being humiliated or feeling out of her control  It s been a while since I saw the show but I don t see much   behaviour besides holding incredibly high standards for herself which is a result of unhealthy      and LII ,intj
why RLOEI rather than RCOEI ,intj
I think she is a  w   because fours often have passions or interests in various topics  for her it is chess  and she is often withdrawn into her own world  especially when she spirals into her binges  ,intj
I think sp  is very clear  but why sp sx over sp so   sx  likes to find close  intimate and passionate relationships with others  especially in   to   scenarios  They enjoy the intimacy of these relationships  and they are often very romantic    so  likes to find people with shared interests  and share their knowledge with them  often engaging in debates and discussions  They like to see things from several points of view    When we think about how she interacts with others  i think social   makes more sense as the second instinct ,intj
People are confusing her Se grip with secondary Se  Yes she has good Ti but Se is what she uses when she s at her worst  Think of when the step mom died she went into a full smoking frenzy trying to distract herself from the world  That s pure Se grip,intj
why   as her gut fix  i thought her tritype would most likely be       she s spent a lot of her time playing chess in her head or alone  which means she is accustomed to her own techniques patterns that she derived from external sources and herself  due to the constant success of her techniques  she grew self confident and she believed her current method was the best way  because it was Hers  not because she thought it was the  right  way   not to mention her love for life s pleasures and her tendency to become impulsive  type  s are more averse to pleasure fun due to their moralist standpoint and strictness with themselves  one instance is her tournament in Paris  the night before her match with Borgov  she was invited by Cleo to go and drink with her   s would simply refuse since they know it s  bad   considering that her biggest match is the next day  she still considered this  however  she went with her impulses and decided to drink anyway  i know this might correlate more with inf Se  but i think it s still worth mentioning    i think the general description of the     by Katherine Fauvre fits her    The     see life as one giant chess game that they intend to win through mastery  quite literally   They succeed not because they do not have emotions but rather because they are not limited by emotions  They will always have or will readily develop a strategy for success  They have a defense strategy that survives by learning from their experiences so that they can succeed the next time they face the same problem  Emotionally charged experiences that result in feelings of shame and humiliation leave the strongest impressions  As a result  these are the areas of life that the    s wish to conqueror first    TL DR  Beth s desires and fears are more aligned with the     than the     ,intj
Her se grip makes it too easy to type her,intj
Te  Sang woo is a practical thinker  He has a goal of repaying his debts  and he will do anything to achieve it  He is able to treat other people as his tools  sometimes even literally like pushing a man on glass to pave way for himself  During the Tug of war competition  he was able to make a quick pragmatic decision to make the other team lose balance and thus secured victory for his team  Te Ni Se all in action   Sang woo is also quite arrogant to the point of accusing Ali of cheating or earlier stealing money from his clients to invest in the futures using his mother s real estate as collateral   Ni  Sang woo often has a good intuition  When he was informed that the guards were cooking something  and he spotted four different symbols  he instantly realized that the next game will be Dalgona  However  Sang woo seems to be too bold and reckless with some of his decisions to consider him as a Ni dom  like stealing money from his clients to invest in futures and ignoring possible risks of that    Se  Sang woo can act quick on his feet and make good observations of the present  During the first game  he quickly noticed that the doll will not detect movement while you stay behind another player    Fi  Sang woo has a poorly developed moral code  mostly justifying his action by merely trying to survive  He usually doesn t take morality into consideration  however  he can be sometimes briefly haunted by his wrongdoings ,intj
he s more se fi and te ni,intj
Why is he a            There are already quite a few eight fix arguments  but where does anyone see the five  He hasn t shown any avarice   nor does he withdraw  asides from protecting his image due to his three core  and break apart existing structures  He s one of the most  active players  in the game  immediately playing the games and adapting to the rules  Sixes are generally more action oriented  fives need more time to feel prepared because they like to deconstruct   Comparing the temptation and defense mechanisms between five and six just convinces me that he s         Temptations   The temptation of Fives is knowledge  For Fives  knowledge is power  Immature Fives think they can secure their lives by being informed about everything in as much detail as possible     The temptation of the Six is their exaggerated striving for security  Sixes are  devil s advocates   They have a sixth sense for absurdities and suspicious elements    As for defense mechanisms  sixes work around their fear by mapping out action oriented strategies  as opposed to fives who withdraw and try to prepare themselves with avarice ,intj
I ve already forgotten most of the details of this show  but here goes anyway  Sang woo doesn t have tertiary Fi  He is motivated by the ideal of success alone  Many unhealthy ExTJs are motivated to simply do  to accomplish  without any input from their morals to guide them  They are doing for the sake of doing  It is productivity gone mad  He committed fraud and sabotaged his own success for   what exactly  More money  most likely  but not to put any ideals into motion  just to have the money and status    He also showed no ideas of how he would shape the world  He really was moving forward almost on autopilot  just continuing on because what else was he supposed to do  Te without Fi is efficiency without direction  merely checking items off a to do list without a reason for making those lists other than to have the lists ,intj
Se inf   yall for real   he s literally so quick to judge his surroundings lol,intj
I don t know where you guys see Fi ter on him  he s a truly ENTJ,intj
I initially voted INTJ for Sang woo  but after some thought and seeing more arguments about it  I believe ENTJ is most fitting for him  other than the scene where he s in the bathtub and is essentially drowning his sorrows in alcohol and smoking them away  I don t see much evidence for him having inferior Se  rather  inferior Fi seems to be the most applicable for him  given how his entire character arc and development throughout the show is him becoming increasingly ruthless and devoid of any internal moral system in his efforts to win the game  the ultimate dominance of Te over Fi,intj
I m not saying ENTJ doesn t make sense  because it does and I may change my vote  but I m confused by the whole  inferior Fi  arguments  I would argue that the teritary Se arguments make more sense   Inferior Fi argument  No offense  but you guys act like this character had no morals to begin with  He definitely did have morals and wanted to do the right thing in the beginning  trying to save people with the rule vote  helping Gi Hun with the beginning match  and even giving Ali money   I wouldn t say these were calculated moves to get him further into the game  because if it were so  then he probably wouldn t have helped Gi Hun and left him to die in that first game  and that doesn t match up with when he decided to not help him in the second game along with Ali   I m not saying that he doesn t have inferior Fi  but the whole  he was a bad guy in the end so he must be an ENTJ  argument doesn t make sense to me   There are plenty of INTJs who can override their Fi and let their Ni Te take over  so I m not sure why it can t be the same case with a character like this    Besides  it was pretty obvious he was uncomfortable with the immoral stuff he did in the beginning  He almost told Gi Hun about how to solve the puzzle in the second game but decided not too  but what s important was that you could see that he was clearly struggling in that moment on what he should do  which probably means he was more aware of his emotions   Also  we have to take the context into place  because he literally has a lot to lose on the line  Any normal person under that kind of stress of being in such debt would probably try and do what s logical and that was just Sang Woo in this situation  He s a realistic portrayal of what we would all probably do in a game like this   Se Teriatry arguments The teriatry arguments with Se make much more sense in my opinion  but even with that I have some skepticism   Sang Woo is adaptable sure  but there s nothing to suggest that he likes or prefers being the person calling the shots and being open about directing events to go towards his way   In fact  we can see that he hates any sort of attention since we can see he gets super annoyed whenever Gi Hun states that he s a top notch student towards the other players   He seems to be more so the type of person who likes to stay in the shadows and make sure no one suspects him so that when the time is right he can strike and take down people   However  this isn t a strong argument which is why I think Se Tertiary works better for the ENTJ voters         Look  at the end of the day  I m not saying ENTJ isn t valid  but I do think there has to be some logical consistency involved in the arguments you re making   Just because he decided to push down his emotions doesn t exactly mean that he s automatically an ENTJ   Not only that  but at the beginning when he s clearly depressed and overloading himself with sensory activities  binge drinking  laying in a bathtub with his clothes on  smelling smoke  wouldn t that be more indicative of Se inferior break ,intj
It is obvious they have inferior Fi  I don t understand the INTJ votes lol ,intj
Effy sin duda es INTJ  creo que las personas que dicen que son ISFP se basan solo en las funciones cognitivas que presenta  sin duda alguna es  w   adem s para los que hemos visto de verdad la serie se puede ver un claro ejemplo de Ni insano  un ejemplo de este fue cuando paso lo de Kattie  ella quer a que todo mundo le diera la raz n y que se estaba defendiendo a pesar de que claramente estaba pensando solo en ella  es una persona muy arrogante con todos y se cree lo mejor de todo y tiene ese complejo de superioridad  luego el loop de ni con fi se ve en los  ltimos cap tulos de la temporada    cuando desconfiaba demasiado de freddie a pesar de que el le quer a ayudar  tambi n a adido la depresi n psic tica que presenta  y tambi n presenta Se grip  ya que siempre va buscando vivir todo al m ximo pero despu s se arrepiente de sus errores  En cambio el eneagrama se ve f cilmente  suel ser seria  reservada  de sentimientos demasiado fuertes  pero en vez de expresar como se siente  prefiere quedarse callada y no decirle ni a Michelle que le trat  de ayudar  ni a tony o su mam   o Freddie  pero ella sabe perfectamente que le pasa y que siente en su interior  en vez de eso prefiere mostrarse grosera e intelectual  esto por la acumulaci n de sentimientos que tiene dentro de ella ,intj
I think she is an INTJ  based on the arguments   but definitely  w  and not  w   that s so obvious    are objective  reserved  non materialistic  sometimes basically numb to sensations  seriously these people live in their heads and are occupied with thoughts and ideas  Effy is not such a person for         lowkey just wannabe saved from all the misery  which they created for themselves in the first place   My other guess would be    I could totally see that  too  I mean  fear of being controlled and limited etc ,intj
let s compare him with Sid or Maxxie from gen    they re pretty much the opposite of her  she has too much Ni  it can t be her tertiary function and she always used Te more than Fi  she s basically like her brother  and what s wrong with people who vote her as sexual  w   w ,intj
well i wasnt expecting to have the same tritype but alright just from the descriptions of her an unhealthy sp  makes so much sense,intj
she is INTJ in skins fire which means she was INTJ all along she was just a mentally ill teenager,intj
En mi opini n Effy es un muy claro ejemplo de un Ni insano  para los que enserio vieron la serie deber an opinar que Effy es un  w ,intj
Effy was introduced as Tony     back on S   both schemers  night life people and also competent and polished  Effy is seen as this mysterious girl who barely talks and when she does it s always something metaphorical or emotion based  She likes having fun and both of her episodes show that a lot  She can scheme like her brother  we see in S  how she could pull the strings well with most characters but that could be the only Ni like argument we have here   On Gen   we see more of her  and it gets a little difficult with her mental issues becoming worse and worse  However her first storylines are all about getting high  choosing between two guys and her internal conflicts  Notice a pattern here  Basically all of her plot lines have her act in the moment and then we see the impact it has on her emotionally  A huge contrast to Tony who we see from the first episode how he organizes  plans and deals with the problems or ideas at hand  The  Ni dom in a grip  argument sound convincing but I need more arguments for Ni and Te to fully believe them   So the question is    where is her Te  We see a lot of Se from the siblings but way more Fi on Effy  Being a player and mysterious isn t an Ni thing  it literally can be linked to both types  ISFP  INTJ  being introverts   I m rewatching Skins and I m currently on S  so when I get to S  I ll decide  I think typing the more grown and healthier version of Effy will reach to a better conclusion,intj
why would she have Te aux  that makes no sense at all  also   core and INTJ with  F and  L  INTJ has Se inf  it makes NO SENSE with  F   core with  L is also really weird ,intj
you know when people voting for a type dont know anything when the tritype is unmatching like people that vote for  w  probably doesn t even know what it is a tritype to vote   ,intj
sorry to disappoint y all but she s definitely an unhealthy  ,intj
Curious where the LSI voters found the Se here  He s pretty Si and his Fe is far too weak for an LSI ,intj
there should be more people talking about his socionics  hes definetly not an LSI nor an ESI  debatable   Se in the ego block as a valued contact function doesnt make sense  perhaps hes an ILI  his ego block makes so much more sense that way considering his already discussed use of Ni  his lack of Se  and also his Fi  all of that just based on the theory    about the ESI thing  ive changed my opinion  hes not an ILI  but my thought on LSI still remains  im open to listen about it ,intj
im glad were close to get him typed as an      in other aspect  i think hes an obvious Ni Dom  but not by the reasons some of u are giving  his  theories  about midoriya being all mights child or him having two quirks are an obvious use of Si  which he uses a lot  but it has an explanation ill give later in the comment   notice how both of his  theories  reflect his own experience and past  he assumed all of that because thats exactly what happened to him  his father quirk and his two quirks  its panifully obvious seeing him use Si  i think even though how much he used Si its not exactly valid to type him as an Si Dom or say he uses it as a main function  because the only reason of his use its his trauma  his Si is different from his Ni and Ti Te because he started using it with the time  because of all the trauma   but with the other functions i mentioned  he had to learn to use them almost as an obligation to be more  smart and intellectual  to please his fathers desire of him being a hero  but his Ni was also different  its his dominan function so it developed in a different way  pleasing his father but also kinda himself as well  the same reason of why he lacks Se  his environment  endeavor  didnt need him using Se nor Fe  perhaps its cute how in the present he learned to use Fe more since hes in a new environment with different people ,intj
I swear some of ya ll are so fixated on intuitive bias you act like no intuitive exists ever  This is especially prevalent on Bakugo and Shoto s page for some reason  There are plenty of arguments for INTJ in the top comments and if you can t check them then thats on you    Don t take this Ni dom king away from us  Also you have to remember Shoto was NOT healthy in the earlier seasons and when people aren t healthy they can turn to their shadow functions  so ne si in his case  And his father has strong Si so that def influenced him too  EDIT  just thought of something else  he has a   fix and INTJs with   fixes tend to have stronger Fi     None of them felt it  In that moment  I was the only one who could sense your true power  It reminded me off something  experiencing All Might s quirk    The Ni king himself,intj
Man I wish he had a   fix but he definitely does not  he is never seeking out knowledge to protect himself from the world like a    He seems like he d have more competent     than reactive     types in his tritype but there are no core   motivations in him what so ever  Even tritypes with   as the last one still have noticeable   traits  if anyone has any   fix arguments I d love to hear them but as of now I m         Edit  the reason I couldn t see   traits is because he s self preservation and thats countertype   If I ll be honest I don t see any   traits in him either  It s been a while since I ve seen the actual show so my memory might just be rusty  but he s without a doubt not a   fix and I don t see any   traits sooooo ,intj
I m writing this before bed  I ll probably update with more sources from manga later after I finish this semester  but I d really like to hear others  thoughts on this   I m rescinding my vote for LVEF regarding his APTI    The more I thought about it  the more I realized Todoroki doesn t fit  E    The difference between the  rd and  th position is that the  rd position is both self negative and others negative  while the  th is self negative and others positive  Hence why the  rd position is typically called the Insecure Position and the  th called Unbothered    Yes  his emotions and relationships are typically where most of his problems and insecurities come from  but that isn t enough for him to be  E    E is characterized by rejecting emotional expression both in themselves AND others  Yes  Todoroki is oblivious to social cues  but he doesn t reject or feel vulnerable with regards to the emotional expression of others  unlike Bakugou  who is  E    Yes  it could be because of having Suggestive Fe in his Sociotype  I can t see someone with  E completely going along with what Midoriya said about preparing for the possibility of forgiving Endeavor without at least some initial gut reaction  especially when adding his trauma and baggage into account   And also why I can t see him as ESI  Hence  E   Re evaluating  E made me think about the other positions in his APTI  so I won t vote quite yet  I m thinking both LVFE and LFVE  or even FLVE  are possibilities ,intj
why Ni dominant and why Te aux  i can t see that much Ni on him,intj
Paraphrase of my sp   argument  I m not certain about his instinctual variant but I m certain about his core type    Ones are conscientious and ethical  with a strong sense of right and wrong  They are teachers  crusaders  and advocates for change  always striving to improve things  but afraid of making a mistake  Well organized  orderly  and fastidious  they try to maintain high standards  but can slip into being critical and perfectionistic  They typically have problems with resentment and impatience  At their Best  wise  discerning  realistic  and noble  Can be morally heroic   Basic Fear  Of being corrupt evil  defective  Basic Desire  To be good  to have integrity  to be balanced       For the Self Preservation One  anger is most repressed  To render their own anger less threatening  the mechanism of reaction formation transforms the heat of anger into warmth  And this is a major shift an angry person disconnecting from his anger to become a gentle  supportive person with good intentions  In this subtype  the anger of the One  together with defenses against that anger  manifest as good intentions  perfectionism  heroic efforts  obedience to rules  and an obsessive striving for perfection    The outward result is an excessively gentle  decent  and kind person  In the quest to perfect themselves  Self Preservation Ones believe it s bad to be angry and so make a virtue of being tolerant  forgiving  and sweet whenever possible   I think this describes Shoto to a T  He is always attempting to not be like his father  abusive  controlling  so goal driven he doesn t care about the results of his actions  no consideration for feelings  etc  Hell as a kid he says he doesn t want to be a bully like his dad    He is more interested in being a good and noble hero than anything else    What is the result of him trying to not be like his father    in the show  He is no longer as outwardly angry and resentful  even deku describes him as incredibly kind  A bit blunt with a lack of a filter  but still kind  I ve also never seen him get angry at one of his friends  only at his father and that one police dog   He has created a gentle and kind persona in his efforts to not be like his father  a very sp   thing   Why I m not certain about his instinctual variant  despite my argument here    I don t see him being very perfectionistic and I don t see the anxiety of an sp     Why not type            I m putting this simply for now   he doesn t have the core motivations of any of these types  He doesn t strive to create a unique persona  type     not as interested in gaining knowledge  type     and not as focused on security        He has type   and   in his tritype  but they aren t stronger than his   core ,intj
to the people asking about his    in one of his flashbacks we saw during that fight scene between him and deku he said he didn t want to become anything like his father or anyone who bullies people his left side fire abilities came from his fahter so he stopped using his left side for a while until deku made him do it during the fight ones fear the same thing are ethical and are more interested on being good people heroes are good and thats what todoroki wants to be,intj
 I had an existential crisis at     Yeah he s a   alright,intj
He s a business genius who is good at playing the role of tech bro science genius keanu reeves       His persona is INTP  he plays this nerdy awkward guy but this is a character he plays  not who he really is  His real ambitions are his own value and exposure  I think he knows his ideas are stupid  but he s good at knowing the right things to say   but the sheer bombastic nature of them makes sure to stir up conversation and get himself in the limelight   I m not sure of his true personality type  but I d guess he s an ENTP mimicking an INTP  I don t think his Fe is as weak as its made out to be  and he s constantly trying new things and following new paths to increase his influence  Ne   and the Ti seems to manifest in the sciencey techy side of things   If this is the case  it s interesting  because he reminds me a lot of Bill Gates  as much as he tries to distance himself from the traditional world s richest man persona  Bill Gates is an ENTJ who plays the role of an INTP  I believe Musk is an ENTP who plays the role of an INTP  In these tech positions  the INTP exterior seems to be the most effective method available   This is where it gets interesting  Musk is a Three on the enneagram  Specifically a Social Three  which plays incredibly well into his mimicry of the INTP tech genius bro dude and relation with exposure and being known about  People may see his inroverted character and think he s a Five  but the engine here is Musk is someone who fears being inferior more than anything else  There is an urge to stand above others  I believe Gates is also a Social Three  just a much more traditional PR oriented one  who cares about being perceived as a good person  Musk s Social Three ness is more unorthodox ,intj
For anybody still doubting Se inf  check out this interview  https   youtu be jvGnw sHh M  The way he pushes his  honestly rather bad jokes onto people is a clear sign of Se inf  How he manages to power through the moments of awkward silence after he made a comment  is Fe polr  So is his disdain for the spirit of the times  i e  wokeness and society s focus on emotions over efficiency    On the other hand his clear Fi value system comes through when he speaks on his assets and the tax evasion claims  He states that he has  no offshore bank accounts or anything and will go down with the ship  because  he  thinks it s the morally right thing to do   If he had Fe inf  he would probably give into all the moral pressure coming his way and not stand his ground the way he does   He regards the problem of renewable energy and sustainability as a complex Te system  If one aspect like nuclear energy falls away  he looks at how we can still make it work  Very systematic approach rather than a logical Ti one   Lastly  a few quotes for his Ni    We are the spirit of life   Entropy  the ultimate enemy   fear of Ne chaos  chaos vs order mindset of Ni dom   Our existence is a brief flicker of consciousness in a vast darkness and we should not let that little candle go out   EDIT  Just found this interview where he basically speaks on NiTe problemsolving  starting at the ideal outcome and reverse engineering a way to get there  Starts at the       minute mark and ending at       ,intj

Source  Psychological Types   Extraverted Thinking  As a consequence of the general attitude of extraversion  thinking is oriented by the object and objective data This gives rise to a noticeable peculiarity  Thinking in general is fed on the one hand from subjective and in the last resort unconscious sources  and on the other hand from objective data transmitted by sense perception  Extraverted thinking is conditioned in a larger measure by the latter than by the former  Judgment always presup  poses a criterion  for the extraverted judgment  the criterion supplied by external conditions is the valid and determining one  no matter whether it be represented directly by an objective  perceptible fact or by an objective idea  for an objective idea is equally determined by external data or borrowed from outside even when it is subjectively sanctioned  Extraverted thinking  therefore  need not necessarily be purely concretistic thinking  it can just as well be purely ideal thinking  if for instance it can be shown that the ideas it operates with are largely borrowed from outside  i e   have been trans  mitted by tradition and education  So in judging whether a particular thinking is extraverted or not we must first ask  by what criterion does it judge does it come from outside  or is its origin subjective  A further criterion is the direction the thinking takes in drawing conclusions  whether it is principally directed outwards or not  It is no proof of its extra  verted nature that it is preoccupied with concrete objects  since my thinking may be preoccupied with a concrete object either because I am abstracting my thought from it or because I am concretizing my thought through it  Even when my thinking is preoccupied with concrete things and could be described as extraverted to that extent  the direction it will take still remains an essential characteristic and an open question namely  whether or not in its further course it leads back again to objective data  external facts  or generally accepted ideas  So far as the practical thinking of the business man  the technician  or the scientific investigator is concerned  its outer directed  ness is obvious enough  But in the case of the philosopher it remains open to doubt when his thinking is directed to ideas  We then have to inquire whether these ideas are simply abstractions from objective experience  in which case they would represent higher collective concepts comprising a sum of objective facts  or whether  if they are clearly not abstractions from immediate experience  they may not be derived from tradition or borrowed from the intellectual atmosphere of the time  In the latter case  they fall into the category of objective data  and accordingly this thinking should be called extraverted ,intj
INTP  breaks things down  zooms in  and analyzes the parts   Ti Ne  INTJ  builds things together  zooms out  and analyzes the bigger picture   Ni Te  So which does Elon sound more like  It s tough  as he does the latter sometimes  but I think the first sounds more like him  While space exploration and unravelling the cosmos may seem on the surface quite Ni as a goal  using Te to build towards that end  it is however also Ne if not moreso  as he seems intrigued by the possibilities among the stars  and his endeavors involve a lot of math which is more Ti  He may seem Fi at a glance because he can be quite controversial and has some non mainstream views  But I see more Fe  because he is quite ironic  He uses Fe in a playful way to provoke much like an ENTP would  and INTP being similar sometimes do the same  Despite his meming he still talks sincerely about things like climate change  I think an INTJ would be more idiosyncratic with his views and vocabulary  and openly say if he thought climate change alarmism was nonsense without any regard to how it came across  And INTJ Fi humour is more sincere which differs from INTP Fe ironic humour  Often INTJ are taken seriously when they are joking  and INTP are thought to be joking even when they are serious  which I think is why they are typically seen as more socially acceptable  When Elon discusses things it seems Ti Si  I don t see any Se really  Its a close call  but I go with INTP ,intj
I love how everyone is like ohh INTJs at eso bad and toxic until it s includes Elon then they are like  OH MY GOLLY JOLLY I LOVEEEEEE INTJs  man I hate humanity,intj
Everyone around him described him as a micro managing and controlling person  He never actually designed anything himself  his success came from his extraordinary execution skills and marketing stradegies  If that doesn t scream Dom Te  then nothing does  He had no hesitation while voting the original founders of tesla out of their own company  stole money from early paypal users  and allegedly told his first wife to stop being so dramatic when she was mourning their dead son  which shows inf Fi  He faked his origin story and made up an online persona  It feels like everything this guy does it to achieve success  would it make more sense if he s a   or an   instead of   ,intj

He does not really have a clear and univocal vision of the future or a final goal  but he has different  visions  of how it should be  he is not even focused on a particular company of his  in fact he has several in the most disparate fields  for example Tesla   SpaceX  Neuralink and The Boring Company  and focuses on multiple projects  this is Ne  In his interviews I see much more TiNe than NiTe  he rarely talks about objective data  Te   but he talks a lot about how things work  their structure and composition in general  I remember when he explained the functioning of the Tesla batteries   excels in identifying inconsistencies   flaws   logical errors  this is clearly Ti Dom also would seem to recall information from the past  specifically from its past experiences  Si   lower Fe because hes socially awkard  funny  INTJs are definitely more direct and cold  I haven t seen any really valid arguments for INTJ  and I don t see any valid arguments for tert Fi  many of the comments are based on stereotypes like   he wants to achieve his goals  and  he is focused on efficiency  he manages more than a company seems pretty normal to me lol and INTPs can excel at that ,intj

SHES LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF SP  OHMYGDO,intj
She might look like an INFJ or an ENTP but that s just because she has a shadow of Kanae  It s really obvious of her wearing Kanae s haori  the thing that has a pattern of butterfly texture and a green and pink gradient   Speaking of her haori  seeing her wearing Kanae s haori makes me infer that she is taking Kanae s soul so that Kanae could be peaceful  The other reason why Shinobu is wearing Kanae s mask is that she wanted to revenge Doma for her sister  This is just what I think  Everyone should realize that she is just acting like Kanae  ENTP is not her real personality and stop doing the stereotype thing ,intj
I remember when she was typed as an ENTP  dark times,intj
Writing opinion about the character of Shinobu Kocho Shinobu is a gentle personality like a butterfly  and the butterfly breaks its wings easily because of its tenderness  She has always been sympathetic to the people near and far    A tolerant character who raised and tutored orphaned girls in Tsugoku  If she gets angry with the one she loves  this is because of her fear and concern for them  Kocho remains loyal to her work   For the Legion until the last moment of her life  she did not flee the battle  despite knowing her death from the beginning  in my opinion   Kocho Shinobu was the embodiment of tenderness for everyone she met  Her dream was to fulfill her sister s desire  a desire she knew she would not be able to achieve  She passed this dream on to others who could do it    Like her  even if she doesn t love demons  this is her only negative  being her sister s reincarnation despite this reincarnation   She couldn t hold back her anger that was evident in the end   She was a wonderful character  I loved her  I loved her personality  and I loved this bed  Everyone who met her and spoke to her was   Or for some  and for others  a sister and a friend  and there was nothing left of her but her butterfly hair tie   Sorry if some of the words are not in order  I copied them and then translated them,intj

I can understand the INFJ votes  Shinobu presents a very Fe like mask  especially during her first appearance during the anime manga  However  it s important to be aware that this is not her natural personality  which is shown during the rooftop scene where Tanjiro saw right through her demeanor  Furthermore  her Fe doesn t even come off as natural  Her outwardly caring and expressive demeanor isn t based on her own personality  it s based on her sister  Kanae  who is typed as an ENFJ  She maintains this facade out of a personal desire to have Kanae s personality remembered after her death    Mbti is determined by cognitive thought process  not behavior  So you cannot type Shinobu from the Fe persona she presents  as it barely reflects her actual personality  It s best to type with the motivation   intention behind her actions  rather than her behavior itself  I ve reread the manga regarding Kanao s backstory  and I genuinely can t see young Shinobu as having any decent amount of Fe     Kids who can t think and act for themselves are useless  That s dangerous  They can t do anything on their own    Chapter        She literally says this while discussing with Kanae about a child whom she and her sister just adopted right in front of her  Her first concern wasn t even with Kanao s well being  but how she saw Kanao s reluctance to make decisions on her own as useless  And then when Kanae remains optimistic about the situation  Shinobu s first thought is that she s not being logical  I highly doubt that any high Fe user would say something like that  as xxFJs would be more concerned with social harmony and the emotional well being of the collective    Young Shinobu shows a natural disposition for logic over ethics  She only starts to present as more Fe like after Kanae s death  when she adopted the personality of her sister to honor her ,intj
Shinobu es una INTJ con m scara de ENTP  los que leyeron el manga saben a lo que me refiero ,intj
Why   in her tritype   And why   wing  ,intj
for those confused about her usage of ni ne   it later turns out that she did predict her death at Doma s hand  Thus  with the help of Tamayo  she had began to intake and absorb wisteria flower poison regularly for over a year in the hopes that  if Doma consumes her  he will also devour thirty seven kilograms worth of wisteria poison  which is nearly seven hundred times the lethal amount   from the wiki page     this happens in the manga  for exclusively anime watchers   this is the most obvious example of ni that she has exhibited  as ni se is all about collecting observations  making predictions and coming to conclusions   her tertiary fi is also shown in  Now more determined as a result of the pain and suffering they endured  Shinobu and Kanae both promised to become Demon Slayers to protect each other  as well as prevent other people from enduring the same losses they had to experience   which displays her moral compass and innate hatred for demonkind  she uses te fi somewhat altruistically  in her pursuit of becoming a successful demon slayer to make the world a better place for others ,intj
how is kurapika accommodating    literally throughout the whole series he s been shown to only pursue his goal and not let his personal relationships with others distract him,intj
Kurapika s tunnel vision is his greatest strength and also his greatest weakness  He focuses on his single minded objective of killing everyone who not only stole the eyes of his clan  both the Troupe and the buyers of these eyes   but also to retrieve the eyes so his clan can finally rest  After the massacre  Kurapika spent five years of his life training himself up so he can prepare for the Hunter Exam  Unlike Gon or Killua who joined the Exam impulsively  and unlike Leorio who wants to become a Hunter to honor his past commitments to being a doctor and save people with the money he can get as a Hunter  Kurapika only wants to be a Hunter solely to hunt down the Troupe   Kurapika knows that Hunters  specifically Blacklist Hunters  have the connections  knowledge  Hunters have access to research and information that ordinary civilians do not   and training to capture highly wanted and dangerous criminals  Kurapika chose his specialty very early in his career  He quickly takes up a position as a mafia bodyguard because Neon purchased many of his eyes  and the black auction is a wellspring of both new body parts  additional eyes Neon and others may want  and connections to the underworld  Kurapika subjects himself to multiple punishments in order to make his Nen and Hatsu stronger  such as Emperor Time taking his life  Chain Jail only working on the Troupe and even then only capturing but never killing them  Kurapika would die if he used CJ on anyone else   and Stealth Dolphin and Judgment Chain requiring him to be and stay in Emperor Time for its duration   Kurapika s other abilities also serve a larger purpose  Dowsing Chain functions as his radar and truth detecting device to gather information and locate targets  Holy Chain heals his body and keeps him in peak fighting form even in long and difficult battles against the Troupe  And Steal Chain lets him acquire a useful technique from any target that can serve a future use   Kurapika is almost a genius when it comes to Nen  Unlike the prodigious Gon and Killua  who trained under Wing  one of Biscuit s students  and fought in Heaven s Arena against skilled Nen users to hone their craft  Kurapika trained with a relative unknown Hunter who wasn t even in his category and didn t have nearly as much knowledge on Nen as Wing  In this time  Kurapika surpassed Killua in skill and learned and mastered In and multiple Hatsu  Killua and Gon didn t learn their Hatsu until Greed Island  Kurapika skillfully chose Uvogin as his target due to his desire to fight alone  and him being physically powerful so he can test his Chain Jail s effectiveness on the Troupe and his combat prowess  Kurapika even kept his chains in the open to trick anyone to believing he is a Manipulator  disguising his category and the true nature of his abilities  because he wants his opponent to fight as they would against a Manipulator  Conjurers and Manipulators apply and use aura differently  so the methods of taking each of them would also be significantly different  This would give Kurapika a tactical advantage over his foe before the battle even began   Kurapika also has Te  not caring what personal sacrifices he has to make as long as he fulfills his goals  He immediately took up positions as Neon s bodyguard and Oito s bodyguard  though he wanted Halkenburg due to the latter s connection with Tserreidnich   all to acquire more eyes  He is very methodological in fights  opting to quickly and brutally subdue his targets  His fight against Uvogin was brief and direct  He didn t waste time  Kurapika does everything he can solely for his goals  He even sacrifices his friendships with Gon and the others all to make his ambitions a reality   Kurapika has Fi  only caring about himself and his clan s reputation and honor  He becomes belligerent when anyone insults him  his clan  and what they went through  He brutally attacked the prisoner in the exam who pretended to be a Spider  He was angry at Leorio for his insensitive yet unfortunately correct assessment that lives can be bought with money  He doesn t socialIze with people that much  He even considered abandoning Gon and Killua for his revenge against Chrollo  He worked reluctantly with Hisoka  comprising his values  if it meant killing more Spiders   His murder of Pakunoda is particularly sadistic  as he tortured her for caring about the Troupe  stripping her down and making her obey his commands to save Chrollo s life  He became the very thing he swore to destroy  a thief  when he chose to awaken Steal Chain and Stealth Dolphin  Kurapika has no loyalty to Neon or Oito  he sympathizes with them but he never cares for them  viewing them as expendable so he can get the eyes he covets as his reward  Kurapika even questioned his revenge when he saw how much it pain it put Gon and Killua through  as well as the Troupe s love for Chrollo  But he chose to continue anyway  His personal feelings and pride matter far more ,intj
cannot figure out for the life of me how people are voting him as a Se dom  he s got Ni Te written all over his face,intj
 Why chains  Because there s evil that needs to be chained down to hell    If enneagram   was a person  it would be Kurapika ,intj
i forgot the ep but he was going to follow chrollo but he had an order to get back  so he decided to abandone his goal for now and do his job  si dom for sure,intj
Kurapika is an RLOEI  not an RLOAI  Although he can be kind  affectionate  and self sacrificial  he is usually blunt  provocative  and doesn t mind disturbing harmony  If he was truly accommodating  he wouldn t have clashed with Bisky shortly after they met ,intj
I agree with his enneagram  but why is he so sp and not sp so or sp sx ,intj
 WHERE IS THE FE  did we watch the same show  this ni is HIGH and we all agree on that  but the obvious ni fi loop that we see during the third season confirms that he CAN T be an INFJ  also his te is pretty high as well  the Se is repressed but it s there,intj
am i insane for seeing him as a core  ,intj
I relate with him a lot  even with his anger outbursts,intj
Just Monika,intp
 cries ,intp
Yes,intp
I,intp
my favourite horror anime game  i also love the side stories and seeing a different side of the girls and their character development,intp
monika supremacy,intp
so INFPs they are weird,intp
Sayori is best girl  Yuri comes next  then Monika  and Natsuki is just trash  fight me,intp
The player is an INTP who thought this is an waifu game  joking  OR An INTJ who knew this was an psychological horror game,intp
i love how the majority of us are INTPs lol,intp
    so everyone else has to look at his  some random dude s  butt crack  and im like NO i dont wanna see that  so i pulled down Marzia s window as we passed by and im ready to go  nice ass  dumbass   but she STOPPED me   she says im mean  but im like  im HELPING      he s def Ti Fe because of this lmao  and Marzia  INFP  pointing out to him that its morally incorrect lol plus his Ne is so clear in his minecraft series  he s a clear XNTP ,intp
As a person who was part of the ancient race of the Old Pewdiepie fan  pre             I am more than qualified to type him   Standard ENTP in actuality  He is main Ne  and Ti   which in Socionics sense is a person who sees the best ideas  innovations  and follows learned practical facts   The alignment is Neutral Good  No need for arguments here   The temperament DCNH subtype is what is interesting here  He is a Primary Sanguine Creative for sure  He has a similar comedy approach to Markiplier in that sense  with accentuated Se  look up DCNH subtyping system in Socionics   What made him famous in part is the Se in his comedy  Where he differs from Markiplier is his Secondary temperament subtype   Felix always had this old and fragile aspect to him with his pacified Melanholic spirtituality  Now it seems that it is more saturated in his content and this perhaps is why people type him as a INTP  since in Melanholic Normalizing the Ti is accentuated  The Pandemic Era PewDiePie probably has lost pretty much     of his Sanguinity Creativity in the content   His spiritual Melanholy can be seen through all his Eras  His Pre Golden Age have a certain kind of chill  which Phlegmatics Harmonizers like myself would not have  He probably holds habits and ideals a long period of time ,intp
Yall cant look at this man and say he isnt an ENTP ,intp
Real talk how is he not a  w   He seems to      prioritize comfort  Where is his gluttony ,intp
Honestly I think he s an ENTP who leans on Ti  Also INTP  w  is a really weird combination if you ask me ,intp
At the beginning it was hard to spot his ti but Jesus Christ his ti is insane the way he uses it so casually makes it come off as te tbh,intp
 B  ch lasagna  b  ch lasagna  This quote makes me so proud to be an INTP ,intp
INTP is so apparent is hard for me to see why would you vote ISTP lmao He clearly heavily relies on building ideas overtime  like most Fi users take time away to understand their own values and check on them  but Felix is more the type to fact check things  He clearly shows this whenever a discussion is brought up  he isn t into overthinking things but rather compiling information and building an opinion valid just as much as the information shows him  I know INTP have their own takes on things and that s not what I m talking about  Also I see some people saying he s INTP because he ponders about philosophical questions  which makes zero sense  I m ISFP and I ve read tons of philosophy  in fact is my favorite kind of text ,intp
https   youtu be oMzLaEWRoc  so what do you guys think ,intp
Someone reading this needs to ask him to do the Sakinorva test  These comments are becoming a mess ,intp
I have not seen one INTP argument and alot of people or bots voted that ,intp
Honestly the ISFJ arguments provided are quite good  I could definitely see his Ti but I couldn t see his Ne even a bit and saw his Si more which got me wondering if he was an Si dom  And there were only two Si Doms  ISTJ and ISFJ  For a newbie and an idiot like me  the most biggest example of his Si was the way he used the same kick for literal years  His Fe was quite visible too with the care he showed for his friends  even for his friends friend  in pah s case   if he wanted he could ve easily dropped that  it wasn t something that should ve concerned him  Another example of his Si was the fact that he picked takemicci solely because he reminded him of his brother  Sure  it can be his love for his brother  but he literally saved him and trusted his life upon him was something that seemed Si to me  Idk tho  I m an idiot so maybe I m using functions wrongly ,intp
I think that talking about the current Mikey is highly unnecesary   We ve seen in all the previous chapters that his main goal is to bring back the people that he lost  even if that means renouncing to his own individualism  He did that when he literally copied the path of Shinichiro   Now that he has lost Izana  Mikey adopted his dream of creating the largest crime sindicate in Japan as a way to bring him back  Sano is a person fiercely stucked in the past  that has no sense of himself  His dark impulses are only a manifestation of his trauma  and the reason why he looks like an INTJ is because he is copying Izana  Everything that he makes now is not the true Mikey  but him acting as another person ,intp
I really don t get why INTP voters keep using the Ti Si loop argument  when us ISFJ voters can also make the same argument with the Si Ti loop  Either way its a flawed argument without any solid examples  If there s any then feel free to educate me since I m pretty new to the concept  but from what I can see its pretty much impossible to look at a scene and say  This is proof that the character is in a loop ,intp
I can t see his Ti as dom but his Si is obviously showing think about the scene when Mikey found the name   Tokyo manji   for the gang he is not good at creating new ideas and being theoretical  He is sensing the events  memories and his past in his mind very deeply  He can visualize those moments in his mind as if he is reliving them  so he is sensitive mentally and he cannot make logical choices  He is kind of obsessed with the past and can never get over his regrets  That s why he is an ISFJ more than INTP guys   My advice is that you should read all the chapters and type him after that  ,intp
Here are my aux Ne arguments because to me aux Fe doesn t make sense  Ti is an extremely subjective function  When they persuade something they often discard external world  obligation and relationships  Ne helps with pointing out the external world to Ti  That s what you mistake for Fe  He s not the people pleaser you describe him to be  He does take other opinion into consideration  external sources  possibilities  but always values what is logic to him  So basically him listening to others advice is not because of Fe  but because he is trying to come up with possible solutions based on external resources  You seem to forget that the aux function is there to support dom function ,intp
I saw a good INTP walltext so I m going to rebate it cutting some parts to make it easier to read  nothing against the user who wrote it  I m only using this to explain    In the scene where Mikey and Takemitchi were on the hospital roof  Mikey was shown to have noticed early on that Takemitchi some how knew more than he should have  displaying his perceptive  analytical nature   This is surely Ti  but not nearly in a dominant way  A TiDom would have inquired much more in the strange atittudes of Takemichi  but Mikey never mentioned again that topic  The unique character who displayed some sort of intuition to deduce that Takemichi was a time traveler was Akkun  Mikey noticed something strange  but he doesn t bothered himself with questions and instantly dropped the topic      If you closely pay attention to the way Mikey behaves during Toman s meetings  you ll see how he carefully considers everything that he s presented with before making a decision  Whenever he was interrupted by people  he wouldn t get offended and try to immediately regain control  instead he d stay calm and quiet to observe and analyze what new information he s being presented with before carrying on    This never happened and it s false  Only take a look at the Moebius arc  when Takemichi warned him that Moebius members were more perilous than he imagined  Mikey refused to hear Takemichi and says that once he decides to do something  he ll continue with his desition until the end  displaying some sort of tunel vision  Ne inf   Mikey doesn t want to incorporate new information to his framework  he wants to do things in his own way        Sauntering into a classroom disregarding the fact that it s full of students and a teacher  only because you want to talk to someone is something I highly doubt an Si dom would do  irrespective of how unhealthy they may be    This means actually nothing  It s not strange for a teenager to act like he is the king of the world  and Si     show respect in situations that are indifferent to you  Mikey was not a student in that school  so he acted like he wanted and that doesn t mean anything      When he was healthier i e  pre time skip  he could easily change plans when presented with new data  Takemitchi s hatred for Kisaki wasn t brushed under the rug by Mikey  he instead proposed a negotiation and immediately accepted his request to kick him out of Toman  even though he had full plans in place to make Kisaki a powerful leader within the gang  Mikey was also constantly looking into the future to help Toman grow    Mikey s negotiation with Takemichi is a display of Si Fe  He previously knew that Kisaki was dangerous  and simpathysed with the hatred of Takemichi EVEN when he didn t gave reasons  A TiDom would have seek for a logical explanation to his hate and should acted basing himself on the new data   And Mikey never wanted actively to make ToMan grow  He simply gained battles and things came to him  but he hadn t an active paper in that  only when he was influenced by Kisaki  Fe     That doesn t mean his Ne is inferior though  as if that were the case  I don t think he d be so insistent on making a new age of delinquents  He wants things to be new  and he wants to be the one to implement them  Yes  you could say he s trying to go back to the way his brother ran things therefore he s an Si dom or whatever  but I think that nostalgic desire to return to the way things once were is just another example of Si tert     This has been refuted and adressed a hundred times  so I don t know the point of keep using this as an argument  Mikey doesn t want to create something new  but to implement something that worked in the past  Why a desire purely based on Si would be a proof of a tertiary position      he refused to show any wavering in his usually calm demeanour when Draken was in hospital  but was then seen sobbing alone outside when the operation was a success  Do I need to explain further  His blatant inability to show his emotions in front of other people is a huge indicator of inferior Fe   This is having a poor understanding of what being a Fe user means  Mikey acted as the ToMan leader  so he showed a strong and confident personality to don t bother his subordinates during a complicated situation  Fe is not circumscribed to emotional show up  but to understand the tribe s feelings and acting to influence in them ,intp
I ve seen some people argue that he s an unhealthy INTP  Even if you try to type dark impulses Mikey  he d still fit the ISFJ category  unhealthy ISFJs become too focused on the past  you really can t deny that Mikey isn t  because legit the reason why be pulled the lone wolf crap and started Bonten was because he was holding on gang life for dear life   They also pull the protagonist self sacrificing bs  Mikey believed that the best way to guarantee a good future for everyone was by disbanding Toman  even if he himself didn t want to  he also cut everyone off believing that everyone will have a better future without him  I could go on and on forever  most of the TR typing is horrendous  but Mikey s page wins ,intp
enneagram   s sin is avarice   s are extremely stingy and create attachments to certain things depending on their subtype  In the social  s case  that attachment is related to knowledge and ideals  This   subtype tends to be seen as elitist  they have a disregard for the ordinary  look for higher ideals and like to surround themselves with knowledgeable experts they view as interesting   This subtype is so called the  professor  for a reason   s feel afraid of being too overwhelmed by the world around them  and the so   s way of dealing with this fear is by becoming an expert in a certain area to guide them through life  This tendency of his is especially evident in the chapter where we get to see Yosano s backstory  Ranpo clearly considers himself to be the pillar of the agency and sees his intelligence as his support through life  not a place he sees as secure like it would for an sp subtype   The name given to this subtype is  Totem   which communicates their need for  super ideals   or the need to relate to people who share their intellectual values  interests  and ideals  The image of a totem suggest both height and a character that is constructed  like an object  rather than a human being  These Fives do not relate to regular people in everyday life  they relate to easily idealized experts who share their ideals  to people who display what they see as outstanding  Ranpo isn t interested in people he deems as ordinary  when he meets Poe in season    he seems completely uninterested in communicating with him and sees it as  unworthy of his time   until he saw Poe s ability as mentally challenging and an opportunity to apply his knowledge  This   also has a disregard for the ordinary in general  their minds r incredibly rich so they expect the outside world to be so as well  In Ranpo s dislikes  we can see that he hates  useless knowledge  and  common sense   those  s r completely uninterested in mundane reality and will often ignore  basic  common knowledge such as taking a train as they deem it to be completely useless  They r quite elitist and can often come off as arrogant beacuse of this sense of ignorance towards daily life tasks  I ve seen some comments stating that Ranpo has a   fix because he likes praise  but this can also be explained by his social instinct  Social  s love being praised by how knowledgeable they are as it feeds their ego desire for competence ,intp
its been really long since i read the manga and there are probably lots of things that i dont know back then but i do think that his ni usage is not really bad  when he uses his ability  its not an ability tho  the dots in his mind connect to each other and he comes to a conclusion  he is actually a kind of  i already know  person   at first i thought  what if he is an ISTP  but he is definitely not se aux  not even close to it  but his function usage is pretty close to something like this  ti ne si ni fe   ,intp
He s absolutely an INTP in my book  but I m curious as to where his Fe inf shows since I ve been trying to look into that more  Thoughts ,intp
Why social five       social vs self persvartion five  The SO Five searches for the essence or meaning of situations  with a focus on the big questions as they pursue wisdom and knowledge  They connect with groups or experts who share their brilliance and high ideals  often disconnected from everyday issues or emotions  While sharing values and ideals with energy and enthusiasm  they may resist sharing space  time or inner resources  disconnecting from the people around them   SP five    Very protective of personal space and privacy  this type sets clear limits and boundaries and is very comfortable living a relatively solitary life with just a few close friends  They would much rather observe social life than participate in it  Often truly introverted  they prefer not to reveal much of their inner self  finding it difficult to lower their guard for fear of losing their privacy or sense of safety        Ranpo is clearly a so five  probably so sp  due to his deisre for stability    He wants and needs validation and recognition for his great talent  He likes challenges and gets bored easily  Loves to prove how brilliant his mind is and impress others  MANGA SPOILER He feels responsible for safety of his coworkers and whole agency ,intp
we have some new commenters saying he s a social   but no one is giving an argument why pls don t just say  there s NO way he s an sp    pls explain  ,intp
i kinda understand ENTP votes but i think it s clear he uses ti ne  i would love examples of why he s a ne dom tho cause i m kinda on the fence,intp
His ti   ne are so strong   enough for an INTP  ,intp
sincere question for that one ENFJ voter  wtf,intp
i haven t read the manga and it s been a while since i watched the anime  but from what i remember there s no way that he s an sp  ,intp
                                                                                    ,intp
i really think  upon further inspection  Albedo is a social    a common misconception about being a social type is it automatically makes you more extroverted  social  s can actually come across the coldest  they understand the social environment more than sp  s  so they are much pickier in who they involve themselves with   that being said  Albedo is seen constantly looking for the supernatural ideals that social  s are known for   the truth of this world  what can it be   alchemy is the instrument he uses to try to find a mystical ideal in everyday life  also  he doesn t hoard knowledge like a typical self preservation   would  especially in the recent quest  he s involved in teaching people and sharing his findings  his voice lines also includes him asking traveller to assist him  he adopts the  professor  role of the social   almost perfectly ,intp
why is he typed as LVEF  I would ve thought LFVE  seeing how alchemy could be directly perceived as physics  I mean  it is very connected to the external environment and the effects of it  related to many senses and the inner workings of something  plus  he seems the type to be more concerned about his work capabilities and achieving his true potential  therefore the  V  besides   E makes way more sense   they re very accepting of any human emotion for the most part but don t prioritize it on their own  they arent always the most expressive people but that s purely because they dont see a need or reason to do so,intp
finally just got him to friendship    today in time for finishing his event     obvious INTP imo  i sorta see why people think he has Ni but i think he definitely is TiNe  that being said  i don t see much   in him so i m wondering if he s a   instead  he specifically talks about how he doesn t put much thought into his own identity and etc which wouldn t make much sense for someone with a   fix,intp
    spoilers            What do you guys type for the failed albedo experiment  I feel like he has high se ,intp
       spoilers     Just for fun  what type do you think Impostor Albedo is   We don t know much about him but we at least know a few things  like how what he wanted was the life Albedo had  being acknowledged as a real person  having friends  being called by a name of his own  etc   He was also very smart and quick to acquire knowledge that d help him  mimicking Albedo s notes as soon as he started his plan and gaining an understanding of alchemy very quickly just by reading some notes  his mimicry of Albedo himself though wasn t as good  and he decided to remove a noticeable birthmark just because he thought it was an  imperfection   which is why he was caught so quickly   I m thinking maybeeeeeeeeee ENTJ  though I m not sure  he only showed up for a bit and had his motivation explained by Albedo who may or may not be an accurate judge of character ,intp
I m still debating     vs      I think both could work since the differences are so minimal for so sp  w    Definitely a social   though  He still needs his alone time because that s just how  s are  but he doesn t have that avarice for knowledge like a self preserving   at average health might have  He wants to use his gifts to better the world and seems to enjoy sharing his knowledge  He might not see the value in the little nuanced bits of socializing that he deems unnecessary  but he tries anyway  and the most recent event really shows that he wants to connect with others but isn t always sure of himself since it doesn t come naturally to him  It s clear that he values the social sector a lot  it s just it wasn t as obvious before because we only had information about him being reclusive and seeing social interaction as a waste of time,intp
Depressing to see a kind and healthy INTP start to get mistyped as INFJ because of parts in their story where they d shown empathy or emotional intelligence and because they have developed Fe  Albedo isn t dismissive and conclusive enough to be an Ni user  Ni revolves around anticipation through what you observe and a series and chain if what s to come through that based on your inner perception  It s more spontaneous than Ti Ne  Albedo uses his Ti to logically make sense of what situations he s in and analyze what is happening in front of him through perspective and Ne to gather all of the possibilities of it  but he never specifically narrows down or dismisses those possibilities in the middle of coming to a conclusion  Instead what he does is keep in mind multiple ideas of the future based on his deduction and leaves it to simmer and keeps conscious awareness of it ,intp
hm  wondering about the   fix in his tritype rn  i m playing the new event and he says  nationality and identity are not what ultimately define us   obviously this isn t much to go on but  s are very identity based ,intp
Guys it s just his Ni base  ILI  that makes him seem Ni dom  Ni doms use current  Se  trends to see future overall patterns  On contrast  Albedo uses previously gathered knowledge  Si  to form possible outcomes  Ne  and test his theories and conceptualizations  Ti   His Ni base is what detaches him from  wordly affairs   This IM is known as the Time function  since it uses all gathered information to be able to see cause and effect relations and  through it  foresee outcomes ,intp
Those who voted ENTP cited his emphasis on imagination as an evidence of Ne  That is true  But he considered the significance of logical consistency and the first principles above everything else both in his research and in his popular explanations  Ne Doms are more skeptic than him and for him Ne is only something nurturing his Ti ,intp
I can say with      certainty that Albert Einstein is an INTP  He was on a long search for the truth of how the Universe worked and why things occurred the way that they did  I can also see Ne because of how Einstein created completely novel theories of how the universe worked based on patterns that he recognized about the Universe and observations he made over his lifetime  I can also see Inferior Fe being an option due to him cheating on his wife many times   Also one question about the consensus  Why is he a ILE and not a LII ,intp
I don t know man   he looks like an ENTP with devolved ti or an INTP with devolved ne  ,intp
Does anyone here actually understand relativity and  E mc   ,intp
Yeah I get the point he came off as a stereotypical INTP but  Imagination is more important than knowledge  for knowledge is limited  whereas imagination embraces the entire world  stimulating progress  giving birth to evolution   Ne  ti,intp
He is an ENTP  One day in the future it would be obvious that it was a huge mistype of einstein as INTP not ENTP although it is      vote for    now,intp
Einstein era um g nio burro  G nio pois seus trabalhos influenciaram o mundo moderno e a ci ncia  mas burro porque era machista e cuz o,intp
proud of being INTP like Einstein,intp
Okay  so let s see    until now we have several ENTP votes because he had charisma and humor  followed by INTJ  cause he was obiviously a   SMARTY ONE   and some trolls who had nothing better to do than typing him as ESFJ ,intp
near my beloved,intp
especially the artistic style  It seems crazy to me in all areas  it is all just as it has to be  incredibly adapted everything  although the manga is superior  the openings  endings  thematics  all very well achieved ,intp
I like death note  It s really dull and mysterious but also has its lighthearted moments  This      is about god  justice  and other deep concepts  And DON T EVER FORGET IT S FANDOM ,intp
death note is one of the best things ever created in existence ,intp
dropped it after episode    cuz it was getting boring without L and i felt a void in me came back   months later and finished it the second arc wasnt bad i just think near s personality was rushed thats why everyone hates him  you guys gotta read the manga,intp
I love this anime,intp
I hated light but he s such a good protagonist  Watching lights te ni vs L s ti ne in action was so interesting  I wish I could relive the experience of watching it for the first time   ,intp
Basically all iNtuitive Thinkers  Since its all about lofty ideas and critical thinking   And also INFPs since they adore these types  Definitely think this show appeals to anyone with   and   in their tritype and enneagram ,intp
At risk of feeding into intuitive bias   this show just appeals to us  Don t believe me  Look at the votes ,intp
one of the only animes i ve watched all the way through  i love it so so much lol,intp
my mom s and ESTJ choleric sanguine and dad s an ISTP choleric phlegmatic  the amount of arguments in my house creates this stress in me that is slowly killing me  ,intp
give me a break,intp
AS MUCH AS I HATE THEM ESFJ mom Se something dad,intp
ISTJ mother  ISFJ father  rocky relationship with them for a lot of my childhood  they tried  but it made me feel worse    Them thinking they understand me  when they just know me  I ve given up on trying to convince them that  Now we just accept our differences and try to work around it  They still think the N and P is just a phase ,intp
wow i never thought the most result fit me,intp
my whole family is basically sensors and it s great   making fun of the intuitive cousins  P not actually but we re very concrete and physical  we don t do cerebral or intellectual as much,intp
Probably ,intp
ISFJ mom and ISTJ dad   Ni me  ,intp
ESTJ mom   ISFJ dad  T T,intp
ESTJ mom and ESTP dad  INFJ me    hehehe  Sigh ,intp
Proof that     of the INTX s you stumble upon are not genuis gods,intp
How ISFP  Where is the fi  ,intp
couldn t find a more relatable INTP     ,intp
wtf patrick is literally ENFP like     ,intp
An INTP with  L makes absolutely no sense ,intp
I think it s funny how     of the comments bring up Patrick s intelligence  because last time I checked  intelligence wasn t a cognitive function  Patrick doesn t have any Fi  nor very apparent Fe  and his logic is more freeform instead of objectively applicable like a Te user s would be  Seeing how low his focus on Fe is  he is a Ti dom    Ne Si seems more apparent  with Patrick often tuning out of situations and coming back when he has something he wants to say  often being random tangents  differing from whatever conversation is being discussed ,intp
ISTP fits more instead of Ne    His own way of thinking and improvising things can label as hilariously idiotic  Ti Se loop    Calling him as idiotic because some Si doms  Fe Doms or even Te doms thinking in systematic and organized way  which Patrick lacks of ,intp
 We have technology   smashes computer   Socio Te PolR at its finest,intp
This says a lot about society,intp
Patrick is SEI   SLI  He s unproductive with his life by not having a job  void of common sense and doing the basic practical things right most of the time  and can t afford money for Krabby Patties  These traits are anti Te  perfectly matched with Te vulnerable  He also expresses his emotions far more than what you would expect from an Fe vulnerable type  He s a Merry type rather than a Serious one  which makes him Alpha   Delta   He also makes a lot humorous jokes and banter in the show  which is indeed Fe valuing  If Patrick is SLI and SpongeBob is ESE  that would make SpongeBob Patrick s supervisor according to the Socionics intertype relation theory  which would make no sense for how close they are  He also shows intellect by making some very wise statements  which I can associate with Ti HA mobilizing   He s obviously Si base though  Very laid back  lazy  calm  feels comfortable living inside his own rock doing nothing  enjoys getting involved in activities with his best friend SpongeBob such as jellyfishing and hide   seek  and he enjoys eating food comfortably when he gets to see any of it    I m not sure about him being INTP in MBTI when he s voted as a  F  confident physics  and a  L  unbothered logic  in AP though  That s just contradictory to me  I can t imagine any NT type having that kind of combination  Of course  Patrick can be an odd character  but if he were to be an INTP  he would have to have higher L placement and maybe lower F and E placement ,intp
All the INTPs I know smoke  I know a lot of them  Im confused,intp
cigarettes   no  yuck  nasty  weed on the other hand  I love it ,intp
I love the feeling of breathing fresh air  Especially the night air  which is different from the daytime air  Night air tends to be cooler and more humid  Breathing it in is like drinking fresh water   So I hate when people pollute that air with cigarettes  Especially when they do it at night  or when it s hot  preventing me from opening the window in my room  Not to mention the fact that cigarettes are not only annoying but are also harmful to both those who smoke and those who inhale the smoke around them against their will  Especially those who have asthma or breathing problems  or maybe even people who are trying to quit their addiction to cigarettes  In other words  it is not only self destructive  which is something that also worries me a lot  but it also affects others   Which worries me even more because it s not fair for innocent people to be affected by your decision to harm yourself    There are many reasons why I hate smoking  In fact I think I haven t even named them all,intp
I like my lungs   Had a death in my family due to smoking  I tried it  but will never touch it again ,intp
I don t really do these kind of stuff that would cause a worse consequence on the human body when you keep smoking and definitely I wouldn t recommended it to anyone who wants to try it and if you want to experience it there s consequence of smoking so be wary on it s effects  how it affects your health  etc    It s quite disrespectful even to me that there are people who literally smokes in the front of people which is why I use to question them on why they feel need to smoke around people ,intp
Must be fun to have goth lungs,intp
I do not,intp
Don t smoke but I do chew nicotine gum which helps my anhedonia a lot  It s not nearly as addictive as cigs btw and has less withdrawal symptoms than even caffeine ,intp
 OMG an ISTP that doesn t smokk        j no  I do not smoke lmao  I hope not in the future ,intp
i definitely have to disagree with this   i LOVE smoking ,intp
this man s functions gotta be Ti   Ti   Ti   Ti,intp
I think that L is a pretty good example of an unhealthy   with his extreme hiddenness  I ve been in between about him being w  or w  for a while  but the reason that he is so closed off and hidden from the world is very reminiscent of  w  over  w   I get that him being the best detective with a lot of enemies plays into it  but it s not just for formal reasons    he is severely distrusting of people  which is why the creator says L could never have a friend  L believes people to be dishonest and bad  and that if he becomes close with people he will be hurt  he hides himself away because he looked for something to trust and came up with nothing  leading to a strong fear about the world and other people  he only allows watari in  he s much more defensive  competitive and flexible than a  w    w s also do not have as severe distrust of others as  w s  and even when they do they don t really actively do much about it  he tests the other detectives not only once  but repeatedly even after they ve proved their loyalty  looking for who or what can be trusted is a staple in E   does he really do anything staple in E   most of the  w  arguments are about surface traits and stereotypes  but don t often mention something deeper  being abstract  an  out of the box guy  and weird does not make L w  ,intp
Can you explain his weird habits like eating only sweet food and sitting in an uncomfortable pose from the position of mbti socionics another typology ,intp
why sx   over so     i was thinking sp so but the consensus says otherwise ,intp
I don t know who said L is an extrovert but my question to them is  have you watched Death Note ,intp
L is an INTP  People who claim he has Ni because of his mastermind mind tricks and planning missed a point     L has absolutely no Fi in him at all  He isn t trying to catch Kira for the sake of justice and morality  something a detective with Fi would do  and does it because murder cases are his hobby    L is a Ti dom  Ti is about deductive logic and applying principles to already known ones  When Light killed the fake L on television  L was sure Kira lived in that neighbourhood because the show only broadcasted there    A Ni dom detective would ve suspected Light was Kira due to symbols  patterns  and if something went wrong with their plan   L suspected Light as Kira due to objective facts only    Inferior Fe   L never really picked up social cues about Kira  Light had a very fake innocent persona when around L in my opinion  and never used any social manipulation or pick up body clues   When Light was  studying  and writing down names on the death note while eating potato chips  the pacing while eating it was so off  but L didn t care and only came to conclusions about what he sees and knows    I see Light studying and eating  not killing  So he shouldn t be Kira  ,intp
se dom  he enjoys physical sensations like eating food  core   also because he likes eating food,intp
I remember there was this one user trying to convince everyone here that L is an INTJ and that Near is INTP ,intp
L is such an L bro   ratio   yagami better,intp
The creator of attitudinal psyche actually made a few TikTok videos on L being an FLEV        https   vm tiktok com ZM vvuPPp        https   vm tiktok com ZM vvt HA        https   vm tiktok com ZM vv  bF ,intp
Gosh dang it I have to write college essays and I am here ,intp

Once the sheltered INxP kid finally gets time on the school laptop  they can t stop ,intp
I could live without internet  but it is better to be on internet  ,intp
i m      addicted  ,intp
if I were a normal ISTP  with Se  I could be LIVING   actually i don t want it   i was mistyped  i am INTP,intp
damn this site is calling me out,intp
my screentime is getting rlyyy bad                 ,intp
I always get typed as INTJ or INTP lol  Where did that ni come from ,intp
Ni Ti loop makes me seem like an archetypal INTP  but INFJ makes more sense when I consider my life as a whole as opposed to just now  Also   w  enneagram with a   fix makes more sense than   core due to  again  how I ve behaved and such,intp
ISFP and ISTJ    DO I LOOK LIKE SQUIDWARD  ,intp
The most common type I got on tests either by letters or cognition  are INFP and INTJ  and auditionally also got tested as ENTJ ESTJ ISTJ   ect sometimes depends on the test,intp
i had a hard time trying to figure out if i were enneagram  w  or  w   i now am pretty sure i am  w  but still a lot of tests type me as  ,intp
The bad thing is that each friend would say I m a different type  One would say I m ENTP  another would say I m ENFJ  another would say I m XSTP  another would say I m ISFP and another would say I m EXFP,intp
 I think therefore I Ti      personalities      ,intp
  p please my se is non existent,intp
P sure I got mistyped as an ESFP at some point,intp
  personalities keeps on typing me as INTP t ,intp
I feel so bad for enjoying it    I wish I could be a normal fe dom  ,intp
This is very entertaining i shouldn t laugh at some of these but hey I m a terrible person,intp
Yeah  what a   thing  The  if you like animals  poll consensus is    with many   people  Makes literally no sense ,intp
this comment section is so stupid yet so entertaining and there are lots of jokes here that made me chuckle,intp
I like dark humor because the candy cart was also   ,intp
I,intp
 Why did your father die    His finger got hit by a hammer    But that can t kill him  can it    He didn t stop screaming so I shot him     A   You know our friend  Diana  I   B  interrupted    know  she tested positive for C       last week   A    hugged her yesterday  ,intp
What do you call a child at a shooting range   Extra points ,intp
Dark humor reveals dark and unironic truths  I love it,intp
YES    Especially Isaac Butterfield ,intp
I think it s a waste of time  Try to like convince the person why they are wrong  If they still are maniacs ignore them ,intp
A tool that could have had its place  had it not proven to be the weapon of choice for a loud minority of people too immature and dogmatic to use it,intp
It s a cancer on humanity,intp
Cancel culture is pure Fi  INFP and ENFP the most  cancellers  ,intp
Yay INFP votes goes brr,intp
Cancel culture is now nothing more than sadistic psychopaths who enjoy literally destroying people s reputations just to feel powerful online  I could see the point of it at first but as usual with the left  the methods are just awful and end up attracting the worst people  At this point it s just an out of control  bloodthirsty mob who feels they have the right to bully people for whatever things they said or did that they didn t like  Anyone sane of mind should be against it ,intp
i m a mcyt fan  i m legally required to hate cancel culture  i have watched one of my favorite ccs and a creator of the mc championship get attacked on twitter for    making a pride event as a gay person    putting the dteam on the same team for a non canon event    probably something else    and this has caused trauma for him and restrained his creative decisions  tl dr  cancel culture is stupid and people who  cancel  other people usually dont bother to look up what theyre talking about,intp
     cancel culture,intp
I think holding people accountable for their actions is something we definitely need to do  but the thing i don t like about  cancel culture  is that people seem to forget that we  as humans  can and will in fact change  we grow and learn  i hate people canceling others for some shi t they said   years ago  none of us is the same person that we were back then  and all of us said stuff that now we regret  because we were able to learn and grow to try to become a better person  It s ok to hold people accountable for their actions but accept that sometimes we re just ignorant to a lot of things  be open to forgive and listen  but sadly al lot of what these people want to do is create drama and don t even care about the ones who may have been affected by someone s actions  No one wins here ,intp
Just like an user below said  people who whine about cancel culture just want people to not be held accountable for their actions  If you say or do some offensive disgusting      I know I m going to rightfully drag your behind and take my support and my coins somewhere else  No one should feel entitled to other s people support and money  Also  your beloved  free apeech  is not a one way street thing    Bu bu but you should not cancel them  you should educate them   Why would you put that burden on othe affected people  The Internet has an infinite ammount of information about almost anything  Do your own research if you care so much  DW if you want  I said what I said  ,intp
What is the point of this ,intp
I can be INTJ to strangers  ENTP in arguement and ENFP to friends and family ,intp
Any INTP fellow that has been mistyped just for being super expressive when talking  I think that I developed some kind of ENFP persona and that s the first impression I give,intp
Wtf who voted for ESFJ and ENTP,intp
Typing my youngest sister  You know she s INTP when she s only    and she s the smartest person in our whole family haha,intp
How can u tell difference between  w  and  w  ,intp
Hello fellow INTPs  Hope you ll all have a wonderful christmas ,intp
Obviously ESFJ    j,intp

Chisato Shirasagi is best girl  you re wrong if you disagree ,intp
PasuPare and Morfonica let s go,intp
RAS and pasupare fans gather around,intp
My friend loves it so I voted his type,intp
I need someone to clarify agreeable  im not fully convinced  he has a tendency to be blind to the needs of others  he isn t exactly that selfish but he isn t self   sacrificing or sensitive too easily  he is cooperative  but not always when it isn t in his interest  he does not show kindness and affection outwardly   he is a little egocentric  but not by a huge margin imo ,intp
Type   people who care a lot about trust can be very helpful and altruistic towards the person they are very close to and attached to  moreover  they cannot easily give up on someone they are attached to  So was Dipper  he couldn t give up on the girl he liked  moreover  he had given up his Uncle s education for his sister Mabel   w  are more observant and introverted ,intp
I love him sm ok  but WHY HIS NAME IS MASON HELP,intp
hes just like me fr  but with ne    I was kinassigned him in middle school and I was    because i wanted to be Mabel but holy      we are literally the same person it isn t funny,intp
Why ennea        Can someone brief me on it ,intp
HIS FIRST NAME IS MASON   ,intp
May I ask why  w   Obviously  if he were to be a    he d be sexual   blind  but definitely not self preservation    he s not super warm to people in order to attract someone to protect him  I don t see social    either  He doesn t have such a focus on duty  an ideology  or authorities  Wouldn t social   make the most sense    These Fives do not relate to regular people in everyday life  they relate to easily idealized experts who share their ideals  to people who display what they see as outstanding characteristics based on shared values and knowledge and who they can keep at a certain distance  One Social Five I know says he  collects people  who share his interests and values    Dipper loved to admire those who he found shared his interest in intellectual pursuits such as Ford     They look for meaning to avoid a fearful sense that the world is meaningless  but in their search for meaning they orient themselves so much toward finding the quintessence of life  the extraordinary  that they may become disinterested in everyday life    Dipper s character seemed to revolve around curiosity and wonder with the  extraordinary  aspect of Gravity Falls  rather than the boring  normal  city    Can anyone explain sp  or social     social    And why  V  He didn t seem as though he was the  inspiring  type but rather the more ambitious  intellectually driven one ,intp
S E   Talking about calling Wendy for a dance  Mabel  Don t you think you should just talk to Wendy like a normal person   Dipper   shows list of steps  That s step    little sis ,intp
What are your guys  thoughts on emotions possibly tackling on subjects such as social interactions  reading people ect     Because I feel insecure emotions would fit really well with dipper in that circumstance ,intp
good day to be an INTP virgo   ,intp
I believe most of the votes for sp so only took into account the instinct theory and not how it relates to the tritype  so I ll summarize why I think he s a so  sp  and sx  and how        so why I believe it to be is     so sp   Firstly  the social   are very similar to Si users  they both are extremely attached to an ideal thing person and faithfully follow that  This starts to be seen in Kakashi when he sees his father kill himself purely for breaking the rules  after that he becomes completely opposed the idea of abandoning missions and breaking rules  and starts to use the idea that  in the ninja world whoever breaks the rules is scum  as a coping mechanism  Also  many people see Kakashi as an ISTJ for being so strict and bound to rules  but his way of thinking is extremely Ti based  he obviously uses a lot of his Si not only for being INTP but also for being so   as he attributed this philosophy of life not because it was extremely valuable and morally correct for him  but because the conclusion that breaking the rules   inadmissible was the most logical response he could find in response to the huge trauma he had been through  He s in a visible TiSi loop  where INTP s become closed off to new possibilities and stick to their past  overthinking it to find answers to things that happened over and over  it may sound like ISTJ s in SiFi loop since they also stick to their past almost in a obsessive way but the difference is  Kakashi is extremely detached from his feelings and personal biases  while the SiFi is known to mistake their usual logic and practical thoughts with their own feelings  According to Beatrice Chestnut  the Social     Duty   find safety by relying on authorities  or on the  authority of reason  rules  and rational thinking        Consciously or unconsciously  Social Sixes fear the disapproval of authorities and believe the way to be safe is to do the right thing as determined by an authority  And knowing what the right thing is means having clear rules that tell you how you should think and act   It s extremely characteristic of Kakashi s sense of duty and the way he relies on always completing missions no matter what  because he s afraid of being in a suitable position of criticism just like his father was  It is noteworthy that archetypally  the guidelines of whatever system a Social   follows become a kind of replacement authority for the first authority the parent  usually the father  While they may have rebelled against or been disappointed by their actual father  they look for a good authority in life as a way of finding security  Total submission and obedience to authority  and the rules associated with authority  helps them feel safe in the world  When he has to decide whether or not to save Rin on the Kannabi Bridge mission  Obito tells him that  In the ninja world  those who break the rules and laws are seen as scum  but those who abandon even one of your friends are worse than scum   With that  he finds himself a new philosophy to live by and stuck to it ever since  He s so attached to that phrase that he repeats it several times throughout the anime  as he feels guilty for not understanding it before Obito  dies   Kakashi remains faithful to this way of thinking because he doesn t want to lose anymore friends  since they represent security and safeness for him and   fear losing exactly that  formerly  he used to feel secure by following his village s opinions  he couldn t get hurt if he did what was told   If the obito hadn t said that and hadn t  died  because of his  fault  there  he probably would have spent the rest of his life as he was  Thus  this new ideal that Obito gave him is what he keeps him safe and ensure no one dies  replacing the old one of following strictly the rules  This expresses itself not only in the way he vocalizes his principles  but also in how he developed habits similar to Obito s  such as always being late  something that when he was fixated on following rules he always reprehended   Social Sixes can tend to be controlling  impatient  judgmental  and self critical  They demand a lot of themselves  and may insist on everything being done according to their codes and viewpoints  Others may perceive Social Sixes as cold or cool  as they can be very formal in the things they do   All of his fights with Obito are a perfect example of how clear this is in Kakashi   Lastly  so    sp  bc  The Social Six is a stronger character that the Self Preservation Six  and this greater strength has to do with having more certainty than uncertainty  The Self Preservation Six is an insecure person they hesitate because they are not sure  The Social Six is someone who  in defense against the insecurity associated with not being sure  becomes too sure     continues in the comments ,intp
 Lacking either trust in themselves  like the Sexual Six  or other people  like the Self Preservation Six   Social Sixes deal with the passion of fear and its related anxiety by relying on abstract reason or a specific ideology   Yeah  I m thinking Social  ,intp
Of the best Naruto characters  I would have liked to see that the feud he had with Kabuto develop  it would be something incredible   De los mejores personajes de Naruto  Me abr a encantado ver que se desarrolle el feudo que tenia con Kabuto seguro seria algo increible ,intp

can someone explain why he s mel phleg  phleg mel suits him a lot better imo  open for discussion ,intp

 Real progress is a very recent phenomenon  Religion generally keeps its foot on the brake     Atheism is a way of clearing the space for better conversations    Both from Sam Harris  I forget which talk ,intp
Let s say I rank a   in the Dawkins scale ,intp
I am not voting because I am INTJ it just feels right for atheism to me thinker and judger  intuition suits fine and well most of religions are introvert  idk why ,intp
Religion just isn t popular in any Scandinavian or northern country really,intp
religion was made a longgg time ago to give meaning   answers to people back when we didn t have them  now we have science  and a lot of answers  however some people still hold on to their religion because it s the only thing keeping them going  ill never believe in god until someone proves me wrong     ,intp
For me  I see it as pointless to ponder or praise the existence of a being that isn t here now  I totally respect religion but for me  I m more pragmatic and prefer to focus on what I can do know now ,intp
I wish I could truly believe in something tbh,intp
No more Brahm s   Wikipedia  In Buddhism  the term anatt   Pali  or an tman  Sanskrit  refers to the doctrine of  non self    that no unchanging  permanent self or essence can be found in any phenomenon  While often interpreted as a doctrine denying the existence of a self  anatman is more accurately described as a strategy to attain non attachment by recognizing anything as impermanent  while staying silent on the ultimate existence of an unchanging essence  In contrast  Hinduism asserts the existence of Atman as pure consciousness or witness consciousness   reify ing  consciousness as an eternal self  ,intp
atheism is defintely TE FI come on people  INTP is more Jewish if anything   I m not a Jew but Judaism seems definitely INTP ,intp
Have a look at the whole astrolabe  and you may change your mind of astrology  Never look at the position of a single star ,intp
I m an aries  Supposedly I m a very outgoing  ambitious extrovert with great organizational skills  Ridiculous ,intp
it just doesn t make any sense,intp
Voting my own type  because astrology is dumb And also because I hate my zodiac sign,intp
Wow    MBTI has a whole study about the functions which can be taken into account more than astrology where it seems to be all about constellations and the date you are born I will research more about Wow    MBTI has a whole study about the functions which can be taken into account more than astrology where it seems to be all about constellations and the date you are born I will research more about to not be talking without knowing,intp
I ve talked about this on another profile   I don t believe in astrology  I don t like when people do something similar like   oops  Sorry  I am a Vertigo haha I can t be friends with you xD  WHY in the WORLD would you blame someone s astrology  holy        If you like or believe astrology  I don t mind that at all  Believe what you want because it s your choice  Just PLEASE don t be like those people I mentioned before ,intp
Do I believe in astrology  Absolutely not  Not even one bit      Will I still waste hours online reading what the stars have in store for me and blame my bad week on the fact that  mercury is in retrograde   You betcha     ,intp
is it fun to hate fun,intp
I don t mind it  is extremely funny to be able to call my friends toxic based on memes about astrology while being totally aware of how is all bullsh t  plus I literally like the MBTI which is also fake   the latter one is a little bit more coherent  tho   As long as you don t take them too seriously pseudosciences can be pretty fun ,intp
Anyone else hate that everyone thinks MBTI is a  pseudoscience  just like astrology  MBTI actually has reasons  but Astrology is just a bunch of when were you born nonsense  Your time of birth doesn t influence your personality or future  It is      illogical   ,intp
what the f is happening here,intp
sp       i m convinced you guys are just voting sp on introverts  ,intp
Killua and Machi have exactly the same tritype ,intp
It s so easy to see that Killua is all the time abstracting multiple possible scenarios and interpretations of a given situation     When I read ISTP arguments  I see nothing but a gross misunderstanding between Se and physical talents  Crazy voters claiming Killua is ISTP because he s athletic and has quick reflexes  wtf    ,intp
This one s not really debatable  He s INTP ,intp
can someone give an explanation for  w   i personally think he s a  w  but i feel like w  could be right from what i remember,intp
Why is Killua  w  and not  w    Type   wants to maintain freedom and happiness to avoid and discharge pain   Is it not the reason why Killua make friends with Gon so easily and the reason why Killua wanted to travel with him  Because he wanted to be happy  Killua saw Gon as a pure chiid  so different from his family  Gon was the chance to get away from pain  I can see why you voted  w   but Killua is more motivated by   ,intp
ILI and LII make no sense for Killua at all   D Ni for ILI doesn t work  nor is he Se PoLR in LII  lol  ,intp
So I see people talking about both Killua s socionics a lot more often and his IV s and or enneagram subtypes  Which honestly  good  it is cool to talk about other stuff   Anyways  for socionics  I have seen arguments for ILE  LIE  and ILI  I have seen SLI brought up too  but not that many arguments  at least in comparison to the other   I have mentioned   so with that said  does anyone have an argument they can give for what Killua s sociotype is  esp  since there seems to be such a variety of debated types in the comments  though ILE is winning by a huge margin in the votes  Though ILI has a reasonable amount of votes  Still not really close to ILE though   so I would love to see some arguments on Killua s sociotype and what it is  Preferably a more detailed and or in depth one if possible  You can also argue sociotype subtypes  I have seen both ILE Ti subtypes  both hard and not hard ti subtype  and LIE Ni subtype argued for  so if anyone has arguments involving subtypes too  I am all eyes to read it   Now Onto IV s and enneagram subtypes  Ok  first of all  and I have already brought this up  but for the people who think Killua being a Sp  is weird  they have to understand  that not all systems use subtypes  and so some people may just be typing IV s and enneagrams separately  Killua being a Sp Sx doesn t necessarily  at least to a good portion of people voting him that  mean they are voting him as Sp  subtype  Ok  There are different enneagram and IV s  I think at least  on the latter that is  systems out there after all   And even without taking that into account  Imo  even if you are using a system using subtypes  you should still think if someone fits an IV and esp  core enneagram type  you shouldn t base your argument around subtypes  if they don t fit the core enneagram  I have seen this way too often on this site    Moving on  since both his IV s and enneagrams are being brought up again  If people want  like Killua s sociotype they could give arguments on what enneagram and IV s they think Killua has  either using the subtype system or not  I want to be fair   If you are using the subtype system  please explain how you think Killua fits that subtype and or that subtype more than another  if possible  keep what I said about fitting IV s and or esp  the core enneagram enneagram as well  Someone shouldn t JUST fit the subtype  and not the other parts of the enneagram as well    I personally think Killua shows both Sp  and Sx  subtype signs  and that he probably is a Sp Sx in the the system s  where subtypes aren t as much a factor  but that is just me  Feel free to tell me what you guys think and think  please try to be polite and nice though everyone  ,intp
Sorry guys  but definitely Killua isn t Alpha Quadra  I see TeNi valorization more than NeTi  Remember again that the LIE is very confused with ILE  Now  I am confused if He is an INTP or ENTP  I will go with LIE this time  because I don t see Fe PoLR ,intp
The whole INTP delusion is more likely because of his enneagram  made him divert from the typical ENTJ   like seriously where do you see his Ti or Ne   all what I got from his interviews is just a plain Te  ,intp
Seems like a pretty clear INTJ to me  Convergent Ni Fi is shown with his ongoing philanthropy  which he is very strategic about  in that he achieves not only present results  e g  a few children are fed   but future results as well  e g  most countries in Africa now do not and will have polio infections     Furthermore  his quote   I choose a lazy person to do a hard job  Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it   screams Te  He clearly cares about efficiency and supports the idea of cutting corners  Ti  on the other hand  is much more concerned with accuracy and prefers careful approaches to problems   For everyone saying that he is ENTJ or INTP  I fail to see the Se or Si ,intp
Where is his Ne   INTP votes are stereotyped since technology has been identified with Ti  Moreover  Ne is the most obvious function you would notice while observing an INTP  we have a hard time here to identify if he has Ne or not  which automatically demonstrates he has none  Te Ni fits him perfectly and I will provide arguments if anyone asks me to but it seems unnecessary since ENTJ voters have already provided great ones  The last but not least  INFERIOR FE   HOW  ,intp
Paul Allen on Bill  https   youtu be  IM SvIiMI  Fe user huh   A simple way to see his Demon Fe is to see this interview with Ellen  https   youtu be f NJQiY AuY He is famous as  Bill the Ruthless  in Microsoft   I have not seen any argument for Ne aux yet ,intp

voting ENTJ because i have the chance to tie it and i love chaos,intp

Every time I enter this page his personality changes lmao,intp

ILI   LIE  Relevant explanation here  https   www reddit com r Socionics comments oq o q comment h c orq  utm source share utm medium web x context    Gates does seem like an obvious D subtype though  which explains why he seems to be an LIE  Seems highly ordered for an ILI so I would go so far as to say DN subtype is most likely ,intp
people arguing over him being INTP and INTJ is literally me at   am trying to figure out whether i am INTP or INTJ  ,intp
this place is extremely chaotic,intp
I believe that a good amount of people doesn t know remember that all of the   cognitive functions coexist in the same person  it s just that usually in a completely healthy person only the first   tend to be used  For example regarding the Fe Fi arguement  i guess that somebody believes he has Fi based on the fact that he still wanted to die at the end of season   disregarding how his decision will affect others who are around him  which is in fact something somebody who has Fi as one of his functions would do  but you can clearly see that he is not in an healthy state  and as the  th function is described as the demonic  the function you use when you are the most destructive  I believe that Fi is his  th function  making Fe his  th  Somebody might argue that his idea to save only a few of children isn t something an Fe would think  but you have to consider that he values the most what consequences will his action have on norman and Emma  and not on the entire group ,intp
Been a while since ive been here but I still believe he is an INTP  Why  One thing I notice about Ray is his need to make sure that external thought processes are edited for more accurate judgements  and he is quite responsive to the logic or illogical nature of external thought processes  I also made a point earlier this year as to how his comparison of tag to a game of chess is Ne Si and not Se Ni  An Se Ni user explains concepts by the contents of the concept qnd the reasoning for sensory stimuli occuring in the conceptual framework  while Ne Si percieves a concept and mis reminded of other sense based concepts  perceiving likeness across seemingly different concepts  By all means Ray is an objective perciever  and it is one of his weaknesses  He sees too many possibilities  a way he could escape and also a way in which he cant  his objectivity causes him stress because sometimes even when something could work it also couldnt work  Something different could happen different from another possibility  He sees all these likelihoods and cant pick one confidently  so he doesnt act  If he were Se Ni or Ni Se  he would have more focused perception  but his perception is spread throughout a multitude of likelihoods which stop him from making choices because of the chaotic unpredictability of reality ,intp
This comment section is so hot      ,intp
he s literally in a Ti Si loop in the first season  WHY people keep voting in INTJ   ,intp
sorry for INTP voters  Ni and Fi of him are very apparent for me at least in anime  season     ,intp
How the      could he be INTP imao,intp
i dont know what to say to those who voted INTP     ,intp
i cant see the ti however i can see ne but i see him as an INTJ mainly i dont see his function s as INTP s functions honestly,intp
I m sorry  INFP is perhaps the WEEBEST personality of all  INFP is definitely the most suitable one for this category LMAO,intp
Genuinely have not met an INTP who dislikes anime    Hello  ,intp
I m not a weeb but I like lots of things from Japan  writers  traditional art  etc   and anime are one of them  There are lots of lousy anime  but lots of very good too and some anime marked me forever more than some movies   series ,intp
Anime fills in the empty void inside of me ,intp
I m an INTJ  maybe not  i made a comment on the  you  personality type  you can check it out  and I enjoy anime ,intp

Reflecting on my previous post  Yea it was couldve been more thorough  Let me clarify some things for the INTJ mistype to the ISTP conclusion    For the ISTP conclusion I pay attention to Sherlocks problem solving process  Sherlock is primarily an observer  He cannot help but to look at things  take in his environment and then judge what he is looking at in correlation to a system of behavior that surround one immediate event  His problem solving method is archetypal of ISTP cognitive functions  to precisely observe and efficiently conclude a sequence of actions that surround the logic of an event  Since Ni is relaxation for them  their deciding method is considerate of an insightful element  but the Ni aimed towards existential questions to define purpose in correlation to an introverted judgement is not their dominant way of doing things  it is used to help them understand the cause and effect around what their Se has fiercely taken in  This is Sherlock s problem solving method  As they are sensors this is the information they rely on before intuition  Take in the details and see which sensory variable are the most impactful and significant  then perceive the cause of how this happened and the effect for the immediate implications  Watch the pink suitcase detective scene  watch the scene where the Buckingham Palace guards come to his door  watch his natural quips when Molly walks into their presence about things she is wearing  The Se is unmistakable in him    For the INTJ mistype I misinterpreted how Ni users decide on the basis of their Ni  Rather than taking in the world and and generating cause and effectual insights through observation  they ask why  and then look at the world  and build a blueprint in their head based on the purpose of particular contents of external things  For INFJs  the external things are external thought processes  for INTJs the external things are personally metrics and their supposed value  At Sherlocks age his abstract image of himself would be more well defined in alignment to a purpose in relation to values  Instead  he is hyper indulgent in perceiving new stimuli and using Ni to solve it  Instead he cares about learning how to do things than he cares about aligning his behavior around a valued metric of purpose  His growth is not in seeing the world as it is  but rather  it is in being less stubborn about what is important in life  and listening to others ,intp
Personally  I typed this version of Sherlock initially as an INTJ  The Ni is incredibly strong  He will observe something and then gain a fluid insight as to how somethig got there with only a glimpse of fiercly observed sensory data  I also believed he was Te because of how he organized his thoughts   This happened then this happened then this happened then this happened  which  to me  came off as if he was simply using external metrics to define what his Ni was percieving  His insights also happen to be incredibly long  and its almost as if he lives in this insightful world  He asks the wuestion  why  alot as well  always wanting to know the purpose behimd sensory phenomena  guaging thr cause of present phenomena anf rhe effect of that phenomena for the future  He is also very task oriented  interested in the metrics of behavior that are necessary to get the job done  I feel like I could truly say that he has Fi  He has very specific reasons for why he values what he does  and tends to make decisions based on his own preferences rather than others  but there are times throughout the show where he demonstrates an inferior Fe  valuing external thought processes but stubbornly going with his own way  But then there is also a precision in his thought process  to say things accurately and to play with the accuracy of what other people say  He genuinely enjoys being a smartass logical editor of peoples words  and he does it impulsively  which points to Ti dominance  If I am being honest he is likely an ISTP  and if not ISTP then xNTJ   To add  this Sherlock is a highly objective sensor than he is an subjective sensor  He takes in new sensory data very easily  and synthesizes that data into subjective intuition  He definitely plays with possibilities  but more often he sees info and gains insights  rather than references past experiences and then sees external momentary likelihoods  He s definitely an objective sensor  which is why U cant see INTP  His introverted perception tends to be higjly intuitive than sensory based ,intp
This guy is a clear INTP  I don t get where the INTJ votes are coming from    He is a Ti base because of his deduction skills and his ability to analyze everything he comes in contact with  I can see his Si because he is very detail oriented uses the littlest details of his cases and uses those details to help justify his Ti deduction  He is also able to notice things down to even the littlest detail  which is a sign of Si  However  I can notice a lot of Ne in sherlock  like him being able to notice a lot of patterns and for him to come up with multiple possibilities of what would happen in the future  Fe inferior is also really clear  mainly due to Sherlock discarding sentiment as he sees it as something that should never interfere with logic  This is what he said to Irene Adler in  Scandal in Belgravia  when Sherlock figured out the password to Adler s phone being  SHER LOCKED   In the same episode during the Christmas celebration  he felt bad for constantly saying really bad things about others  which shows a little bit of Inferior Fe  I can see a lot of Ne in that episode as well as he came up with many possibilities for what the password is to Adler s phone was  Also  the quote  Your mind is so placid  straight forward  barely used  mines is like an engine  racing out of control  a rocket tearing itself to pieces  stuck on the launchpad  to Watson  The metaphor comparing his mind to a rocket implies Ne compared to Johnson s Ne inferior    I can tell that he is a sx  with elements of a sp  due to Sherlock usually talking  One on One  with Watson since Watson is arguably Sherlock s only true friend  and indubitably his best friend     I can also see him being a Sp  due to Sherlock wanting to be withdrawn and him seeing his flat as a Castle to him as he is always there    Conclusion  Sherlock is a clear INTP sx sp   with high Si    Also  I question why people voted ILE for Sherlock  He doesn t seem to value the Fe image as much as an ILE  Is LII a possible sociotype for Sherlock ,intp
I would just like to add that this man s Fe evolution is by far one of the best I ve seen on television I think he was on a Fe grip on s e  and that was bad for him because it made him spiral but besides that the way he starts taking other people into consideration and makes the effort to understand their feelings is truly such a good character development since in the beginning he practically ignored that function s existence forever proud of him   ,intp
I think his  high Se  is heavily due to his Ti and Si  Personally  my Se is awful and that s the case for most INTPs but there are certain places and situations where I am able to make it look like I use this function better because they are familiar to me  Si   For the average person this obviously doesn t mean an entire city but Sherlock is way beyond the average human and also a fictional character so I think it s plausible that he has most of London stored inside his brain  Because it s useful for his work he more or less memorised the whole city which is why he says in s e  that he wants to go back to London as it is where he works better  Of course he shows other signs of good Se that arent good sense of direction but I think that can be traced to Ti and Si as well and its also not something that comes natural to him because if he s not      focused on solving a case he WILL start zoning out   I don t think looking for physical clues and finding them quickly is enough proof of high Se either because it can also mean he just worked out where they might be by working through non visible clues ,intp
I m glad that we ve established he is a Ti dom  It s quite obvious  As for his tertiary and auxiliary functions  I can see the cause for debate  If I were to vibe type him  I would go for INTP just because ISTPs tend to be a lot more   nonchalant  I hope you get what I mean  But objectively  I can see the argument for both Se and Ne   The interesting thing about this debate is that Sherlock s  perceiving  functions  not the judging  are unclear  That should make sense for a detective because they need to ensure that they ve gathered all possible evidence to arrive at a conclusion  Naturally  they d need to develop all kinds of observational skills   Ne   Necessary for considering all possible scenarios that may lead to a certain crime scene  Se   Necessary for ensuring that all physical evidence has been acknowledged and placed in the bigger picture of the scene  Ni   Necessary for narrowing down the possibilities to the few that are the most likely  Si   Necessary for establishing a precedent for the current crime scene  which will allow for a point of comparison to determine the possibility of certain criminal actions taking place  Sherlock also has his memory palace  which can be attributed to Si   Since Sherlock has mastered being a detective  he necessarily acquired all these traits  I think that s why we re getting confused  He seems to have mastered control over the four perceiving functions    The best way to determine which one he is is to look at his  personal  life  which is itself difficult since his whole life is dominated by his work   Lastly  his enneagram is of interest too  I agree with one of the comments below saying that he was a  w  until the Reichenbach Fall  which is when he exhibited  w  behavior ,intp
SH   Never liked riddles   JM   Learn to    Is that Ti Ne versus Ne Ti  Is it weird that Sherlock  as an INTP and an intellectual  doesn t like riddles  Or is it just me accidentally stereotyping ,intp
He use a lot of Se because he see and think about that he see and he use Ne too cause sometimes he think about differents think and he use t  much ti he is to much smart and use si because memory card  T,intp
i always doubted between ISTP and INTP  and thought for a while  even have rewatched the show  and i m not really sure yet  but that s my opinion so far   first of all  he is a fictional character  original book sherlock is ISTP  but as bbc wanted to put him in modern society  and as they dgaf about mbti  there are def differences  but some points are unchanged  also  let s remember that s he is a fictional character  that is very unrealistic lol  and as he is a gEnIus  he casually uses all perceiving functions  don t try to find his character realistic in any way    TI FE   TE FI   there are so many votes of INTJ  but let s be honest  he can t be te fi user  in short  te are motivated by the result and or efficiency  sherlock is known for doing his work for the process  he doesn t need money  authority or anything else  while everyone around see the obvious immediately  he goes round and round  makes every idea harder than it is  the process is a drug for him  instead of  how to make it faster more effective organize it make the result better      he questions  how is it done    on the other comparing fi tert and fe inf  it s definitely fe inferior  instead of questioning his morals or showing any kind of self reflection   blind fi  he doesn t use fi to judge or struggle with it   he struggles with inferior fe  from the beginning  they show us that he doesn t care about the emotional constituents of others  if he tries to manipulate  than he shows off his real thoughts immediately  bc he doesn t care about how he effects others   a scene when he acts to be dead man s close friend or a scene when pretends to blame a woman  so they could get the information  also his speech at wedding episode  he understands emotions as just another system  and gets criticized for not understanding obvious emotions  but he tries to develop himself sometimes   sherlock s reaction  or the absence of it  to watson saying he is best friend is such a mood  and also the moment when sherlock analyzed molly at christmas  but didn t understand that she loves him  also he has kind of narcissistic  i guess  type  so maybe it s a reason of ppl srsly typing him INTJ  if not bc he is smOrt  however  it doesn t have anything with mbti ,intp
smh to all the guys commenting with public votes,intp
The F M ratio of votes here is           MBTI  currently  which is a bit more than      I m not really sure what it signifies ,intp

O conceito de feminilidade e oque esperam de uma mina literalmente   ESFJ  w  como assim INTP gente,intp
why INTP     ISFJ is the most common among females,intp
INTPs live on the internet that is why the votes are so high  other types are busy getting stuff done ,intp
They do not exist ,intp
If you only show me the   INTP women you know in your life  I will reward you  According to statistics  only    of women are of this type  and since men are slightly more than women  they make up less than    of the population ,intp
why,intp
why is he typed as a lvef  i don t see Kenma as a  V since his volition is so low  i see him more as a  V  i m just learning about ap so if i made a mistake or there s good reasoning for him being a  V pls tell me   ,intp
I honestly can t understand how he s typed as LVEF in attitudinal psyche  FLEV or LFEV are a much better fit for him  Kenma is the laziest and most unmotived player in nekoma  probably in the entire anime actually  Yes  he does hate to lose  but that s not an indicative of high volition  He s not ambitious  motivational or willful like  Vs are  that s even the reason behind all of his arguments with yamamoto lol     May not be concerned with proving themselves or showing off too much confidence  Can ignore how they affect others and stick to patterns until it is mentioned that they should change them  Take extra time to energize themselves  Sometimes let obstacles stay in the way until they actively notice them  Will drift between searching for inspiration and ignoring it  Remain unbothered by volition  even if others are pressuring them   This is a description of  Vs I found on the attitudinal psyche website  and it fits his character way too well  Kenma isn t bothered at all by his teammates criticsm towards his lack of determination  he acknowledges his flawls but willingly decides to ignore them until he had no other choice but to work on himself   Fanon Kenma is the absolute  F stereotype  but that shouldn t be taken into consideration while typing his character  His fanon version is a depressed greesy gamer who hasn t showered or eaten in months  but let s please type his actual character on this website with the actual definition for high F  Types high on physics are all about physical comfort  they love changing their atmosphere to appeal to their needs as much as possible  There are many misconceptions about this definition  some may define high F s as cleaning freaks  interior designers or fashion lovers  but in fact  comfort and physical needs are all very subjective  and for Kenma  gaming alone in his room is enough to fulfill his needs,intp
I am sorry but the   wing in my opinion doesn t fit his character  could someone please explain  ,intp
  Not every smart character is a       Not every INTP is a     Honestly i agree with those comments and I have say the same thing before in different situations  however  this is NOT the case with kenma considering that he s in fact a   core   Before voting you must understand the system  surface level understanding of the enneagram such as typing only based on core fears   desires and integration disintegration leads to awfully mistyped character profiles  People have been mixing up E    E  in the comments a lot  feeding misconceptions and showing how easy to influence individuals from the typology community are  blindly believing whatever   hot take   someone has about x characters type without an actual explanation to back up their points    Ignoring the complaints  kenma shows MANY traits of E s trait structure  such as    Retentiveness  not generous in terms of money time energy  insensitivity to needs of others  hold on to ongoing mental content  not open to environmental stimulation  pessimistic about receiving protection care from others or having the power to demand take what is needed  rigidity in mental function  struggle to transition between mental states   Pathological Detachment  aloof  loner who does not feel lonely  minimization of needs  inhibition and fear of expressing anger  Fear of Engulfment  fear avoidance of being  swallowed up by others   fear of dependency  sensitive to interference interruption  prone to interrupt self for external demands perceived needs of others  over docile  need to find oneself in loneliness  Autonomy  need to do without external supplies  stock up resources in their  ivory tower   idealize autonomy  Feelinglessness  lost awareness of feelings  indifferent  cold  unempathetic  apathetic  diminished capacity to feel pleasure  Postponement of Action  lack enthusiasm to act  excessive restraint  procrastination  Cognitive Orientation  introversive  intellectual  replace living with learning  prepare but never feel ready  dwell in abstraction  avoid concreteness  curious  Sense of Emptiness  sterility  depletion  meaninglessness  inner vacuum  ontic insufficiency  Guilt  guilt prone  like  s   vague sense of inferiority  vulnerable to intimidation  awkward  self conscious  hidden  High Superego  driven  high demands of self and others  perfectionistic  Negativism  wish to not give do as expected from themselves or others  People confuse kenma as sp  for things such as giving up easily  avoiding wasting energy  wanting to be unbothered on his own and just being an average person with a niche interest that brings him comfort such as video games instead of a super genius   robot of knowledge  yes I m phrasing it like this because this is deadass how most people perceive  s    When thats literally him being your stereotypical sp    SUBTYPE KEY  CASTLE Very protective of personal space and privacy  this type sets clear limits and boundaries and is very comfortable living a relatively solitary life with just a few close friends  They would much rather observe social life than participate in it  Often truly introverted  they prefer not to reveal much of their inner self  finding it difficult to lower their guard for fear of losing their privacy or sense of safety   Naranjo   Some extra info about  s that people tend to confuse with  s       EV individuals seem to have concluded at the beginning of their lives that the world will not give them the love they yearn for  and they decide to fix things themselves  minimizing their desires  They distance themselves from the world  which asks more from them than it gives them and puts more impediments in their path rather than helps themand to a certain extent  erases  them  forgets them         These types are neither warm nor ardent  but cool  however  their search for isolation and solitude  their desire not to be interfered with  invaded  subjected to demands  becomes a passion  What others search for outside of themselves  they search for inside  or beyond the interpersonal world in the symbolic  the abstract  or the transcendental        Apart from the resistance to giving  not giving oneself is typical of the  retentiveness  of this character  which is manifested in only being half committed to what one is doing  or in participating in things  while at the same time asking oneself whether it might not be better to save oneself for something else  They are likewise resist  ant to expressing themselves  particularly with respect to communicating emotions  Commitments are difficult  as a result of a desire to economize for a possible better investment of their energies  As a result  the avaricious person is a simple observer of life  hardly living it and wasting opportunities as well as talents     Sources    Character and Neurosis    The enneagram of society,intp
A bit after I replied to the comment below  I was rereading some Enneagram books recently and when reading about E  specifically I ve noticed some type traits might come off as E  ish even though they fit into   core pretty well on it s own  I ll paste some of these paragraphs so you can see my point  for example  the first ever type   trait that gets described in the trait structure is titled  Retentivness   and in it  it mentions this    As usual  it is possible to find in this character a cluster of descriptors corresponding to the dominant passion  In it  along with avarice  belong such characteristics as lack of generosity in matters of money  energy and time  and also meanness with its implication of an insensitivity to the needs of others     Here we can see the conserving mindset we can see in Kenma  the idea that he doesn t need to put in a lot of effort  but rather just enough to pass and complete whatever he s doing  If we continue reading the trait structures we can also see more traits that seem   ish so I ll be pasting them along with which trait section they come from    Also the avoidance of commitment can be considered as an expression of not giving since it amounts to an avoidance of giving in the future  In this avoidance of commitment  however  there is also another aspect  the need of type V individuals to be completely free  unbound  unobstructed  in possesssion of fullness of themselvess a trait representing a composite of avarice and an over sensitivity to engulfment    Not Giving    Again  this is a trait that we see fitting Kenma very well  avoidance of commitement can be clearly seen in his character as I ve mentioned above and in my past threads  but in hand with that we also see the will Kenma has to commit to things that do interest him as well as his over sensitivity to the outside world and not wanting to deal with people due to his sensitivity    The great sensitivity to interference and interruption of ennea type V individuals is not only the expression of a detached attitude  but also a function of the person s proneness to interrupt herself in the face of external demands and perceived needs of others  In other words  a great sensitivity to interference goes hand in hand with an over docility  in virtue of which the individual interferes all too easily with her own spontaneity  with her preferences  and with acting in a way coherent with her needs in the presence of others    Fear of engulfment    I remember reading in someone s comment how Kenma just going along with Kuroo for asking him to play voleyball points towards him being a   core  however after reading this  you can notice  s also tend to do the same  they act in a coherent way in presence of others and can go along with whatever others need them to in order to not stick out and get torn apart by the outside world    The hypersensitive characteristic of ennea type V involves a sense of weakness  a vulnerability and also a sensitivity in dealing with the world of objects and even persons  To the extent that the individual is not completely disconnected from the perception of others  he is gentle  soft and harmless  Even in his dealing with the inanimate environment this is true  he does not want to disturb the way things are  he would like  so to speak  to walk without harming the grass on which he treads    Hypersensitivity    Again  this sounds very   core ish but it s a part of the traits present in the type    this isn t even sp  specifically  just   core overall  This  again  very well applies to Kenma who goes out of his way to try not to get noticed by others  seen in multiple episodes where he tries to stay out of sight and not deal with people  and if he has to deal with them he d rather not make a big deal out of it and just rather follow the other person until the interaction is done and try withdrawing   I ve also checked the subtype descriptions and again  there s certain things in the sp  that could sound   ish  like this for example    In relationships with others  Self Preservation Fives avoid creating expectations or dependent relationships  They also avoid conflict  which is another way they detach from people  They do  however  typically experience a strong sense of attachment to a few places and people  To prevent conflict and manage contact with others  they may adapt to fit in to not be seen    However  along with this  I ve also checked the   core and sp  descriptions and  like I ve said before  there s some things that clearly DO NOT fit Kenma and I still don t understand how   voters keep ignoring obvious issues with this typing and just keep repeating the same points made while not touching upon these traits  For example I ll jump over to some   core traits and paste them here  continued in the replies  ,intp
I had planned on forming some kind of coherent argument looking at both   and   because while I orginally saw him as a   the arguments for   made me completely unsure  However it seems I am still burnt out from school and my interest in Kenmas profile has completely gone away  I reviews the subtypes and rewatched ep    of s  and in my opinion within   minutes of the episode it was very obvious to me he is a    If anything I think this page has really overcomplicated Kenma  Again i dont have the effort nor care to put my thoughts together correctly but i will list some main stuff   His reason for joining volleyball was mostly for his friend Kuroo and he also stated he hasn t quit simply because he can t be bothered and he doesn t care either way  he doesn t like volleyball but he doesn t hate it either  s  ep          I wouldn t keep playing volleyball if i hated it  I just keep playing  I don t have a definite reason to keep playing  but i also dont have a reason to quit  Not having either is pretty normal   To me this is extremely  sp  finding comfort in a daily routine of something like he does with gaming and not really caring at all either way   I think people connect  s to laziness and while this is definetly true and seen in Kenma it also heavily relates to comfort in daily activities and reduction of overstimulation  Ive typed him as sp sx for the reason that Kenma started volleyball out of care for his friends and as we see in the anime he does multiple other things  putting some of his personal cares away for the one person he cares about most  That is to say I wouldnt type him as sx sp as he doesn t completely priorities it and he said himself he wouldnt do hours of practice just out of pity for a friend which then after he continues to say he just doesnt care either way   And another thing is that I just dont think he suites any of the   subtypes or atleast not as much as the   subtypes   This makes absolutely no sense but I have commented on his profile a few times so im leaving this here  You can reply with a counter argument but i probably wont care  dont take it personally im just to busy with school and exams coming up  also i have already read many of the   comments here so chances are ive read it before   I would personally suggest rewatching episode    or season   because like I said before  i think his character has been overcomplicated  Its not to say thats a bad thing idc if people do that or if they type him as a   ,intp
I won t be arguing much about the ennagram but it s funny seeing people type Kenma as a    a gut based type  when he literally had an argument about that with Yamamoto  showed in season    He called his  gut talk  stupid and meaningless and did not understand it so why type him as a gut type  Both   and   arguments make a lot of sense but most of them that I ve read are mixing up   descriptions with   descriptions which just proves more that he is a    Edit  I found some information online  if it s inaccurate and incorrect feel free to correct me in replies Fives and Nines  Fives and Nines share some traits in common  especially from the point of view of an outside observer  Energetically  Fives and Nines can both appear reserved and withdrawn  though Nines do not so much withdraw from others as they forget themselves and neglect their own agendas and preferences in favor of creating harmony and alignment  Both can be good mediators  as Nines can easily see all points of view and Fives are objective analysts  Both Fives and Nines dislike conflict and can be passive aggressive  though Nines may do this out of an inability to feel their anger directly  and Fives may engage in this behavior because they do not want to express their emotions openly or get involved in an emotional situation that could be costly energetically  People of both styles have a way of distancing themselves from their own internal experience  Fives by detaching from emotion  and Nines from forgetting about their own preferences and opinions  When it comes to working with others  both Fives and Nines like structure and regularity  both want to be consulted about what they think and may need time to reflect on that  and both have a sensitivity to and a dislike of being controlled by others   There are also some significant differences between Fives and Nines  In relating to others  at the most basic level  Nines tend to merge with others  as they find comfort in being in harmony with people  while Fives tend to withdraw from others  as they fear being depleted by the needs and demands of other people  Nines are other referencing  tending to pay attention primarily to other people  while Fives are self referencing  focusing more on their own internal experience and boundaries  Related to this  Nines are overly adaptive to others  while Fives are under adaptive to others  Frequently not knowing what they want  Nines tend to avoid stating their preferences and then may later feel resentful that they went along with others and their wishes were not heard  Fives  on the other hand  almost always know what they want  and are adept at preventing others from interfering with what they want to do  Nines are often perceived as friendly and affable and easygoing  while Fives tend to be perceived as more aloof and reserved   Wanting to be close to others in a harmonious way  Nines often don t perceive their need for boundaries  and as a result they don t make boundaries with others  while Fives prioritize making and maintaining their boundaries  Similarly  Nines have a hard time saying no and expressing their own preferences in the face of other people s wishes  while Fives can much more easily say no  Sometimes  Nines will say yes and mean no  while Fives will say no when they want to say no  Because of their boundary issues  Nines may also have a hard time separating from others  while Fives separate from others very easily  sometimes to a fault  as withdrawal constitutes one of their primary forms of self protection  For Nines  paying attention to others  agendas gets in the way of knowing their own  for Fives  paying attention to their own agenda makes it hard to let in and make room for the agendas  and feelings  of others   I personally see him as a    and   voters need to make new arguments and prove their opinions instead of just sticking to the same points and the same argument that we read who knows how many times  As I already said the information I found might be inaccurate and wrong so you re free to correct it in the replies,intp
Kenma is one of the characters you can even type by letters  not really sure why you d want to especially if you know about cognitive functions   ,intp

  Core Argument   Looking at this page it s very clear there are A LOT of misconceptions about both type   and type    along with people misunderstanding the correlation between socionics and enneagram  So  in this thread  I ll seperate this argument into two parts  an enneagram core argument and an enneagram socionics correlation argument  So let s first start off with Kenma s enneagram core  if you re not interested in the socionics part  you can skip that and not read it  it s why I m leaving it as part    I will also credit every single source I have used at the end so you can check for what I said yourself if you  for some reason  don t believe me  Anyways let s start off with his core type   Part    The Core Type  So first we can decide his type in a very simple way  seeing where his core type might fall into  The   triads are as follows  gut triad          heart triad         and the head triad          Now  it s fairly obvious that Kenma is NOT in the heart triad so I won t waste either of our time explaning that  so let s move onto gut vs head  The gut triad  also known as the being group consists of types      and    The types of this triad are identified with their dependency on the physical body and the concrete world around them  and this triad is anger based  with each of the types dealing with anger differently    embraces it    avoids and suppresses it and   who turns it into a rage for perfection terror of being wrong  The head triad  also known as the paranoid group consists of types      and    The types of this triad are identified with using their minds as a form of protecting themselves  being attached to the mental body  The title of the  doing  group could also be assigned to this triad as they are the ones who go through internal dialogue before deciding what to do  This triad is fear based  with each of the types dealing with fear differently   s deal with their fear by reducing life to manageable proportions and withdrawal   s deal with their fear with optimism and  s adopt strategies to create a sense of safety   Now  let s take a look at Kenma  Kenma is someone who does not rely on the physical or his instincts at all like a gut core would  as an example  every time we see him playing he is constantly thinking trying to come up with strategies and figure his opponents out  even signaling the coach to call a timeout as soon as he has enough information to give to his team  Kuroo even calls him a mastermind strategist when they were kids lol   Still not convinced yet  Then  let s move onto comparing the two types    and   below in the replies ,intp
can someone explain his wing  ,intp
we saw him going outside with other people just because his mom said him to go  in practice he don t have a obligation to obey her  she can t drag him out  he have superpowers  if he would really a  sp he wouldn t go out but he vallues more the peace in the environment  in this case  his house  than the desire to be alone  sp    sp,intp
Well he is totally an ISTP His functions etc,intp
ok so i rewatched the show after getting into ennegram  i noticed that saiki has two fears which are linked clsoely to both   and     he has a fear of the unknown  he is scared of bugs because he dosent know what theyre thinking  as he cant read their minds  so much that instead of killing them he just runs away  i can see why hes a   ebcause he has traits of   and   too   but  his core   is much stronger   s core fear is to be in peace with their environment  not cause trouble  his edvident childhood trauma is when he almost got outted out as a psychic  and im not sure why he fosent want to be known other than not wnating to draw attention  but i believe that its becaude he thinks his powers are dangerous and might cause a lot of damage as a whole  although saiki constantly complains about hid friends in the end he sitll helps them  due to his core   of wanting to be connected with others  he could very well flat out reject them but he always makes excuses  next  he has psychic powers  the poerr to wuite literally rewrite the world  but he dosent  he fosent cause destruction  he dosent does anything to change the world  showing his want for peace in the world   i can also see his   and      is orobably because of his upbringing  his mother contsnalty tells him to not shiw his poerrs openly  and he always sticks to that  his   is probably shwon through hsi agression  he always says agressive stuff make like small threatening comments  watch show and observe   he takes revenge on people  and pretty much dosent care for his father  so overall i still think that hes a  w  ,intp

INFJ   seems to be way weirder than ISFJ   imo   I mean  both are weird but at least ISFJ has the sensation factor in their favor  Now Se inf   high Fe is super contradicting with E   especially social blind ,isfj
Just coming up with stuff tbh ,isfj
ESTP  w       ,isfj
How about this ,isfj
I can t imagine an ISFJ  w  either  But hasn t Mother Teresa been typed as this   I m personally a bit sceptical ,isfj
from my own perspective it would me ESTJ  w  or ENTJ  w  even weirder is ESTJ  w  or ENTJ  w ,isfj
I find INTJ  w        w   w   w   to be very strange ,isfj
ISFJ  w  is weird but nothing is impossible I guess  A few weeks ago  I rediscovered my sister  in law  enneagram and turned out she is actually an INFJ  w   This not so regular combination is actually pretty interesting  While she is not that assertive as   core stereotypes  her concessional attitude and behavior fit every   descriptions  At first  I mistyped her as  w  but the more I know about her  she is not that insecurities or too attached to a known system and actually hot headed while maintaining her own logical perception of the world lol  Healthy   is really admirable and something to strive for  I think this can be relatable to ISFJ   but it s kinda hard to imagine if you haven t encountered one ,isfj
Trying to figure what would be a ISFJ  w      Healthy ISFJ  w    Beloved leader of a nation and defender of his culture  with huge respect and admiration even of foreigners  Would also be known as a pratical philosopher  bringing old costumes into a whole new world   Average ISFJ  w    Middle school teacher  often frustrated due to  lost  habits and wasted potentials  but a pleasant companion for family and friends  Intelligent and able to help  but can be arrogant sometimes and never knows what he did wrong   Unhealthy ISFJ  w    Jailed by assault   He tried to punch my dad  People have no respect for elders today    Actually  the guy which tried to  punch  his dad  just had a accidental bump ,isfj
My dad is ENTJ  w  SLI and he is so business but also cares so much about everybody but he has no   traits at all so I know he is  w   Another rare type pairing that I know is one of my classmates who I am     sure is an ESFP  w  ILE because they fit the ENTP nerdy stereotypes but are so obviously Se dom and Fi aux in MBTI   ,isfj
Nezuko Kamado the  ISFJ    Warning spoiling     Nezuko is an INFP for sure let me explain   Not because she is cute no no it s a long explaining so please be patient   When she saw tanjiro getting hit by giyuu All she thinked about was him and she didn t attack giyuu at first but protected tanjiro at first She was impulsive but did the right thing   When she saw the woman and man and she saw them as her siblings she wasn t  Focusing on the past  but remembering someone she deeply loved and missed an ISFJ might focus on the past but wouldn t really put something like that in their mind to remember  Nezuko Little bit unaware of what s going on but she sleeps so she doesn t eat humans  An ISFJ will be really realistic And he will not think of an alternative to this topic and after all nezuko wasn t having any problems after she became a demon but an ISFJ will have a problem since they don t like fickle life they would have grudge in their heart about what happened to their family but nezuko really did understand that even demons felt pain like them so she really didn t hate them that much    Come back soon for more explanation I am tired ,isfj
i don t really understand how this conclusion was came to   we don t get to see much of her personality or reasoning but what we do see is a lot like tanjiro  i think MAYBE ENFJ INFJ but i don t really get ISFJ at all      ,isfj
Why you voting fi dom  Please explain if I agree I can retype  ,isfj
theres not a single argument on how she s ISFJ     w  stereotyping   ,isfj
i think the people voting ISFJ look at her enneagram and run with it,isfj
Why social   and why not sexual   ,isfj
the way her character was written irks me so much  like one of the top comments said  you could replace her with a pet tanjiro had a lot of emotional connection with and literally nothing in the plot would really change    except zenitsu would come across as a lot more creepy than he already is    and it s not that the author  can t write women  in this case  it s pretty obvious that the female characters in this series are well written compared to other shounen  despite their limited chapters  so why did the author write nezuko as an ex machina wonder girl with the mental age of a toddler  her character had so much potential  why did gotouge choose to have her age regress  when other demons didn t  why didn t gotouge use her character  if she had mental capability beyond  all humans are my family   to make the demon slayer conflict less black and white  why does she conveniently just stay placid in her box all the time until the trio is in danger and she needs to save their          for now i think she s utterly unable to be typed  i read some INFP arguments that convinced me that she has fi te  and i think she is definitely fi over fe  even from her age regression  it is stated that  because of urokodaki s influence  she sees all humans as a projection of her family and is therefore more inclined to protect them because of her own personal values towards humanity    but i am iffy about her other functions  like  was it really inferior te  or was she just kicking the ball back because she has the mental state of a toddler  we don t see her cognitive process in that scene at all  was it really auxiliary ne in the scene where she does her blood demon art for the first time  or was it just an intense situation  because inosuke also comes up with new moves in the midst of battle  does that make him a high ne user  you would likely disagree with that  so what makes nezuko a high ne user   ugh  she deserves so much better than being written as borderline loli bait ,isfj
The only reason why it would make sense for people to vote her as an ISFJ would be her careful nature  but that s not enough argument and it s pretty stereotyped  I understand how core  s can seem like Fe users tho   Other than that  how is she a Si dom Ne inf    I don t see that much precautious experience focused down to earth Si traits in her,isfj
If someone explains why she is ISFJ  having Si dom  i can re type,isfj
On a side note   I sometimes pronounce liyue characters in their chinese pronunciation sometimes and it messes with me,isfj
its so funny to me that we have the exact same MBTI and enneagram   i didn t even notice lmaoo anyways ISFJ  w  s are the coolest ever  starts sobbing    as an amendment i would love to be one but oops,isfj
Could anyone explain why Ganyu is a so    I personally see sp sx or sx sp fitting more  Ganyu is always giving her entire attention towards her work and distracts herself with it seems to be a big part of her character  Social  s merge themselves and prioritizes the group around them higher than themselves because they feel like they are never apart of anything else  this is what drives social  s to be generous and sacrificing  Although I can see why social   might make sense because of her not really fitting in with humans and putting all of her effort into her work  I think sx would fit better than social for her  The sx   merges with close people and unconsciouslly takes on their values and opinions because it feels too hard to understand what they want  Sx  s are also very sweet and the least outspoken of all the other  s and sometimes they can get too involved with others and they betray their own needs and they may rebel or ignore important things and important people in their life which is what happened during her quest ,isfj
I realized there was not really a proper argument from what I could see about her ap  I mentioned below I thought she was fevl  so I thought I may aswell explain it  Feel free to explain why shes a different type below though    I don t really find Ganyu to fit into  E   E is focused on their personal feelings  how they feel about things and how they feel about the experiences they are put in  They believe in expressing their emotions  Thought it doesn t need to be vocal I believe  maybe internal or expressed elsewhere  and are confident in their ability to do this  they also aren t likely to be swayed by emotions surrounding them   E is others negative but self positive and I don t really see this in Ganyu     E on the other hand is more flexible to emotion  changing emotions to fit the circumstances and help others  they still want to express it but are more interested in discussing these emotions with others and helping others with this aspect    Confident physics has a strong interest in their own concept of the physical world  think  F fits her quite well  she wants to create a comfortable space and embracing her environment a lot which is littered throughout her voice lines  she believes in her opinions on tastes  aesthetics and her likes and dislikes  She takes care of herself in a way that suits her needs  She also seems to be uncompromising when it comes to her lifestyle choices    I don t understand why people insist on going all out to try and prove how their existence is more valuable than everyone else s  To exist in the first place is a beautiful thing  and that s enough    isn t it     Drink only spring water  eat only whole grains   that s my motto  So  I would be grateful if you could please remove that treacherously enticing looking plate of delicacies from my field of view  Much obliged     If you lie on the grass  you can feel the heartbeat of the world     But my strict vegetarian diet is completely different from everyone else s  And I don t really share their interest in shopping or lively forms of entertainment    Her  v is prevalent and is already voted  but if anything needs explaining there I can  Lmk errors I made since my knowledge of ap isnt the greatest  Just so I can know for next time  ,isfj
Hello if possible could we consider actually correctly typing her ap  shes a very clear  e  a majority of her lines and quest show her  e  I m really thinking fevl  If anyone actually has an argument for elvf tell me  I feel she has been mistyped for too long,isfj
Ganyu is usually very quiet and reserved  she also finishes any task until the end and her meals too  even if she is tired or working hard  Ganyu s obligations to Qixing often make her do previous work with whimsy  but her load doesn t hinders her  and she also gets along well with co workers who admire her  she takes good care of her helpers and offers her knowledge to help them in any problem no matter if it is difficult  medium or easy she is strong and manages to do everything within her limit but she is a very forgetful person due to her age and sometimes forgets important details but she doesn t like it and feels ashamed because she wants to have a pleasant  prudent and productive position for everyone who sees beyond that she just wants to have her inner peace  she avoids any kind of conflict and prefers to agree with others than to agree and ends up showing her point of view  she thinks that this can cause some kind of conflict  She can be a wise person  calm  reserved and likes to please others and put her position to try to maintain a pleasant atmosphere for everyone to do the same with her  respect and like her  she also prefers to be more in her corner of thinking or sleeping prefers to be quieter and alone but she can even be nice to people who dislike her in order to find her adorable as she is ,isfj
I m gonna be honest I think people saw   in her because her story quest was a high stress event and though she tried her best to hide being nervous and anxious  it still lay beneath her surface  She underwent a slight disintegration    But when you watch it she is in complete denial of actually being unhappy about  suddenly assuming she s been replaced  She accepts it automatically because she doesn t want to go back and check because this is the natural flow of things  to her at least  such a typical nine coping strategy  This pseudo calmness and being in touch with the universe  Except  not really  and it s just a way to distance oneself from one s ongoing life affairs ,isfj
why calm and not limbic  not really certain on this one so insight would be nice   ,isfj
shes just like me fr kinda,isfj
I know that it s a huge consensus in this page but I d just like to point out that she s a very type   character   Her entire character is about lacking inwardness  passion  desire and trying to meet everyone needs and wants  completely forgetting of herself in order to do that  She sees herself as nothing  she s not important or interesting  Madoka isn t her own person and is essentially no one because she constantly neglects herself to give herself to others   SPOILER  This becomes especially obvious when she makes her wish where she literally becomes nobody gives up of being herself in order to give herself to others  demonstrating the typical abnegated nature of  s   Just to finalize I ll just put here a quote from Naranjo about  s that really seem to resonate with Madoka    A type IX individual is not only one who ends up  carrying the bucket   but a dependable as well as generous person ready to carry a large load over his or her shoulders  If in most cases the failure to embody the ideal of loving one s neighbor as oneself comes from loving oneself more than one s neighbor  in ennea type IX  the situation appears as the opposite  for the over adjusted postpone their own good and the satisfaction of their needs in an excessive yieldingness to the demands and needs of others          Both self alienation and abnegated over adaptation involve resignation   a giving up of oneself  an abdication from oneself and from life  It is as if the individual endorsed a strategy of playing dead to stay alive  yet becoming tragically dead in life in the name of life   Though resignation underlies over adaptation it deserves to be considered by itself in view of the prominence of traits involving laziness in regard to one s needs  contentedness  and giving up or not standing up for one s rights  ,isfj
To the ten FVEL voters  how does she have insecure emotion  She definitely seemed to have insecure volition  as that was her main struggle during the anime ,isfj
can someone explain why phlegmatic  dominant    phlegmatic melancholic ,isfj
i think her socionics type might make it easy to confuse her for INFP  she definitely uses socionics Fi and EII is also a lot more common for INFPs than ISFJs,isfj
i do think shes an ISFJ and all BUT WASNT SHE LIKE INFP LIKE   TWO MONTHS AGO MAYBE OMG wow,isfj
finally an ISFJ who isnt mistyped as an INFP,isfj
If madoka took the   p test she would get INFP A,isfj
It s so satisfying to see a character who s typing is very clear   I do see some INFP voters here  however  and while Fi traits are there  Madoka wanting to find what she  truly  wants to wish for  trying to look into her own feelings  etc   but her Ne is almost nonexistent  That s why it s inferior   ISFJ makes a lot more sense  as her Si guides her through her life  She s careful  shy  but shyness isn t exclusive to Si users  and relies on what is familiar to her  As for her Fe  well  it s very obvious  She s bubbly  kind  and sells her soul to save humanity  She is very selfless  values the feelings and needs of others before her own  how she wants to be a goddess and take everybody s burdens on her own before her own want to be a normal human girl  and doesn t depend on her own feelings to navigate her life  like a strong Fi user would  Feel free to tell me if I missed anything ,isfj
Why Fe  not Fi  I think I ve come up with a reason but I still confused    Madoka           Fi        Fe                             Madoka                                   Madoka                                                       Madoka                   Fe            Sayaka                             Sayaka             Sayaka                Sayaka     Sayaka                        Fi  Fe                          Madoka                                                                                      Madoka                   Madoka                                     Madoka                               Fi                    Fe       Fi                      Fi Fe        ,isfj

Why is he still RLOAN and     at this point   If he was a      he would be a lot more passive and conflict avoidant and an organized type would be a lot less impulsive  I was thinking more of the rescuer or the justice fighter   In later seasons  he develops a rebellious streak which often causes him to be at times hedonistic and impulsive  He is less willing to go along with Rick than he is rebelling against him and sometimes ditching him  His morals and altruism now rarely come up  In early episodes  he would rebels against anything that he sees as morally wrong and now it just seems like he rebels against anything out of selfishness and is now more willing to resort to violent and rebellious methods to reach his goals and can sometimes ditch his original morals in order to do what he wants to do or in order to get back at Rick  which is why he went on a wild rampage in the vat of acid and        up his garage  At one moment  he can be heroic  helping people from Rick s mess then the next he is a villain  going around killing people for his own selfish desires  He scolds Summer for bullying Jerry but he did a similar rant in the app episode   Btw I m really confused as to what is going on with this guy s type  In early episodes  he was a   and now he s just so completely different to the point that I don t think is enneagram  and for some people his mbti type  apply anymore despite discussions that those types can t change  I guess trauma does that to you  It just completely       you up  But whatever he is  he is unhealthy in every way  ,isfj
It feels like early series Morty may have been an ISFJ  but now he is being written as a Fi dominant type sometimes  most likely INFP because the Si is still there  Some of the humor now is him getting irritated by Summer s strong Se usage  There are some episodes where he is an ISFJ  and others where he is an INFP  Right now  I would say that Morty is most likely an unhealthy ISFJ with heavily suppressed Fe and Ne over an INFP  but his character is so inconsistent that he appears to be an unhealthy INFP with limited Ne in certain episodes ,isfj
ISFP arguments have convinced me but I m open to other types    Couple things   ISFJ voters argue that Morty has Si because of how he gets worried and doesn t think going along with Rick is a good idea  However  worrying in itself doesn t have to do with Si  Morty isn t worrying because he s leaving the comfort of his house necessarily  he s just worrying because he thinks it might be dangerous  and thinking something is dangerous has nothing to do with Si    I think Morty is really aware of his surroundings and his tert  Ni gives him a bad feeling about what s going to happen  Also  I think it develops later on in when he starts standing up to Rick more because he s beginning to pick up on the pattern of   Every time I don t stand up against him  I end up being dragged into more danger     ISFJ voters also argue that Morty goes along with what Rick says a lot of the time  therefore Fe  honestly that argument doesn t make sense to me  Fe users already have set social rules on what should and shouldn t be done  and coupled with Si  Morty probably would have been much more going against Rick because that s just not something he sees people do in the past    If anything  INFJ makes more sense than ISFJ  but I think they would have wanted to know what was going on rather than just jumping in   Beth said on one occasion that Morty doesn t have any friends  which means Rick might be the only one who pays any attention to him  He s got it ingrained in him that he s stupid  seeing as how he doesn t object when Rick calls him so  and the way his parents and teacher treat him  Coupled with his Se desire to hands on learn  it doesn t seem too unreasonable that he s willing to go along with the one person who seems to consider him valuable   Speaking of learning  Morty doesn t do well in school  but we ve seen that he s invented portal fluids hands on learning Se   defeated Gonorrhea in that anatomy episode Se   and is the first to realize the insect parasites only work on positive memories Ni   He seems to be a hands on learner  rather than someone who can sit at a desk all day and focus    Also I see a TON of inferior Te in this kid  There was  Look Who s Purging Now  where he completely snaps and starts killing everything  and even Rick is surprised at how brutal he s being  Before that  he tried to help a girl  who betrayed them and shot his companion  After that  he gets personally attacked after hearing a really boring story and blamed for something that wasn t his fault  This is a really stressful situation  and one that made him realize his Fi wasn t doing anything  sending him into Te  He even threatens to kill Rick who has to taser him to calm him down ,isfj
The arguments are very interesting  But I think that he uses fi rather than fe which is a very common miss type  I think he is a pretty good example of a inferior te  for example he doesn t care about the strategies that rick makes or the external logic of the world he lives in and      like that  and I cannot see a ounce of ti in him  I personally think he is just a fi si loop if there s any better explanations I m free to read your perspective ,isfj
I don t see why people still think he s a    That seemed to be something that was apparent in season   but now  he s not so anxious anymore although his toxic self seems to say otherwise but he tends to hide it  He now faces situations head on instead of avoiding or fearing them and won t hesitate to put himself in danger to solve problems or just out of impulsivity  He also can be domineering  as you can see when he had the death crystals and at the time where he lived with no consequences  he was extremely manipulative and ruthless  He acts cocky and bossy toward Rick and has anger issues  I think Rick s   vibes are rubbing off on him   I also would flip the phlegmatic melancholic since he s much too emotional to be a phlegmatic and like I said  slowly becoming less and less tolerant and calm ,isfj
Morty is ISFJ  Change my mind ,isfj
Morty is an idealist  which is why he and Rick have the arguments they do  Rick is a realist  a scientist  Morty is more of an artist  Hes imaginative  creative  and open minded  secondary Ne  but his actions are usually to generate his own internalized peace and ideals  Big Fi user ,isfj
Why are his cognitive functions fi fe ti te ,isfj
The morty shield episode kind of implies that he s whatever the opposite of Rick is,isfj
The Si dom is so obvious it s painful  No way he can be INFP  Morty definitely seems to layer his reality with the absurdity of what Rick drags him through instead of processing fantasy over what he knows to be realistic   Just makes way too much sense for him to be Ne inferior with how he rationalizes his surroundings and environments   Morty definitely exists in his own head  but that s not something that only intuitives are capable of  It s just through his own experiences with Rick that shapes his worldview  And when I think you get to a point where you have gone through as much as Morty has  anything seems realistically possible ,isfj
Chongyun as an ISFJ was an alien concept to me  until I played his hangout quest  I literally was like   THERE IS NO WHAT IF  CHONGYUN IS AN ISTJ    but    that was such a stupid assumption   The thing is about Chongyun    he doesn t even need to try socializing  since it comes natural to him  even when he doubts it  And also  his main concern is being  interesting enough  or that the kids won t like him  or think he s boring   Let s compare him to some INTPs who have inferior Fe  like Albedo and Kokomi  Albedo doesn t find socializing important  and he even complains about the struggles about it  like trying to maintain a relationship with other people  Kokomi s inferior Fe shines in her story quest  She has to try her very hardest to even understand the emotions of others  and she finds it tiring to even do so   With Chongyun  he didn t even try  He was more afraid that his inferior Ne might make him a boring person to talk to  because he always sticks to principles that are in his comfort zone  and I don t think he is the type of person to take such big risks himself  unless if someone drags him to take risks   Lastly  I think his dominant Si can really be seen with the different methods he uses to keep his Yang energy at balance  and this also connects with his absence of Te  Instead of going with methods that are practical and efficient  he uses stuff that he s used to  like his infamous blue popsicles   Anyways  that is all for my argument about Chongyun s functions  If I did say anything out of the ordinary  or wrote something wrong  do tell ,isfj
I don t have a good handle on his Attitudinal Psyche type and I m curious to know the consensus  opinion  Can someone explain FLVE    ,isfj
his dominant Si is pretty obvious  but if you pay attention at his story  the ending with the two kids   you can see how his aux function is clearly Fe  also in the little girl ghost ending    ,isfj
There s a lot of explanations for his Si dom already  so I ll just leave a comment about his Fe  while it s not as obvious as the other strong Fe users in Genshin  I think his Fe is much stronger than it s given credit for and I ll try to explain why  w   I ll mainly talk about his hangout as I feel like that s where his Fe is displayed the most  one of the routes in it was him giving the popsicles he uses to control his Yang energy to a child because they thought it looked tasty  then once he makes more he gets sidetracked from his mission and decides to give the new popsicles he made to the children  gets pulled into playing hide and seek with them  and then cooks a meal for them when they re hungry   Chongyun   These popsicles really are delicious   I bet that kid we met earlier would be thrilled to taste this flavor   Chongyun   He mentioned his family is not well off  I d still like to help them if I can   Traveller   But what about your search for evil spirits   Chongyun   Exorcism is my means of helping the people of Liyue live more peaceful and happy lives   Chongyun   If that kid really needs my help  then helping him would just be different means to the same end    And he really wasn t stressed by suddenly having to play with children nor did he find any of it overwhelming  his concern throughout was hoping he wouldn t be seen as boring by them   Little Le   Now that we re done  let s play more games   Chongyun   M  More games  Chongyun   This is completely unexpected for me  I was sure that everyone would just think I m boring      He also seems quite concerned with social niceties and maintaining harmony as high Fe users tend to be  always making sure to thank you for every bit of kindness you show him and even reminding himself to thank Xingqiu personally for always being helpful after a conversation about him  in another route he tries to ask others about any information they could have about evil spirits in the area in order to keep them safe  apologizing when he unintentionally spooks them and trying his best to be polite to others even when they are being a little unreasonable to him  for no reason rly like what was the deal with the people in the Test of Courage they were such jerks    Also throughout the hangout he s constantly praising and complimenting the Traveller for various reasons  as well as trying to lift their spirits when they seem disappointed   Chongyun   Interesting   I have never had any fear of evil spirits  so perhaps I m unable to understand their feelings   Chongyun   It s amazing that you re able to pick up on that  Good thing I brought you as my partner     Chongyun   Thank you  Traveller  now I have lots of popsicles  Your skills are amazing   Chongyun   If I d known you d possessed such skills  we could ve made more for that kid and his family     Chongyun   Hm  Why do you seem so disappointed   Traveller   I can t help but feel like this was a waste of our time   Chongyun   No  quite the contrary  Not only did we clean up the traces of the evil spirit  we also took care of those monsters  We ve done our jobs as exorcists   Traveller   Hmm  I guess you re right   Chongyun   Yes  so please cheer up   Chongyun   Actually  I also wanted to thank you for not leaving me   even with my special condition   and for helping me chase the evil spirit to the very end   Chongyun   Even if we d ended up running into an incredibly strong demon  I would ve felt much safer with an experienced adventurer like you by my side    His main goal as an exorcist is to protect others and help them feel safe  utilizing tried and true methods and the experience he s gathered throughout his life to aid others dutifully  he s a very clear Si Fe user to me    Also him not knowing how to play hide and seek and hiding in a terrible spot because it was the type of place evil spirits usually enjoyed hiding in was so Si dom  he s such a sweetheart ,isfj
moonchase quest definitely clarified fe for me with the small amount of lines he had  fe   fi no doubt,isfj
Why does he have a   fix in his tritype  Wouldn t a   fix fit him better ,isfj
WAAA I KNOW i just commented  but menhera s suggestion about chongyun being rloai makes sm sense tbh  i think ISFJs or sensors in general tend to be voted non curious but chongyun is super inquisitive in his hangout quest  always asking questions especially when he realizes he s misread the situation  as an rloan i m more prone to taking note that i didn t understand something but generally accept it and move on without seeking the reason as to how or why it happened  chongyun on the other hand seems genuinely curious about what he doesn t understand and is quick to make efforts to learn,isfj
for those wondering about chongyun s dominant si inferior ne   si doms approach the world with knowledge of their past experiences and understandings  curating a way of life based on that  in chongyun s case  he takes cautious and repetitive steps to ensure that he can keep his yang energy in check  such as avoiding heated experiences  feelings  foods  etc  through trial and error  he seeks to build stable and reliable means of navigating the world  chongyun is drawn to tried and true methods of training to become a better exorcist   dom si   rather than seeking out alternative methods or possibilities like his friends such as xiangling or xingqiu have suggested   inf ne     another instance of chongyun s inferior ne is the way in which he reads into the information he gathers  he tends to miss implications and double meanings  especially during his hangout quest when at the test of courage attraction  he takes it all very literally and doesn t consider that peoples words or the event itself might not be all that it seems until he s told otherwise  chongyun becomes confused and uncertain when other perspectives are introduced to him which is something low ne users often struggle with    and finally  one of his unlockable voice lines  borrowing this from the user elinami below cos i agree this quote rlly illustrates his si ne     to permanently banish the forces of evil from the world is my ultimate goal as an exorcist  if that grand day ever comes  i suppose i should be able to consider trying many new things  such as hot springs  jueyun chilis  and    partaking in other activities of a more passionate nature  ugh  what am i doing    ugh  i shouldn t be dwelling on these things  even thinking about them is too stimulating for me       chongyun   story      chongyun shies away from considering alternatives to the life of stability and caution that he s crafted and worked so hard to maintain  he values above all the way of life he understands has been the safest and most effective based on his experiences from the past  if that isn t si ne idk what is ,isfj
    s are discerning  caring and inquisitive  They want to be ethical  helpful and cooperative  Highly responsible  they are most comfortable when you do things by the book and know what to expect  Focused on the needs and concerns of others  they seek ways to be of service  Their life mission is to find structured ways to give  and be of assistance to others  A true helper  they are happiest when they are in a position to support others achieve their goals  They can be overly fixed in your opinion of what is right and be rigid in your expectations of theirself and others and thus come across as disapproving or militant   could someone explain why     over      i think     really fits him,isfj
People typing Bert as IxFP instead of ISFJ isn t the only mistype that was happening on this page  Bertholdt is neither a     nor someone with dominant Sp    In my view  Bertholdt is a wonderful example of Social       Social Type   expresses the passion of laziness by merging with the group  These  s works hard to support the group s interests and needs by putting them ahead of their own needs  A Social   is very pleasant  affable and good conversationalist   You have a deep need to feel part of things and the group  in some way to bridge a sense of being different or not fitting into the group or community  So  he tries to compensate for this feeling by being generous and sacrificing himself  working as necessary to meet the expectations and needs of the group     An extremely remarkable thing about Bertholdt is the way he puts the group s needs and feelings above his own  so much so that there are times when he seems like a social   for that very reason   He can t even help himself  but he still helps the group and the social  putting their feelings above his own  Even being able to sacrifice himself if it means the social will have peace  as he did in the end of season    that whole scene was a great mix of high Fe     social    If he were really a dominant   Sp  he wouldn t act like that  the way Bertholdt deals with forgetting his own pain revolves around helping and taking care of the group  focusing on the social to forget about his own pain  If he were a dominant   sp he would try to forget about his pain by focusing not on people  but on things like activities or hobbies   Not to mention that I don t really understand the votes for SpSx  this typing doesn t make any sense to me  SpSx are people who can be very averse to joining groups and this is by no means the case with Bertholdt       of his motivations revolve around group and social things  Not to mention that he has a lot of Sx blind characteristics  he is terrible with things related to chemistry and connection so I don t really understand this   He is an extremely mediating and serene person precisely because he is social    not to mention that a very remarkable characteristic in people who have the dominant social instinct is to justify their actions with  I did it for the group  or  I did it for us   something very characteristic of Bertholdt   Another thing I would like to point out is that people with dominant Social instincts tend to be extremely selective with people   The fact that didn t make friendship with the Survey Corps doesn t have to do with So blind  he didn t make friends with the people there because he already had his own social circle in which he participated and focused  Reiner  Annie and Marley s people   In his view  the people there were a danger not only to his social group  but to humanity  so why make friends with them  Having a social instinct does not mean making friends with everyone  but rather overvaluing the social circle that participates   Bert does have traits related to the Sp instinct  mostly because of self care   but all the traits I see in relation to the Sp instinct are very minor  Despite having a secondary Sp    sp in itself is not a type that makes sense with Bertholdt s character  I think he is a  w  SoSp which sometimes looks a lot like a social   due to the strong   in the tritype   But overall   Sp dom doesn t make sense to his character ,isfj
His MBTI type is hard to identify  but i m sure his socionics type is SEI and he s   core  About mbti type  between ISFP and ISFJ,isfj
Can someone give an example of his auxiliary Se  Because Im       sure he does not use extraverted sensing especially as a parent function,isfj
Why exactly Fe   Fi  Loyalty can t be the dead giveaway here   ,isfj
Although my final typing is ISFJ  I also think the possibility of Bert being ESFJ is valid  In fact  i never ruled out this possibility because it makes sense    xSFJ itself are two types that super suit Bertholdt s character due to the cute high Fe  the lack of impersonality  Low Ti  and the yearning for multiple future possibilities  Low Ne   But I really don t understand why some people put him as IxFP   Also  when I first came to this page months ago i was quite surprised to see that people were arguing between ISFP vs INFP rather than ISFJ vs ESFJ lol   The only explanation i see for this is confusing Fe with Fi  but otherwise  it doesn t even make sense as a stereotype   But well  i m glad to see my favorite character being typed correctly  now we just need to try to change the instincts and the tritype     I plan to do texts explaining why I see Bert as a     SoSp,isfj
W for whoever chose that picture,isfj
YAYYY he s finally ISFJ,isfj
why Fe Fi   gen          ,isfj
I really feel sorry for him  He was just like Armin who was forced by Eren to attack innocent people in Liberio district  Pertholt also was forced by Renier to do the same to paradise island  In the end Armin and pertholt hated themselves and felt of guilty because they consider themselves inhumane ,isfj
Can someone please tell me where is his Fe auxiliary  ,isfj
clear phlegmatic omg even the mbti votes prove it  i d expect an xsfj to be phlegmatic as well,isfj
pam is  in my opinion  one of the clearest ISFJs ever  at the start of the show her Si was super strong  she was always in her comfort zone  discarded the idea of changing her situation  her engagement to roy  for example  and accepted the idea of her life being ordinary and quite boring  her friendship with jim  Ne dom  was the only way for her to expand her ideas and views  inf Ne  and to finally break free from her toxic relationship  another example of Si is when she is offered by jan a place at an art school in new york but she rejects it because of her own personal limitations   as for her aux Fe she always tries to get along with others and go as far as help angela  who always held quite a grudge against her   or mediate between opposites in order to avoid conflicts  she also thinks about how others would feel about something  like when she goes to karen after angela mistreated her and offers her help for the party  or when she suggests jim to rent a room for karen  despite this going against her   her tert Ti could probably be seen hand in hand with her Si  for example when she talks about buying a beautiful house and then discards the idea saying  dreams are just that  dreams   because it does not seem like a logical idea to her  especially given her work and personal life   as i said before  her inf Ne is what draws her in the first place to jim and eventually thanks to him she is able to overcome her own limitations  for example when she  at the end of the show  decides to let jim get the job in austin and move her family across the country despite being initially against it     i guess watching the office    times really gave me a grasp of the characters  personalities ahahaha,isfj
 I hate the idea that someone out there hates me  I hate even thinking that al Qaeda hates me  I think if they got to know me  they wouldn t hate me   literally impossible not to be this combination of type and enneagram  lmao,isfj
i think she is a social    social  s are more interested in actively participating in a community and bringing people together  unlike the other   subtypes  who usually just sit back and don t care if there is external conflict  social  s will do their best to solve these conflicts and make sure the environment around them is peaceful  sometimes even sacrificing their own needs  if it means peace is preserved,isfj
Can t believe people thought she was an INFP  she s such a clear ISFJ   Si   Pam is all about comfort and everyday routine  she oozes Si  Everything outside what she s familiar with makes her uncomfortable   Fe   Obviously very caring to those around her  she helps people in the office like Dwight for instance when he had relationship issues even though it means people tend to walk over her   Ti   uses her own logic and judgement when making decisions instead of relying on objective truth  She thought that leaving her job and working for Michael was a good idea despite objectively that not being the case   Ne   inferior Ne is whole point of the arc when quitting her job and working for Michael  She went on it on a whim impulsively and thought she made a terrible mistake leaving her comfort zone  She dislikes the new and prefers the true and tested ,isfj
She presents herself as a fairy moth  soft spoken and lovable and nice and quiet and harmless but it s pure cowardice  likes to take advantage of people and go to the bank laughing at them in their back every single time  She isn t very complex at all  nor well read  She s simple  Basic  She s a nurse  a secretary with contempt under a smiling and passive veneer  I would say that machiavellianism is extremely high in her  narcissism too  but aggression and extroversion  social boldness is medium low  agreeableness is high  even if the intentions are dark  the presentation is polite  flexible  accepting  non confrontational   and she s quite organized and I don t think has a problem in that regard in her life  was scheduled to marry a  bad bad guy   lol  the writers of this show facilitating mate poaching   but fixed that with a loving and mutually beneficial relationship with a fellow that is equally likeable and equally insincere  less enterprising but more outspoken  way more complex  basically very little in common except the joy of living that both get in taking advantage of others and laughing at their expense   Physically  I find that she s attractive to me  But I m not letting that stop me from making sense ,isfj
So Pam is an obvious ISFJ for me  I have ADHD so i m using my own experiences to make a point ahaha    When i started the show i thought that I was so much like Pam  I thought that people saw me like a Pam  When I mentioned that to a friend she answered me  No way  you are shy but you are way more assertive about the things that you want   and she was right and i think that s the main point to understand if Pam is either an INFP or ISFJ  I m not saying that ISFJs can t be assertive  they obviously can  I m just saying since INFPs have FiNe they are way more prone to act whenever something doesn t feel right for them  I would never stay in a job for so long if i didn t like it and i would never be someone s fianc e for so long if it didn t feel right for me either  My ex boyfriend often said to me that he was scared whenever i started to feel even a little bit of doubt about our relationship because i would act about it  i hate the feeling of not being myself or not feeling like myself in a relationship  I can only speak for myself  but as an INFP  i can handle change  yes sometimes i m scared but if something feels right for me i would do it  Pam acts more as an SiFe user than an FiNe user  she does her job and she s going to get married because that s the right thing  that s what she  should  do  I still relate to her but i think that s mostly because we are both type    at the end of the day Pam is more of a dutiful person than she is of a dreamy person ,isfj
i can see why people vote INFP  but her Fe is too obvious  i think she is just ISFJ with healthy Ne,isfj
                                         ,isfj
I think she is ISFJ and INFP both in different episodes scenes  This could sound weird but she is a Fictional character after all  I know she seems like ISFJ a lot but I also know that she self reference A LOT when trying to help or giving an advice to someone  That moments are obviously Fi   I think this character has problems in its designing  Edit   And we see Inferior Te in S  E   Wtf is wrong with this character   Also actor s acting is pretty bad unfortunately  This could be the cause of this dilemma ,isfj
ISFJs are treated better than other SJs in MBTI community Change my mind  ,isfj
Based on what I ve seen online ExxJs are pretty disliked  especially ExTJs  but I feel like we help push society forward which is useful in it s own right  Also we aren t all      screaming machines lol ,isfj
ISFJs are so awesome ,isfj
All the sensors are v underrated in my opinion    I just wanna give them all a big hug I love them sm,isfj
ISFJS ARE SO UNDERRATED AND MISREPRESENTED I LOVE THEM,isfj
ISFJ is def the most underrated  and i used to b part of the problem  when i heard they were the most common  turns out the source for that was wrong  because they aren t the most common  i just assumed they were basic LmAo  uh yeah so they re only like   percent of the population thats only   percent more than ENTP my type    percent isn t a lot of people    like  i really went and developed a whole superiority complex over this didn t i its funny because most of the time my favorite characters end up being ISFJ  sam gamgee from lotr HES THE BEST  or characters that act similar  like hagrid  hes not an ISFJ but he s close    plus  since personality type is completely random  in     years ENTJ could end up being the most common type for women ITS LITERALLY RANDOM,isfj
Ok  not that I m trying to be narssistic and attention seeking  more just sticking up for the  s out there  I could also easily name other types that are underrated   attachment types firstly       s in general    tend to be seen as basic people pleasing types with no defining qualities  probably why they mistype more   their ability to adapt to the social atmosphere can give them more complexity then some other types   that s why it s hard for them to really see themselves in their main type sometimes    s   possibly the most underrated   like people tend to forget they re here  and  s   while they tend to be recognized for their strength  they frequently only have their negative aspects exaggerated  You d come to be surprised to find that many  s are actually perfectly sane  rational  likeable people  Not all of them are aggressive  bossy  controlling  and impulsive  They can actually have huge hearts  an all or nothing mentality   namely when they integrate to      You might think  s are supposedly well liked here with the  oh they re so cute and impossible to hate   but I m not fooled    Dig a little deeper into the polling section  and I think  s are actually given more      then necessary   on this site  I think it s actually particularly bad  Some polls here overexaggerate their negative sides   which are most of the time complete bs and only apply to extreme cases or unhealthy  s   lazy  unmotivated  a doormat  naive  easily manipulated  avoids problems no matter what  boring  unintelligent  has no defining traits  unable to think for themselves or have opinions at all   to name a few common misconceptions I m sick of people spreading around  Tbh  I think  s are more well liked and appreciated irl then they are in this community  What about when they re at their best  Ironically  you d be surprised to find they can be strong  resilient  wise  have strong opinions  be insightful  autonomous  and get this   perfectly willing and able to resolve conflict  For someone to be      conflict avoidant is just ridiculous   and impossible  Conflict is a normal  sometimes necessary part of life and life would be kind of boring without it   even I know this lol  While it might make me uncomfortable yes  leaving conflict unresolved actually bothers me more then conflict itself  so it s worth it in the long run    What most people also fail to understand is that when it comes to  s   sloth  really shouldn t be taken that literally and doesn t always mean lazy in a physical sense  Unfortunately some people are so ignorant it happens anyway  You d come to be surprised that shockingly  most aren t actually lazy or unmotivated at all   by contrast many  s can actually be ambitious  active  accomplished  and harkworking  especially so  s or  s with a strong connection to     Sometimes inertia can mean being so set on a course of direction  remaining constantly active and on the go  and not knowing when you should slow down or change course   Laziness  tends to just mean laziness to the self   a struggle with taking time to priotize and really focus on what s right for ourselves  Growth for  s means overcoming self neglect and learning to give love and attention to themselves  It s the first step for them in recognizing that their prescence matters    ,isfj
ISTPs in general are way to underrated  I always make friends with them  They re just the best ,isfj
ESTJ s will save us all,isfj
I agree that ISFJs are really well liked and talked a lot among sensors  therefore making them possibly not underrated  but yall need to understand that some people might not have any good experience or maybe even has terrible experience with more underrated sensors like ESTJ  ESFJ  or ISTJ which could result in people not even considering them   Anyways i think ESTJs are adorable muahh  I like how they have Fi Inf yet also uses si  which sometimes is a very sentimental function  So cute ,isfj
Lmao,isfj
Oh  you rascals  ,isfj
Lol  I don t even know what to say  Do you know what to say  Because I sure don t ,isfj
Well this just proved it ,isfj
I just knew as soon as I saw the ISFJ votes that the ENTPs were taking over ,isfj

She s so annoying  I hate her so much ,isfj
Her Fe was so annoying in the class trial  God i hate her,isfj
i want somebody to explain why shes a so  without mentioning her fe,isfj
Remember whenever everybody was here being like  ISFJ   nurse  without any valid arguments ,isfj
soc    she acts helpless and      for attention like with her constant tripping stunts  thought thats more sp   where s the obvious pride and leader mentality of soc  in her cuz i dont see it  ,isfj
SO     LMFAOOO PDB iv typing    ,isfj
danganronpa fandom die faster,isfj
ne inf makes the most sense  and i dont understand why you must fight saying  but look mikan uses more fe so shes ESFJ  the roles of the functions matter a whole lot  mikan could use si and fe the same or fe even more but tert ne and inf ti will not make sense for her at all ,isfj
 spoilers for sdr  chapter       couldn t she be sp so instead of so sx  during the third trial  she constantly begs to be forgiven for everything and attempts to manipulate the others into doing so despite the acts she just committed  this seems like childish sp  entitlement  she also says   you accepted the past me  but not the current me    which reflects the desire of the countertype sp  to not be loved for the good they do  but for who they truly are  not to mention her tendencies to make herself look helpless  purposefully tripping and talking about being bullied  I can t see much sx  in her besides being a little intense  she s certainly not very seductive or focused on her appearance    which I don t mean just physically   I can see some so  in her though  she became a nurse because of the power she could have over her patients  she wants others to depend on her  so sp so   sp sx ,isfj
i apologize to those that remember my previous deleted comment  not the one in the topic section  tbh i found ISFJ hella obvious and my arguments were supposed to be similar to the previous ones it s just been a while since i ve played this game so i forgot how to explain Si aux and what my argument was really gonna be that when i read the ESFJ arguments i got more confused but now that people are giving those explanations for me i remember now and i made up my mind shes an ISFJ also its pretty ironic how we have three opposite letters yet i still kin her,isfj
i just dont see her with inferior Ti  I can see where people see ESFJ but IMO inf Ne makes more sense,isfj
  SPOILERS   I know her Fe is quite strong  but didn t her actions on chapter   class trial sounded more like Ne catastrophizing rather than Ti  Like  all of her  it s not fair  sounded more like a inferior Ne to me  even though she tried to rationalize the things that happened before so that others would stop accusing her of being the killer  couldn t that be a typical Fe manipulation  Or maybe even tertiary Ti  I guess  prob not but anyways   she s always seeing bad possibilities for the future  but I m not saying that this automatically means inf ne  ,isfj
Notice how ESFJ voters are more concerned about making fun of ISFJ voters rather than giving actual reasons as to why Mikan is ESFJ   ISFJ  Anyways  I see less Ne in her than Ti  Doing research on cognitive functions  Mikan has way less Ne traits than she does Ti ,isfj
I swear the ESFJ voters claim that we vote ISFJ because nurse but have they even read the comments  There is a lot of ISFJ explanations  And no way she has Ne Ti  You can even see her using Ti sometimes but her inferior Ne is painfully shown in series by how she is worried and anxious about possible future in such stereotypical way ,isfj
Guys cmon she is a dark memer ENTP just look at her,isfj
Ok guys  i could understand why more fe si  she is such an people pleaser  she wants social harmony  and yeah i do agree her personality has a lot of fe  But  its not that people are only voting ISFJ bcs shes a Nurse  Also  shes a very unhealthy person sometimes i feel like typing her mbti is no use tbh   Also  her ne is far more worse than ti  you could see a bit of ti in the trials  she rarely makes some logical conclusions i agree but i mean it was more prominent than ne  But fe si is a little difference tho    also even if shes a     w  makes more sense tbh and tbh  social   makes no sense lmao  i could see sp sx   if she ever were a   lmao  i only voted     bcs her enneagram is somethin with these numbers  btw the producers and directors did her dirty  she is bullied  abused and used for fanservice  i feel so bad for her ,isfj
ESFJ voters are really slacking rn lol  they re just making bold claims without any proof and saying  nurse   ISFJ  when they don t have anything valid to say ,isfj
My fav girl     I don t know     she is an ESFJ or ISFJ    lmao,isfj
Alright her mbti is so changeable so now I ll explain why she is a Fe dom more than a Si I believe that her Ne is too high to be an inferior plus the Ti really deserves to be an inferior cause ya know she isn t that much of a deep or a thoughtful person I don t really find any reason why Ti   Ne so if someone can explain this please reply to this post,isfj
I think that Mikan is still an ELFV  since her behavior is quite typical of the lower V   for example  suppressing her desires and indulging others  you can still think about its mbti type  but I  like most  tend to the ISFJ  although there is an ESFJ   with  w  and tritype I agree     ,isfj
Can at least one ESFJ voter give their reasoning on why they think that she s a Fe dom and not Si som instead of making fun of ISFJ voters who already gave a bunch of reasons for voting her as an ISFJ   why they think that she s not an ESFJ  Seriously  I can t find any arguments for her being an ESFJ  the only comments from ESFJ voters are  ISFJ when nurse ,isfj
ISFJ  Si  she talks so much about the past and the experiences that she had  Lots of her actions were relationated to her past experiences and she normally doesnt try new things  She breaks that in the murder but in the trial she doesn t have so much arguments  because she never experienced one so it was difficult for her having no direct referents   Fe  She has looots of fe but after the filter of si  She is really manipulative in the trial and tries to cry and saying she is not capable of doing x things  and in a first moment she really had the people at her side  She is good knowing how the people will feel   Inferior ne  she sees all the bad possible things in the future  and that makes her breakdown in trial  it s not fair     instead of going to rational arguments or changing the arguments constantly ,isfj
there are probably hundreds of comments consisting of  she s ISFJ bc nurse  jokes by now  i m not sure why ESFJ voters like to pretend there aren t any legitimate ISFJ arguments  people have been talking about how fe doms can be shy on this page for the past year  we re well aware social introversion is different from cognitive introversion  look at any of the popular ISFJ arguments and tell me if any of them consist of  she s too shy to be an ESFJ   i feel like a lot of people on this page are fighting an imaginary opponent  both sides have valid points  that s why this debate has been going on for so long  i m not trying to change anyone s mind  but just try to be mature and avoid strawmanning people you disagree with  it helps no one ,isfj
Just because she s an introvert doesn t mean she s an ISFJ,isfj
can someone explain why so sx to me  I m not too sure if I see the social two description fitting her at all  gen,isfj
shes an ISFJ because shes a nurse but like an INTJ at the same time because shes purple Argue with the wall,isfj
the moment y all learn the Social in big   is not based solely off of extroversion is going to be really funny,isfj
Why S over R in the Big     I agree with the remaining letters  but why not R   She doesn t really appear social or extroverted to me  In fact  I see Betty as someone who is very introverted and keeps to herself a lot ,isfj
  months later and she is an ISFJ now  Interesting ,isfj
she seems more reserved than social ,isfj
SLOAI  Since when is she extraverted  To me she always seemed like an introvert  so I am curious as to why she is SLOAI over RLOAI ,isfj
Betty Cooper   totalmente INFJ  aceitem amgs   ,isfj
No  you don t switch mbti types  She never switched between Si or Ni  because she s never had Ni in her function stack    I agree that Betty presents as a more  abstract  thinker than the typical ISFJs  but this is out of necessity  not necessarily her natural state of information processing  She is too meticulous  concrete  detailed  and aware of her surroundings and present compared to a high Ni user  Jung has specifically  and constantly pointed out the high Ni users disconnection from their environment and immediate reality  They re not immersed in the present details  and surely lack both the talent and motivation to constantly and skillfully manipulate it    Betty has showcased an extreme amount of unhealthy Ne usage  Being bombarded with alternative perspectives is a source of frustration  and big picture thinking is not her strong suit as the most cognitive influence is found in her Si     I am going to rewatch the series  as i ve been told Riverdale  grows on you   I doubt it   as we all know post Season   was absolutely horrid  However  maybe i ll change my mind after running some fresh eyes over the seasons   God i m watching this again and this Si is SO obvious  i ve never seen such a poster ISFJ ,isfj
where is her Ni   i never saw her as a Ni dom,isfj
So first  it was ENFJ and then it was INFJ and now people are         saying ISFJ  Stick to one personality type and not go around mistyping like bozos k thanks ,isfj
I think she s a fe dom  Why si ,isfj
 It made me so happy to hear how much he values me     I am here to serve in whatever capacity you require  You needn t be concerned about the way I feel    I  on the other hand  feel a strong sense of achievement every time I do something for you    I spend all my days handling the most trivial of matters  but so long as it helps you in your adventure  or makes your life easier in some small way  I couldn t be happier  That s because each time I get a thank you  it makes me feel like my work at least has some meaning  no matter how insignificant it seems    so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval  it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far    To me  I can see both   and   in her  at least in these lines  Everything she does is for acknowledgment and praise like  s or because she wants to feel valued like  s  I m leaning towards her being  w  rather than  w  because of her interaction with that one kid in her second hangout event but yessss,isfj
Imo it seems her ti is worse than ne,isfj
Selfishly I want to keep her as a  w   but it is fun to watch her enneagram be debated   My only counterclaim towards making her anything other than   is that all her work and giving towards the knights is so that she may be accepted into their ranks  right  This aligns perfectly with the behaviors of a    giving to get  A lot of twos will simply give because they genuinely want to  however  seducing via gift giving or acts of service in order to receive something in return is the definition of a    I d be happy to discuss it more  since I m not super sure in my logic ,isfj
look i def see lots of si in her but i think fe is her dom  id like to hear everyones arguments tho,isfj
website  https   www personalitycafe com threads social nines according to beatrice chestnut           Social Nines express the passion of psychological laziness  or sloth  through merging with the group  working hard in support of group interests  and prioritizing the group s needs above their own  Social Nines are congenial characters with a need to feel like they re a part of things a need that expresses an underlying feeling of being different or not fitting in with the group or community  This person is a light hearted  sociable  fun loving character who expresses a driving need to be involved in the group   The Social Nine s need to participate comes from their deeper feeling of not belonging to the group  This feeling drives the Social Nine to overcompensate by being generous and sacrificing whatever is necessary to meet the needs of the group as a way of earning membership  They have an intense need to feel that they are a part of things  because they don t feel that they are  They feel like they have to do something extra in order to be included in a group  so they work twice as hard to support the group to make sure they belong   Social Nines have a passion for doing what is necessary to pay the ticket for group admission  for being one with that group but it takes a lot of effort  Social Nines can be workaholics  they feel a need to work hard and give a lot  But it s not just work they energetically demonstrate friendliness and sociability  they don t show their pain  they don t burden others  and they don t show people how much energy it takes to devote so much effort to the community  These are people who are generous and unselfish  mindful of the group  and gifted in meeting the needs of others to the point where they sacrifice themselves to satisfy the responsibility others want to put on them   In contrast to the other two Nine Subtypes  who tend to be more subdued characters  Social Nines are very outgoing and energetic this is what makes this the counter type Nine  Social Nines have a special brand of strength because they feel motivated to fight for the needs of the group  Social Nines are extroverted  expressive  and forceful  and so they go against the inertia typical of Type Nine in some ways but on the inside they still have a sense of laziness about their own needs and wants   Social Nines make very good leaders the best kind of leaders  in fact in the sense that they are good  unselfish people who strive to satisfy the responsibility given them  They can be especially gifted mediators  they naturally want to translate differing opinions so that everyone is heard and conflict in the group is avoided  They put a lot of energy into their work as a leader  They have an ability to bear a lot  sometimes to the extent that they become a  human punching bag   These Nines give of themselves unconditionally as a response to a deeper  sometimes unconscious  fear of abandonment  conflict  separation  and the potential loss of peace and harmony   Social Nines like to control things  and they like to talk a lot  Because they work so hard for the group  they may have no time left for themselves  They tend to have very full lives full of everything but themselves  And while Social Nines get their identity and their sense of reality form belonging  they often doubt their own existence  their own sense of self   The outward expression of this subtype is more happy than sad  but theirs may ultimately be a kind of partial participation  underneath their cheerful exterior  their sense of not belonging persists and creates a kind of sadness that isn t communicated to others  They don t feel their suffering very much but they don t feel extreme  euphoric highs  either  They are more in the middle emotionally neither hot nor cold and they may be somewhat detached from their emotions and sensations   Social Nines can look like Type Threes because they work very hard and accomplish a lot without showing the stress of it  But they differ from Threes in that they are much more reluctant to be in the spotlight and they don t support the group to create an image or to win admiration from others  They may also be mistaken for Twos because they are active in meeting the needs of others  but they have much less need for approval and appreciation than Twos  and are generally more emotionally steady ,isfj
how about this yall   website  https   www enneagramcentral com Enneagram Subtypes Subtype   One   Self   Preservation htm Self preservation Ones are really hard to distinguish from Sixes because both worry a lot  Ones of this persuasion take their generalized critical attitude and decide they aren t going to be able to live up to the right way of doing things  But of course they don t do this in one fell swoop  They begin to worry about every little thing  especially decisions  because decisions are a function of the will  and it is the will that gets angry  Anger gets a quarter turn when focused on oneself for Ones  The  one right way  that Ones are troubled with turns into a concern that one wrong move could knock down the whole house of cards  The thin line between thinking things are not right and that the world is not going to work is a fine one  For this reason  they may love routine and will cling unreasonably to it  And once plans are made and the inner work of making a decision has been done  it is very difficult to change a plan  From the outside they can look like a Five or Six because they anticipate everything than can go wrong and can make detailed plans  ONE VS  SIX One difference between the worry and the almost paranoia of the One and the Six is that the Six can feel righteous and they know they don t deserve to have the world turned against them  Self preservation Ones are not so sure    sometimes  There can often be an element of being undeserving and inadequate  so they react with worry  After all  they think  if there is only one right way to do and be  I probably haven t found it    the odds are against me  But Ones work tremendously hard to try to reach that one right way   To tighten the focus even more  this whole worry reaches it zenith when it comes to material well being  Job security  money  health  and work ethic are big  The thought of undeserving people getting welfare is enough to ruin their whole day  whereas a Social One  like Ralph Nadar will worry about corporate welfare ,isfj
shes so clealy ENTP  her little act all a front  how can you not tell  its SO her Fe aux,isfj
I don t see how Noelle is a Social     Going based on Beatrice Chestnut s descriptions   The Social Six is also a bit of a legalistic character  they have the mind of a lawgiver  and they like clear categories  Culturally  the Germans provide a good example of this archetype in that they like precision  order  and efficiency  Social Sixes have a strong sense of duty  they idealize authority  and they display a generalized dutifulness an obedience to law  a devotion to fulfilling responsibilities as defined by external authority  a tendency to follow rules and to value documents and institutions  and a kind of rigidity and organization     Naranjo s descriptions   This is precisely the complete opposite of the six conservation  which is warm and feels too permissive for ambiguity    this is the line  the party line  the line that defines which are the good guys and which are the bad guys    and what we need to do and we do it very efficiently     From what I remember during her  st hangout  Noelle is very warm and open minded when it comes to accommodating everyone  including that one very obviously suspicious guy  and while she knows full well that he could have malicious intent  she still decides to give him a proper greeting and tour around Mondstadt and even goes so far as to twist the Knights  rules to do so  IF she is a   core  which I doubt but I don t have a proper refute  hence my blank enneatype vote   the warmer Self Preservation   fits her more  An actual Social   would be more like Kujou Sara who is compliant to the Shogun s ideology  is more rigid  and has a more black and white view compared to Noelle  Another possible SO  is Xiao but that s a discussion for another day ,isfj

can someone explain why mel dom over mel phleg  although jean is well organized and analytical  she also has a calmer side to herself where she is active in her environment as the acting grand master and has a pretty peaceful demeanor   The Melancholy Phlegmatic is a pleasant and accommodating person who tends to seek a structured environment requiring attention to detail  They have a self sacrificing  self critical nature  and struggle with guilt feelings about things that are not often their fault      this fits jean as her role as the acting grand master in the knights of favonius  she always does her best to defend the people of mondstadt despite being sick and worries about if she s good enough for her role as the acting grand master  in her story quest she felt burned out due to the pressure of trying to uphold everyone s needs and felt guilty for resting despite her illness    here s a link for the description of mel phleg and i find that it suits her better than mel dom  maybe later i ll try to give a better explanation but right now  i m just waiting on what you guys think ,isfj

why are people suddenly questioning jean s type  i thought it was extremely obvious that she was an ISFJ  idk about you but i can t see Jean as an Fe dom at all  i can t see her using Fi at all either  all her struggles have to do with Si Fe and her story quest really showcased it i guess it s confusing for some because she s the grand master and basically the leader of Mondstadt  so she may seem like she uses Te to an extent  but really it s just her enneagram that makes it seem that way,isfj

if ur in between INFP and ISFJ  why not ESFJ   actually anyone can avoid conflict LMAO,isfj
LOL  somebody actually voted ENTJ    I would say INFP or ISFJ  Probably both ,isfj
did you guys  the ones who always stop avoid conflicts  realize that conflict can be a healthy thing  and avoiding stopping a conflict can make the situation worse    holding emotions back is definitely more unhealthy than getting angry mad at someone once and finally being able to move on because you got those emotions out  I m  of course  not saying that we should always get into conflicts  but the calm discussion isn t always the way to go  I find it pretty immature to avoid conflicts at all costs  Especially since it causes a lot of passive aggressive stuff  that s how you get into toxic behaviors   ,isfj

while ISFJs do not like conflict  it s not because they are pushovers  once it s time to fight  they will and you will be surprised    also ISFJs strongly believe certain rules  objective ethics  and if you go against those rules they will act  this is why keirsey categorize them under the  guardians  as  protectors   https   keirsey com temperament guardian protector ,isfj

can anyone just reply with their arguments for either INFJ or ISFJ  i m not on either side cause so far i really haven t seen good arguments for either  but he s definitely IXFJ so any arguments from either side would help greatly   eiji s a tough one to type lolol  also  keep it civil  it s just a fictional character s mbti  it s not the end of the world  we ll all be okay ,isfj
Eiji is a clear ISFJ  he can be confused with other personalities because of his high Fe and how he manifests  being from Enneagram   and being a clear dominant phlegmatic  his Fe can even give him a Fi aspect  making them think he might be an INFP  or that he s an INFJ of    But make no mistake  whoever read the manga and watched the show gets to see the Si of Eiji  and how it constantly works on a Si Fe axis    Eiji was an accomplished pole vaulter before an injury occurred and he was forced to retire from the sport  It was part of the reason Shunichi Ibe decided to bring him to New York with him  It is known that Eiji was a highly accomplished pole vaulter and was offered numerous sports scholarships because of this  Eiji have had a normal life until the events of Banana Fish took place   ISFJ s naturally use Si to catalogue experiences and information they deem important  They have an organized internal world and their mind can easily put similar pieces of information into appropriate categories  They learn straightforward  practical systems  rules  and strategies with ease and grace  what can make them excellent students  good citizens and dedicated workers  The ISFJ can change if there is a valuable reason or a clear plan  Eiji would probably never have gone to New York if he hadn t suffered the fracture  he would have continued his normal life in Japan     He is quite perceptive and very aware of his surroundings  one situation being when Eiji knew instantly when Ash was lying to him  because of his terrifying calmness  Usually  he is an understanding  reasonable person  but can have unwavering stubbornness and can even be moderately rude when prompted  Eiji s kind and innocent nature can be calming to those around him  most notably Ash   Here we have another Si Fe characteristic of Enneagram    Si is an introverted perceiving function  more analytical and more specific  quicker to spot inconsistencies and or what s missing  Si combined with Fe is great for dealing with people  comparing past facts  analyzing expressions and noticing details   Eiji has a very kind and selfless personality who is also inquisitive about things unfamiliar to him such as Ash Lynx s gun   Inferior Function  Extraverted Intuition   As the series progresses  he starts depending on Ash  Eiji has  on more than one occasion  been described as innocent  but brave   Si Fe   To Skipper   Ash   If I m going to die anyways  at least I ll die trying   Si Fe  We can also notice a lot of Enneagram   in Eiji  Eiji has a lot of high Fe characteristics  but I don t see this character as a dominant Ni or an INFP  because if you take other characters of these types and compare  you can clearly see the Si Fe axes difference  Ni Fe and Fi Ne  and I see a lot more Si Fe in Eiji  especially if you read Garden of Light,isfj
to me he seemed more Si inclined in first episodes but the last ones showed more ni    He could see a brighter future for both ash and him despite ash being rooted to NY mafia    He started to understand more about ash s actions  I guess you could relate it to understanding hidden meanings  although it could be Fe aux    On the other hand he wasn t able to put himself in ash s shoes when killing people because he wasn t as down to earth as ash was  obviously eiji didn t live as traumatizing experiences as ash did  but my point is that he always seemed to see a pacifier way of resolving things instead of having his mind grounded     His advice when predicting Foxx s strategy seemed Ni to me     I could relate to his method  I know this isn t a valid point  more of a subjective one but I added it since I m just judging from what I perceived    I ve read some comments pointing Si Dom at the jumping thing and how he couldn t do it  yut lung  inxj  couldn t let go his past and all his personality is based on that      Se inferior maybe in how bad he was when shooting everything physically related As a general and subjective judgment  as a Ni dom I couldn t relate that much to him  I find him kind of insufferable and boring for the most part of the anime  which inclined my vote more to Si Dom but I won t be voting,isfj
Why  w   I m genuinely wondering does he even fit that  Or is it a stereotype   I can lowkey see   core tbh  Explain  And besides   would make sense cause they integrate into  ,isfj
Boo reposting updating my argument and more cohesive   Inferior Ne causes people to not be willing to accept much change  possibilities  and more than one rout  like to stick with what they know based on sensory images  Eiji does not relate or struggle with this  it just isn t in his function stack  One  is the fact that he IS willing to comprehend and think outside of the box  He is more abstract than concrete  if using those terms  Rapidly relating to the past is a Si characteristic and nowhere in the show does this happen  excluding the pole vaulting scene  The pole vaulting scene is literally ONE situation that occurred in a life threatening situation  At that point anyone is able to think of anything at the desperate point he was  To an extent could be qualified of Ni  he was able to take in all the different possibilities in real time and apply them to one idea and solution  Most of eijis decisions are made like this on a whim  not really relating to the past but more like combining possibilities into one solid idea  That s Ni at it s finest  NiFe or NiTi does work in a way that is sort of like a filter  pushing in certain ideas from the OUTSIDE world  and then using both path  present  and future knowledge to sort of  compromise   In addition  he s very much focused on what will happen rather than WHY this will happen  His ability to predict what Ash does can be known as Ni  He picks up context clues and filters them like above   i can tell that you re lying  because whenever you lie  you become terribly calm  you re hiding something important   Pure Ni  IF THIS HAPPENS  THEN THIS WILL HAPPEN  If ash acts like this then this will happen     Another reason of Ni  Security  Staying in NY even though past experiences taught him not to take risks  and even though Ibe and others tell him it s not worth it  he stays   Inferior Se  Inferior Se acts in many ways  So does Ne   Ne   Fear of change  unknown  stress about possibilities  Se   Oblivious to sensations  inattentive to details and both internal and external  uncaring about things in the environment and inner world focus  For example  Ne even when healthy sticks to one path whenever possible  whereas eiji actually moved towards it  He takes risks  He stays with the dangers and unknown   When unhealthy Se manifests it causes people to ignore their own healthily needs and causes them to jump into danger sometimes unknowingly   Eiji doesn t focus on the environment like ash does  who uses Se actively  Ash applies sensations from the outside world and environments to make decisions  He is overly observant and uses that to his advantage often  For Eiji it is the opposite as he doesn t care  he simply doesn t about the external world as much as the internal    The inferior function is not the one we don t use  it s the one we use to support or dominant function  It s the one we use but it s weaker than the rest  When eiji is in danger he uses his Se  which  stated above  isn t that strong  causes him to come across as reckless and impulsive  and ignores his dominant which helps him foresee issues     Now why is he not INFP  Simple  Fi is not there  Neither is Ne Si  Or Te  Well  let s start with rebutting Fi  Fi and Fe are similar in the fact that they both have morals  but Fi drives their morals from their own internal world and Fe gets it from the external world  In eijis case it s clear that what he believes in comes from the external things that he faces  His priority of others over first is clear too  Plus Fe Ti axis is fairly obvious  as well   Yea thanks for coming to my TEDTalk,isfj
why are people acting like Ni users cant learn from their past as well   but the pole vaulting sce   just because he used to pole vault and used it there  it doesnt mean he cant be intuitive  that could also just be his Se because of how much pressure he was in since he literally just does NOT have the time to really think  He gets so upset when things dont go as he planned  he s always coming up with his personal ideas and definitely focuses more on the now and future instead of his past  I have not read the manga yet though  but from what i know from it  it does seem like he uses a lot of Si in his timeskip from how he cant just move on  im still pretty torn apart between ISFJ and INFJ  so if you have a buch of examples where he uses Si  i d love to hear them and really try to understand more ,isfj
i think any decision could be wrote as impulsive   usage of se inf because of the overal show  a lot of decisions had to be made in a very short amount of time  so i don t think that we get a really good insight towards how he makes decisions  usually ni doms are very easy to spot    i don t see a ton of ni in him  so i m leaning ISFJ   ,isfj
The truth is that Eiji doesn t show either Si or Ni   actually his taste for being useful  for routine tasks and practical help demonstrates his Si well  then it s hard to define his type  ISFJ voters don t have much Arguments for Si and Arguments for Ni are ridiculous  People say  they don t have an argument for Si  so he s INFJ  What kind of Argument is this  Okay  he doesn t demonstrate Si  but does he demonstrate Ni  If so  tell me where because I didn t really see the slightest sign of it  I only vote ISFJ because Eiji hasn t shown any interest in hidden meanings  hidden connections or signs between things  Eiji is not a person who questions himself  we rarely see him questioning himself or looking for something beyond what he sees  Ni is about theories  it s about looking at an object and drawing a parallel between the object and the user  A Ni user will look at a faded rainbow flag on an abandoned house and think  the person who lived here must be LGBT   having Ni is making connections about things that seem obvious  And Eiji doesn t have any of that  But cognitively speaking the worst fear of an ISFJ is not being useful to the people they care about  and this fear was demonstrated by Eiji During the Anime when he thought he was hindering Ash He felt useless  and someone unpleasant  and felt an incredible urge to prove himself useful and help Ash  INFJs are not so much in reality  Eiji seems not have problems with it  What is the biggest fear of an INFJ  Living a mundane  meaningless life  being forced to do simple  mundane tasks for the rest of your life  That s because INFJs have Si Demon  an INFJ wouldn t be able to live long as a  Householder  for example  Now Eiji lives well with that in fact that s all he wants  a calm  simple and peaceful life where he s just a  house owner   he likes it  This already demonstrates that it is very difficult for him to be an INFJ  because the taste for routine things  like cooking  or tidying up the house is a taste of Si And an INFJ don t have it  Before I say  but that s just stereotype     No  it s not  that s cognitive behavior  and that s what I m basing myself on  Stereotype would be if I said he s ISFJ because he s too passive  and that s not even the case  But it s just my opinion  it s okay not to agree with it    Each one has the right to their own position  just do it without offending anyone  And try to make your arguments make sense  does a Character not having Si make him have Ni automatically  No  they say there are no Arguments for Si but they can t find any for Ni either,isfj
The idea that Sawako cannot be INTP  because she puts others ahead of her  seems tragicomic to me  It doesn t surprise me that several INTPs end up being nihilists  lose faith in romance  and some even deny who they were  which hurt them so much  With this quality of understanding of others it is not surprising that several INTPs end up being cynical and loathe the idea of being one more   The very idea that INTPs are these feelingless robots that just think as if their minds were some kind of computer is so funny  it s a stereotype  something believed by those who don t know what an INTP is  I really wonder if someone who is so confident in the idea that Sawako is not an INTP even read the manga   I m feeling pitch black  I feel like I m being burned by the red flames of jealousy and the black flames of self hatered right now   Do you know why that phrase is not familiar to some of you  because it was not in the anime  the manga has more than triple the content of what the anime showed  I really doubt that whoever dismisses the idea of Sawako being an INTP so quickly has read the original material and is just looking at the character in a superficial way    Sawako thinks much more than some give her credit  doubts her own ideas and analyzes her behavior from an intellectual point of view  She transforms her feelings into poetic phrases  add that extra in her wishes and dreams because it is a combination of what she thinks with her mind and feels with her heart    Sawako also wants to be a literature teacher because she is inspired by her teacher who could have been a professional baseball player but rejected that life for something that gives him satisfaction that few would understand  Some would go for social security  others for money and fame  some want to get married and have children but Sawako asks herself why her teacher has no regrets when he turns down a dream job    When she analyzes that situation  she realizes that there are things that one can do without fear of being wrong  that intellectual and emotional maturity makes Sawako dare not to settle for a predictable ending  She does not seek social security  an ideal fairy tale story  She looks for a reason within herself to be content with what she wants her to do with her life  not to regret it  to finally achieve what they call happiness  That analytical  abstract way of thinking is what makes her discover this new desire  That is why Sawako understands her teacher in a profound way and despite the fact that no one respects the teacher  Sawako considers him someone exemplary    The mere idea that Sawako doesn t think  that she just feels and wants to be loved is so superficial  To analyze a character like her you have to do much more than just take what you think you know and read the original material in its entirety   Sawako way of loving is complex  her actions have a very deep reason  she constantly thinks the multiple conclusions  To think that her extreme abstract way of seeing love is something that someone simple would be able to create is comical  Summarizing one of the most profound  philosophical and complex characters as  she knows how to use her feelings  She wants to be a girlfriend  is comical    INTPs are not feelingless robots where they are all computer engineers or have studied science  Those thoughts so pure and feelings so wild are what sometimes make them lose their love for loving  Because in a world where no one gives you back what you give  one learns never to give again  That stereotype of INTPs who would never do something for someone else  who always think in a calculating way is the stereotype that I detest the most    If some of you knew how romantic  poetic and self sacrificing some INTPs are  you would realize what I see so clearly ,isfj
I don t understand why they keep saying she is INTP  I read several arguments and none convinced me  People say things like   She doesn t know how to Fe her faith   Like this  She uses her Fe often  Sawako is always putting others  needs ahead of hers  and the slightest response to her kindness  she s already happy  She knows how to use Fe as well as more episodes of the show  but the real problem is that people still don t like her the same way  because she seems  weird  and  scary   Sawako uses her Fe several times  and there are examples in this profile  It s not like she doesn t know how to Fe  Also  Ti dom  I think it would make more sense for her to be a little shorter  Ti dom questions things like  why    it can be done    this is because of a   b    a plus b makes c    could it be done this way   She doesn t normally ask herself these questions  What would suit Sawako the most would be   It s always been like this  why would it be different now tomorrow     I ve always known that and I don t think it will ever change  Si Ne    Good thing she always tries to make an effort to change that     Ti terc  Values independent thought and action    Analyzes situations critically and patiently    Responsible for personal failures or errors    Accepts comments and criticism well    Clear understanding of relationship responsibilities and establishing appropriate boundaries between yourself and others   This sounds a lot like it  of course the tertiary role is an evolving role  so this situation shouldn t be taken too literally  It s my perspective   Sorry if there was any error  I m using the translator    There s a comment here that I thought was very good  if you didn t see it  here it is   Avice im just impressed you were this confident in your opinion based on   episodes of a   season show   I lowkey respect that  though I still disagree with you I think it becomes clearer that shes ISFJ the further on it goes but even early on  how would you explain an INTP being completely willing to change her how she presented in order to be accepted   the amount of effort she puts into learning about horror ghost stories just to please others is also a reason why INFP is completely out  since she doesnt care about authenticity at all   And even what youre talking about with her misreading situations  if you think about it  as an Si dom she would rely on past experience to guide her through the present  which would explain how she had such difficulty navigating the situation since shes literally never had friends before  She took in the emotions from the external atmosphere  fairly accurately I might add  and judged the situation on that  followed by trying to find an explanation for why they were acting that way  her Ti was what was inaccurate  and her not considering alternatives was her weakness in that scene  not her misreading of their emotions  Not to mention she completely relies on external support validation which for an INTP wouldnt be as much of a priority While personally I dont like how some people in this comment section act like INTPs dont care about what others think of them or want to be included  they are definately still much more comfortable existing on their own without being accepted in a group  while the high Fe will naturally pull an ISFJ to want to be accepted and liked by groups  or to do things in service of it as Sawako does since their primary judging function is based on the collective values   group   self Also what youre saying about  not thinking about how others felt  is kind of off  she was thinking about how others felt and it was entirely based on that that she distanced herself  just that shes completely stuck on what shes experienced in the past and has trouble being open to the idea of things being different  which is her dom Si inf Ne   Shes always been treated as a nuiscance that people feel they would be happier without and so its based on that experience that her low self esteem assumes they wouldnt feel upset about her distancing herself from them  I personally think an INTP could come to this conclusion too but I wanted to give my interpretation of that for her anyway since you havent even finished the source material before making a comment  I assume you havent read the other arguments here either so I recommend you do once you finish the show  even if they dont change your mind ,isfj
Based off the arguments for INTP i can see her as one but i can also see her as an ISFJ but i feel like she may be a little more difficult to type because she s neurodivergent coded I m pretty sure,isfj
Well time to teach a few things  apparently they don t understand  Ask yourself what is the main characteristic of Sawako  She s kind  is she innocent  She is sweet  none of the above  the main characteristic of her is that she does not find value in herself  Because of this  she does not believe she deserves love or friendship  why should someone worthless be appreciated  clear evidence of lack of FI  Because Sawako has no feelings for herself she takes the opinions of others as a form of her identity  Sawako is scary  so it must be her fault  Sawako has no friends  it must be because she never speaks  Sawako is the problem  she must change  she did something wrong   The anime creates a contrast with her lack of self esteem with the desire to love  because someone approaches her naturally and treats her well Sawako stops being afraid of being rejected and begins to wish for a better future  This is where her Fe manifests itself  Sawako is a kind and considerate person to the point that this is a disadvantage for her  because of her immaturity and easy to manipulate heart she gets into trouble  She puts others ahead of herself  she shouldn t talk to him because he wants to be alone  she shouldn t look for him because he sure doesn t want to see me  She lives in a world of infinite logical conclusions but that do not exist in reality  in Sawako s reality nothing ends because nothing begins for fear of failure to end in one of the conclusions that she already thought  She is consumed by her fears and fear is what kills the mind  Then she represses her feelings  for the common good and to save future suffering   Sawako is not carried away by her feelings anymore  everything that she observes or discovers is analyzed by her mind and she tries to make everything make sense  as if she is analyzing the chances that she has to achieve success  before even trying  Due to over analyzing the different conclusions of her love story  she does not want to confess  but by not doing so  her romantic interest moves away from her more and more  That is why the show is called Kimi ni Todoke  I want you to realize my love for you    People believe that the title is because Sawako should confess and make her romantic interest understand that she loves him  When in fact it is the opposite  the title is from Kazehaya to Sawako  so that she understands that she has value for herself and that she should look within to understand what she is worth  She must learn to value herself before being able to value someone else  only then can she love freely without fear of being rejected and thus be able to stop analyzing the multiple conclusions  because eventually if she is true to herself she will get to where she has to arrive  That s why the last scene is Sawako catching up with Kazehaya  because she finally understood that to love she only needs to love   The over analysis  the social ineptitude  the desires that are uncontrollable and the doubts of herself plus the lack of value that she sees in herself are clear proof that Sawako is INTP  Sawako has to learn that romanticism is the victory of feelings over the mind and thus to be free  to be free to love being who she is ,isfj
I really think if she was a boy she would ve been typed something else   At least ISFJ makes more sense than INFP    I just cannot see Auxiliary Fe whatsoever even the comments that claim she has it don t hold any weight because her entire issue is she has Fe and cannot appropriately exert it into her behavior    Lovely show and she s a very cute and quirky character ,isfj
Honestly i always viewed her as an INFJ or ISFJ  INFJs in general seems a little more assertive or  chamelion like using their Fe  while she is being a literal cupcake  She definetely puts so much value in her Fe  In one of the episodes  i remember her saying she understands why other people doesnt understand the study material and she was so good at explaining them one by one in order to their understanding  Seems like Fe to me  And she made cookies for her friends for Christmas  it was so cute i tried to do that too but not my cup of tea  She uses her Fe so naturally and sincerely  I love her     I think a    year old INTP would be a little insecure about being a total outcast or a left out  So they would just try to be in harmony with others in a healthy but minimum level  While Kuronuma is being a total outcast just for the sake of social harmony  she is totaly selfless  ,isfj
at first  i thought she was a  healthy  INTP  w  but then i realized  shes a teen and INTP has inferior Fe  not really developed in younger years    her Fe is high enough for an aux  she also uses her Ti but i dont think it s as high as a Ti dom ,isfj
so u ppl have no problem taking her to INTP nd then ISFJ but never admitted INFP smh IXFJs know how to express and don t seek ultimate expression or connection  instead they seek genuinity  sincerity  truth because they lack it to some extent as they keep compromising it for the group  whereas INFPs know how to be genuine sincere and innocent but end up loosing expression and become misunderstood because of that  ofcourse a type isn t just genuine because of its functions but can t overlook Fi as the main function of authenticity  hence INFPs consciously seek expression and connection  be it in art  music whatever  the core is self expression always for INFPs as for IXFJs its some message or truth,isfj
Ah  my favourite type  Si Ne Si Ne  This profile has gone on a wild journey  at least the consensus has always been consistent for Si Ne axis lol,isfj
she is such a INTP like im only on episode   but her main issue is her Fe  she sucks at expressing herself she sucks at reading the situation and she WANTS to have close friends and that stuff  all people suck at their demon and want it the same time  An ISFJ would have an immensely better grasp at Fe than her   one of the issues so far was that she started separating herself from others because she THOUGHT that their lives would worsen w o her  from big picture like the dude would lose popularity the girls had rumors spreading etc  so basically using her Ti and Ne  Ti   thinking about the problem  Ne   making the connection conclusion that they would be better w o her  she distanced herself  I think an ISFJ would gather the facts first  rather than jumping to huge conclusions  and an INFP would be more in touch with the emotional vibe and thinking abt how others would feel about some decision  like she never thought about how the dude and   girls felt   def demon Fe if u ask me   it even said in the show that she was thinking too logically about the situation   an ISFJ would have a balanced decision maker  bc their Ti and Fe are relatively balanced  whereas an INTP would overindulge in their Ti not even thinking about how the others felt  Fe   she          an INTP,isfj
my school used this website for a project and it typed ALMOST EVERYONE WRONG  should i send an email to the school saying we shouldn t use the website ,isfj
The problem with   p is that they disguise themselves as an MBTI site with the i e n s t f p j but it doesn t use cognitive functions and even then barely letter types it letter types based off of another theory of the big   personalities but guise it as MBTI which would be fine but even as a big   quiz it would be terrible from the fact all the questions are still bad  In conclusion don t use   personalities id rate it      points for the cute avatars cause I love them Jane  f ENTP  is an icon,isfj
I absolutely love reading everyone s comments trash talking   personalities  It s so satisfying,isfj
This thing typed me as a INFP  INTP  INFJ and ENFP  ,isfj
Besides the famous mistypes  I ve noticed that a lot of ESFJs mistype as ENFP ,isfj
i got misstyped as ISTP,isfj
This test typed me INFP  ISFP  ISTP  ESTP  ENTP  INTP  ENFP basically besides ESFP they typed me ALL P types and I m oh so ready for my future ESFP result   ,isfj
Logical Pdb for each type    Are you sad and cry for everything   INFP   Are you a pothead who loves nature   ENFP    Are you different from other people    INFJ   Is your only function to help people    ENFJ   Are you an evil emo genius    INTJ   Are you a nerd and haven t seen the light of day in months    INTP   You have no feelings and are probably a psychopath    ENTJ   Are you a kind of devil who doesn t know how to shut up    ENTP   Are you a mother    ISFJ   Are you boring and inflexible    ISTJ   Are you bossy    ESTJ   Are you popular    ESFJ   Are you cool and don t think before acting    ESTP   Are you a mechanic    ISTP   Are you a sensitive artist    ISFP   Are you addicted to parties    ESFP   Based on description of types and questions on   personalities com ,isfj
Thank you   p for single handedly ruining MBTI,isfj
this website made me believe i was an ENFP FOR FOUR YEARS ok when i learnt about cognitive functions i did realise there was something wrong but my si aux did not let me accept any changes for some time,isfj
ISFJ might be kind but they re cold as hell  j,isfj
i always come back to this one and every time i think a new type is the cutest  honestly you all are so cute in your own way i can t choose   ,isfj
ENFP and INFP,isfj
SEIs my beloved,isfj
i think ISFJs are really adorable,isfj
If you get to know them well enough  you ll find them all lovely,isfj
I m kinda flattered guys thanks    But seriously I really love ENTJs ,isfj
I love  appreciate  admire  adore  passionately follow  devote my life to  and I am fond of ISFJ s  ya ll are my cuties and I will do anything for you,isfj
Self Preservation   ,isfj
I know this one ESTJ who always is helping me when i need it  He s very closed to others  shy  not so social and full of anxiety inside of him but he s a great man and have big gold heart  LOVE him very much ,isfj
ESFJs are underrated  ISFJs are ok And im not a fan of xsfjs,isfj
Lots of SJs have a salty sweet sense of humor  the uncannily observant wit of Si  with a healthy dose of candy hued wildness from Ne    Overall  I enjoy the particular way SJs can draw humor from everyday life ,isfj
My beloved si doms  ,isfj
I love Fe doms  That s it ,isfj
Can t pick  love them all sorry,isfj
technically sei is an sp type,isfj
love em,isfj
ESFJ and ISTJ     ,isfj
i dont wanna be selfish again and also tbh i like ISTJ s and ESTJ s more than my own type ISFJ  also ty for the xSFJ love here  this makes me happy bcs of me self criticizing  shaming and being too harsh on myself ,isfj
The way her FE Ti was showed is pretty funny IMAO,isfj
cady  yeah  i like math  damian  ew   why  cady  because it s the same in every country ,isfj
 w   Why not  w   She helps Janis and Dameon to tell that all the crap she says      She tries and becomes a mean girl    ,isfj
Friendly  outgoing and cheerful  Not especially self conscious or impulsive  Very self confident  Fairly agreeable at the start and the end but becomes very vain and conceited in the middle  No indication of adventurousness or artistic interest  She s a very middle of the road character with mostly moderate traits ,isfj
FEVL obviously   V over  L,isfj
i can see why people might think she s an Fe dom  but the whole movie is her hating high school because it isn t like  her home in Africa   By the way  the fact that she refers to her home as the ENTIRE continent of Africa is so funny     Wanna come to my house in Asia    I miss my small town of Europe        God  I m so homesick for South America    ,isfj
There s something very very wrong about a major ESFJ argument  The ability to spew out random stuff in order to bulls it yourself out of a situation  is an ability  It s not cognitive preference  Just because someone is  able  to say weird stuff in order to get out of a situation  doesn t mean that s how that person faces the external world  You can learn to say random stuff  you can adapt to bullshitting yourself out of situations especially due to your parents  you can basically just gain the ability to lie efficiently  That doesn t mean Cady uses Ne  which is a function that has to do with rejecting the subjective internalized reality and the context  in favor of discovering more possibilities  Cady faces everything with her set understanding of the world and implements her new understandings of things as she learns to adapt to them in a gradual manner  Saying that the ability to say random stuff makes her a higher Ne user  just sticks the label on ISFJ s that they can t be imaginative  practical and can t learn to say something random ,isfj
non curious   I see cady as RCOAI but would love to hear others  opinions  ,isfj
Si dom  Someone explain  I saw Fe Si ,isfj
I love her so much,isfj
she s so crazyyyy love her,isfj
god the only person in my family who actually understands me in such a powerful emotional way  ily abuelita ,isfj
geez i can t stand her  very close minded and zero sp  all she think is about my parents feeling not myself  ,isfj
Im so proud of myself  I found her mbti even though she died before I was born      my mum told me about her  so I thought she was very much like an ISFJ so I presented the ISFJ profile to my mum and she totally approved      ,isfj
Shes so nice    ,isfj
why does everyone else get nice grandmas  ,isfj
My grandmother is someone who like my mother always complains about my obligations  it only changes that I can talk to my grandmother more  she is someone very nice  she usually tells me stories of her life the strangest ones catch my attention  as they are quite curious  She already said she saw a werewolf and then there was a whole mess that she and her group managed to get into house and the dog that took care of the outside simply had only the bones until today I don t know if it s true but it sure is very curious   There s another story that she saw a guy eating a live and raw frog  this one was pretty disgusting but it s pretty curious too ,isfj
I m quite sure about her  I really love her and I help her when I can  but she s been rude in some difficult family situations  which led to some quarrels and made suffer my mother and my aunt for different reasons  She could be better  but she s generally really caring with her family  almost always open to help who s next to her or at doing charity acts because of religion ,isfj
BUT SHE IS VERY SWEET,isfj
We hang out in our own little Classical Music Anxiety Corner  during Thanksgiving dinner,isfj
she is the best i live her with all my heart,isfj
insuportavel pra car lho,isfj
I initially thought she was an ESTJ  but her Ne is not as developed as an ESTJ  Then  I thought maybe ISFJ  but my grandmother had neither Fe nor Ti  So my closest answer is she s an ISTJ For some reason  in my family  she is the most annoying person for me ,isfj
the purest person in our family of arrogant bastards,isfj
she ruined my sanity lol  ,isfj
she s just so nice and understanding,isfj
Almost everyone in my family hates her except for me she s my favourite among my grandparents  ,isfj
Not sure if she s an extremely unhealthy   or just a   disintegrating into   when she s around me  She acts so differently with me than she used to act for my mom  from what I know    I think  w  makes sense for her  and I really think undeveloped inf Fe is something as well  mom always says she s unable to stay in any social group  Maybe that s autism tho  but INTP seems like the most obvious type for her  I d even say that she s a bit stereotypical of that type ,isfj
Her Fi is so obvious  ,isfj
she s actually my great grandma  but a definite ESFJ  w     my grandma is probably an extremely extremely unhealthy sx sp  w   maybe ISFJ ,isfj
She s incredibly talkative  even at her old age  She s always asking how you re feeling  Such a sweet lady ,isfj
THE HEALTHIEST ENTJ,isfj
Not everyone voting an Si type   ,isfj
One of the few open minded grandma s I ve ever seen  with a much developed Ne  so she has a good sense of humor,isfj
she s such a toxic   hard to type person i genuinely have no clue about her enneagram maybe a   or a    she seems like an Si dom and when she took    personalities she got ISFJ   i felt like the functions fit her too but she could be an ISTJ  she sorta only has Fe towards my grandfather   in some social settings  she literally lives to serve him    men in general   i do see some Ti in her as well  but at times she can seem Te ish in how she reacts to things   people she doesn t like  but I don t really see any Fi in her  then again she s a person who i feel like could be repressing her real personality but idk   she s very hard to understand   type  especially her enneagram,isfj
My Grandma on my mom side is a EXTREMELY unhealthy  w  and Si dom omg,isfj
having an ESTP grandma is    something else entirely,isfj
she s so nice and kind  I like her so much,isfj
My ESFJ grandma is the biggest gossiper she talks to literally everyone and tells them all their faults in their faces    yeah,isfj
I was raised by my grandma and oh boy  she can be a Karen sometimes  She sympathizes with the unfortunate but she s also the type of person who would speak up to a restaurant and ask for the manager  I love my grandma and she cares for me more than anything in this world  but being with her can be exhausting sometimes  she won t stop complaining and giving comments about others ,isfj
she s the most obvious si dom i ve meet  always relying on her past experiences and frequently telling me stories about our family and her youth  Te because she values the final result of her work and productivity also she is rather a fact based person than a feeler one  I love her  ,isfj
My grandma is such an ESTJ it hurts and my grandpa is an ISTJ  idek how my ENFJ mom lasted growing up,isfj
ISTJ with very strong Te  makes me suspect ESTJ at times  most people in our extended family are xxFx and amidst them  my grandmother has a reputation for being dominating and aggressively lawful ,isfj
the most chill grandma ever  very much a Te dom  she tells people everything in their face and is brutally honest  this usually leads to fights but she just doesn t care  her Fi inferior is also really funny because she ll think for    minutes if she should buy a magazine or not spend money  that s what i like about her   ,isfj
im surprised to see that everyone s grandma got some choleric in her  huh ,isfj
She s a lawful  serious  and strict woman with a no nonsense attitude  However  she s very fond of animals and has worked as a school nurse for over    years  She told me that during her childhood  she tended to avoid people and preferred to talk to animals  particularly birds  I love her ,isfj
Uhm    I ll just go ,isfj
Most amazing grandma ever,isfj
Old person   SJ,isfj
My grandma is the countertype for enneagram    She is very confrontational and opinionated  but she also is always thinking about what can go wrong  She has stock piled household supplies and cans of food in her basement just in case it s needed  It was good to have her during the pandemic  but she did get a bit paranoid with how much she cleaned  using lysol wipes and those lights that kill germs   I didn t mind that much because I disintegrated from   to   when I get stressed  so it was good to have someone else that thought a bit like me  too  Sorry for info dump  I apologize ,isfj
She was a really strong woman  probably a little too tough and unforgiving with others and herself sometimes  but she always fought for her beliefs and was a huge  power behind the throne  in my grandfather s career and life ,isfj
she have depression  she never leaves her house since her husband died from cancer  she s really interesting  feels like she know everything  she s really smart,isfj
my grandma is a proud asian tiger mom that snipes me with her sandals whenever i step out of line XD  she is also obsessed with hot red for good fortune and money    her philosophy   a good kid   a rich kid   ,isfj
Everyone I know has an ISFJ  w  grandmother ,isfj
She was a military mechanic during Vietnam  ikr   she is very nice but isn t much of a casual small talk   oh  you look so nice today  person  She s highly concerned with logic and isn t touchy feely  She tends to express love through gifts  I love her so much ,isfj
 me wants to surprise my grandma with new shoes     mom tells me to ask my grandma first     Grandma  No   Me internally   why       Grandma  It s pandemic  I can t go anywhere  Just gimme the money ,isfj
Powerful matriarch  I respect her more as she ages  I didn t know there was that much time in a day to raise   kids  work as a full time nurse  cook every single meal then work in the garden  hostess every holiday and can vegetables at home  like wtf how    ,isfj
Its funny how both my paternal and maternal grandmothers are XSTJs  but I appreciate the latter more  She has healthier Te than my paternal grandmother ,isfj
love her,isfj
I miss her  she was a very fun person  I wish we were closer,isfj
Honestly she s the best  most of my family is filled with fi users which is great but it s practically an expectation to share your opinion about everything and engage in debates about opinions ,isfj
send  help  please  she is so funny but I just can t with her    ,isfj
I often struggle getting along with her   we are very different and opposite to each other  can t stand her criticism,isfj
never met her but talking to my mom we figured out she was definitely an ISTJ   ,isfj
i can t tell if she s so sx or so sp  that s a mystery,isfj
My Abuelita is an ENTJ  she literally raised my mom and my aunts alone  Pog,isfj
i love her sm,isfj
Unhealthy ENFJ in a Fe Se loop  I love her but sometimes she is soooooo annoying  but normally we get along well ,isfj
Finally figured out her type  I think  D Fe makes sense while she is definitely not Si valuing and her Se is very good too  Mbti type was pretty easy to determine  I know her childhood from her stories and based on that she seems like an obvious Se dom  Overall she s always been very opinionated and she has mostly done things she wanted  without taking into account what others think  therefore I assume Fi Fe  Ni is the function I can see in her when she s stressed,isfj
Badass queen I love her sm,isfj
 deleted ,isfj
why so sp over sp so  i definitely agree she s sx blind but i don t see so dominant  from what i know  to combat their fear  social   s primarily rely on a set of rules  specific ideology  or abstract reasoning in general to guide them through life  they believe that in abiding by certain rules or relying on a specific authority they will achieve security  if you observe her character  you can see she doesn t really have this firm set of rules she follows  instead  i think she fits the description of sp   a lot better  self pres   s seek to gather companions   alliances by appearing friendly and trustworthy  in order to combat the fear they have that the world is dangerous  they look for protection in others by asserting a friendly demeanor  in my opinion this fits her a lot better  i haven t watched hq in a while so there aren t any really specific scenes i d be able to point out  but if anyone else has any feel free to leave them in the replies  and if anyone reading this voted her as so  pls leave ur reasoning in the replies as well  id love to hear y all s perspective ,isfj
this woman is the most stereotypical Enneagram   in the world,isfj
Why eii  I can t really see her as fi base at all  I was kind of surprised that there were no sei votes  She is also a super classic example of an sp  in naranjo subtypes ,isfj
best girl     i love her sm,isfj
i think she isn t phlegmatic  dom   temperaments are abt emotional dispositions  and a purely phlegmatic person usually react to different things in a static way  but she isn t like that  her expressions are often explicit and dramatic  it s visible in all of her crumbs  esp in s  ,isfj
i keep thinking about the anxiety energy meme  ,isfj
yachi my love    anyways as limbic    fix  and inf Ne as it gets  a terrifying combination  poor yachi   also  i think shes a      the integration disintegration paths of   fit her really well  integrating to   makes sense for her entire character arc imo     When moving in their Direction of Disintegration  stress   complacent Nines suddenly become anxious and worried at Six  However  when moving in their Direction of Integration  growth   slothful  self neglecting Nines become more self developing and energetic  like healthy Threes  ,isfj
Can someone explain reasoning for inf Ne  I don t disagree I just saw her profile and realised I have no clue what her type could be   I watched Haikyu ages ago so I m assuming it s correct lmao ,isfj
why not phlegmatic sanguine ,isfj
for the people doubting her   enneagram  she definitely gives off some strong   vibes  but just watch her first appearances on the show  she s anxious about EVERYTHING  example  she runs away the minute she meets ukai  thinking she s gonna get killed  she s just seriously the   stereotype  always thinking of the worst scenario  there s a possibility she s a   and disintegrated because of her mom or something  but i definitely think it s just her truest self to be this fearful and anxious ,isfj
a ton of people below have made arguments for ISFJ that i totally agree with  I think the reason ISFP makes a lot of sense to a lot of people is the fact that he was constantly put into situations that forced him to develop his often ignored fi ,isfj
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,isfj
You guys need to understand the difference between Fe vs Fi  Fe is not  worrying about the other people  and Fi is not  I do what I want and idc anyone else       What really matters is the motivation behing his values  When Fi and Fe are in Dom   Aux position  that means they use their values and morals for taking decisions  Fi takes his own values  they have constructed them by their own  Fe takes the values from their groups  and their motivation behind is make everyone feel the same values  they look for social harmony   With that being said  Steve is clearly a Fe user  The concept of the Captain America is something what he strongly believes  and he would like that all the people take this concept  these values  and agree with them  That s why a lot of social activists are  ENFJ  ESFJ  ISFJ  INFJ  That s what they look for  a common cause  an ideal of a good  respectful and reasonable society   But well  for all the people voting for ISFP  how can Steve be TE INF  How this guy uses his Ni tert for     future plans  Where do you se a Fi Ni loop  For a while I thought he could be an ISFP  but I can t see Steve as a person who lacks of planning  not even Se aux  I recommend study the cognitive functions  this is what matters   Stand for what he believes in  and his decisions in CW are not a valid argument for ISFP sorry I don t make the rules  xx,isfj
Why would Cap be SX   SP ,isfj
Peggy Carter was an LIE  Steve Rogers ESI  Well  that s a very good example of Socionics Duality,isfj
he bases all of his decisions on what is best for everyone  often causing him to neglect his own needs  Fe vibes much ,isfj
He is very true to his values  He followed orders because he wanted to be a soldier and do what he believed was right  He did this until in  Winter Soldier  his values are questioned   Follow orders  or  do what s right   He decided to do what s right   Also he does not really care if others  like  him   If this page would allow voting by Cognitive Functions  Hidden Feature Request here   I would Vote Fi and Si and Te   ISTJ developing Fi is most likely ,isfj
  jackoliveraaron  I m wondering why you voted LSE for Captain America ,isfj
alright before y all get aggressive  IM NOT SAYING HE USES FI  but can someone explain Fe  it s not often that you see Fe users so confident in what they believe is right  so i was just hoping someone could explain it so i could get a better understanding,isfj
 Put on the suit  Let s go a few rounds   Fi   more than fe  I think an fe user would ve kept in to keep more peace  Cap tends to start a lot of drama with people that hurt his honor or values like his shield or being the right man  It s funny cause most of his team in civil war were fi users or low fe users and Tony s team was mostly fe users  Tony thought as a group and for civilians sake that they should mostly stop  fe   Cap disagreed because it wasn t right to him  Fi  ,isfj
I don t really see a melancholic blend in shy here like I can see  for example  sanguine in RD or melancholic in rarity  now  you may say everyone has different concentration of blends  and while that is true  at some point the blend needs to stop being considered secondary right   a key difference between phleg pure and phleg mel is that phleg   mels have a need to be independent  rarely show emotion or affection  more non   emotional than other phleg blends  persistent in their tasks  tend to be slightly sarcastic while confronting and pressuring other people  phleg doms are toned down significantly in these traits   I dont feel like any of these really fit fluttershy s character,isfj
Why not Phlegmatic  Dominant    According to the net    Phlegmatic individuals tend to be relaxed  peaceful  quiet  and easy going  They are sympathetic and care about others  yet they try to hide their emotions  Phlegmatic individuals are also good at generalising ideas or problems to the world and making compromises     People with a phlegmatic personality are very agreeable    Phlegmatics could be described as cooperative  considerate  charitable  sympathetic  trusting  and warm  They like to express their feelings  sometimes dramatizing their experience  which is the evidence of high estrogen activity  ,isfj
If Mikan Tsumiki had kins she definitely kin Fluttershy,isfj
Why did it took so long for people to realize she isnt melancholic,isfj
Where do y all see Melancholic being her main temperament  Pleg Mel makes far more sense ,isfj
I don t have anything to say here except congrats on typing this character correctly  The mane   s enneagrams seem to be such a trouble to spot for this website  like with rarity being typed as  w  instead of  w   twilight as  w  instead of  w   and Rainbow Dash originally being mistyped as a    Glad Fluttershys enneagram was gotten right instead of God forbid being typed as a   ,isfj
 Phlegmatic Melancholic  quiet and thoughtful  these people tend to be introverts  but perhaps more people focused than the reverse blend  They are gentle and inoffensive and often hate conflict  due to the peaceful nature of the phlegmatic and the sensitive perfectionism of the melancholic  These two sides to their personality may sometimes conflict with each other  This can mean the difference between being slow to go through with a task and wanting to do it properly  Similarly  phleg mels can have similar issues with expressing their opinions  as they may want to be heard yet not want to risk offending  It s not that they don t have emotions or opinions  its just that they can be slow to experience them and even slower to voice them   Phleg Mels can be very easy going about some things and surprisingly over sensitive about others  If hurt by someone  they may be offended if the other person is wrong or have a crisis in confidence if the other person is right  They may feel uncomfortable with change  with their main motivation towards it being that it s the right thing to do  For some  they may not be the most fun  exciting company to have  but they are usually kind and reliable  and are content to just listen to others when needed    If you have watched MLP  you should know though Fluttershy s predominant need is to accomodate  phlegmatic   there is also a perfeccionistic  critical side of her that is always beating around the corner  she tries to avoid it so she can maintain herself in control and stay harmonious  also part of her nature as a   core   however she has emotional outbursts and show a more negative and picky side of her quite often  That s why she is limbic on the Big Five  if she was calm then maybe phlegmatic dominant would fit her  But yes  melancholic is a secondary need for her instead of primary   About  L    V  honestly I m not sure but the logic for me is that her volition is not really flexible  but rather that she struggles being assertive  She has her priorities pretty sorted out but doesn t know how to be forceful and comes off anxious when taking the lead which are characteristics of  V  On the other way  she is flexible with ideas  I think the way she dealt with Discord fits  L better ,isfj
i haven t watched MLP in a long time but melancholic phlegmatic  melancholics are analytical  methodical  organized  and critical  how is fluttershy any of those things ,isfj
So glad to see she s voted as sei now ,isfj
why not FELV  im no expert on AP but she seems very  V to me  and why lemancholic  y all are crazy    and are the INFP votes rising or am I tripping ,isfj
acting like a stereotypical ISFJ is so handy  like specifically working in groups or dealing with people in general,isfj
Sometimes l gotta show some discipline ,isfj
I sometimes hide my eight but it slips out nstantly in alot of situations,isfj
When passing by the streets without talking  cause people can have very sus intentions ,isfj
Nothing has changed that much except that I m an introvert that has no problem talking with random people,isfj
not really a mask but I tend to act like an ESTJ either when I have to get work done or when I m ranting  bout random       dk why it s just fun as hell to let my Te loose from time to time lmao,isfj
worksona  to seem more professional  ISTJ   persona when talking to friends  relatives  strangers  ISFJ,isfj
this  masked  personality makes me feel better,isfj
my persona in my school idk but sometimes trying to use Te feels weird what if this is my actual personality  ,isfj
He s clearly an ISFJ  In the last episodes we can see him obviously wanting to help people as much as posible  and when he explains that sometimes he  disconnects   it is the typical ennea     ennea     ISFJ loop    At least thats what i percieve  as a INFJ     myself  I feel quite identified with him  in the way that i wanna help people but i keep feeling selfish and thinking i ve messed up everything     i love him sm  i m so proud that he can finnally be happy   ,isfj
he s literally the most  S I ever seen please guys,isfj
sorry guys but for me otis is clearly INFP  and no one in the world will make me change my mind,isfj
Why cant he be an ISTJ  I see a Te Fi on him,isfj
I really don t understand why anyone would say he s an INTP,isfj
He is just dumb and stupid in a good way,isfj
hate this mf so much   worst character in the show  respectfully,isfj
can someone explain why   ,isfj
he might be an unhealthy INFJ  ,isfj
ah yes he s an INTP because he is awkward  it must be fe inferior      s,isfj
Guys  why in the world would she be an ESI   ESIs have Se ego  They are strong willed  assertive  confident with conflict  decisive  etc  backing up their moral judgements of other people  They tend to judge others very harshly and devote themselves to fighting against  bad people  however they can   Shoto Todoroki is an example of an ESI   Meanwhile  Yaoyorozu is none of those  She lacks the physicality and decisiveness of the high Se types like Todoroki  Bakugo  etc  which causes her a lot of insecurity during and after the tournament arc  Her actually strong qualities are her pragmatic intelligence and creativity  those being related to Te and Ne respectively  In fact she uses her creativity in order to overcome her insecurity about weak Se in the fight against Aizawa  with help from her dual Todoroki ,isfj
Reposting because ESI Yaoyorozu is still a very infuriating mistype   What I said on Discord when asked why I thought she was LIE   I observed in her extreme strength in her ability to learn information and understand how to apply it practically  as seen for example in her explanation for why Iida was the MVP  Also in her ability to memorize information which she often uses for her quirk  Very skilled at practical matters  and also shows plenty of creativity with her creative quirk  pun intended  and ability to see potential and come up with innovative solutions to problems  such as creating the insulation blanket in season   so Kaminari can use his electricity  or hiding the flash grenades in the Russian nesting dolls in the fight with Eraser head  Actually her whole plan in that fight was extremely creative  This all shows clear strength in Ne  however she s also shown to be ambitious and take her status seriously  indicating Ni Se valued  Lastly  she grows insecure about her lack of ability to think in the moment and be decisive  which becomes a defining character trait after the tournament arc  and she overcomes this insecurity using her creativity in the fight with Eraser Head  which is consistent with Se mobilizing  Overcoming insecurities over lack of decisiveness and toughness using her creativity and intelligence is exactly the same character arc as Sokka from ATLA  who was also LIE ,isfj
i totally see ni in her but I ll settle for ISFJ for now  also type    I can see it as she is shown to come in useful but she seemed to be more of a type   to me as she focused on success and overcomes  but whichever works,isfj
Part   All I see is an ISFJ in her  I m going to be doing some generalizations and stereotypes but I think they fit  I use a lot of examples of quotes because I feel others on here have done a good job arguing why she s an ISFJ based on decisions and things     Mom Stereotype Tradition  She fits this one pretty aggressively  She s wanting to be helpful yet practical at any chance  She offers to help catch her classmates up  At least in the English dub a very  Moms got you   Type tone  She comforts Lida when he thinks he  Let everyone down  Momo says  Your the reason we won  Thank goodness for that special move of yours   Again English dub but it s said in a very reassuring Motherly tone  She got extremely excited when her classmates wanted study help saying  When finished you will all be modal students  This just comes off like a very ISFJ type statement  Modal citizen  Well behaved  rule follower  Doing the proper thing  More ISFJ talk the INFJ  When inviting them to her home She focused on small details like what type of tea they might want and then started chattering on about how in her family they have  always had Wedgwood tea  And how she says  I must call mother and have her prepare the great hall for us to set up  This is a small detail but it s a very ISFJ trait to bring up what their family will drink and what is traditional for them  Again that by itself isn t much but adding with other things I think it s a good example I think an INFJ just wouldn t likely bring that sort of thing up unless asked about it  She also felt the need to bring her bed from Home  Again yes this by itself could happen to any character but the show Manga made a point of pointing it out for her   She also mentions  It takes up so much room but it s maybe not quite as creative as yours  referring to the other students room designs  This just seems very ISFJ  Willing to have something from home dominant the room and where an INFJs room I d expect to be more creative and interesting     Rule Follower  There are several examples of this but one that sticks out is in one of the episodes it gets suggested why she doesn t just create more money things and she reacts concerned expressing  Well technically but that s against the rules  If I started making everything think of the impact on the economy  we must insure the flow of commerce it s our civic duty as citizens   Referencing the  civic duty as citizens  just comes off very ISFJ follow the rules more then it would an INFJ   INFJs Often have and are known for trusting their intuitions and instincts  Momo does this sometimes but it s clearly her much weaker function  She constantly self doubts her decisions and what to do like when teaming up with Todoroki ,isfj
I think there can be a lot of confusion with her type but I believe she is an INFJ because she is always planning for the future and she used her Ni dominantly to figure out the meaning behind what Mr Aizawa was planning with his threat of suspending  If you mix that with her enneagram  w  then you will get the perfect mental strategist  I think people can get especially mixed up with typing her with ni or si because she overuses her fe  she values harmony and is afraid of not being there to help her classmates when they need her  She is less confident in her own abilities because she doesn t want to let her classmates down  but as the series goes on we see her leaning more into her dominant function of ni which seems more natural for her  She isn t demanding and brushing feelings to the side to get to a structured goal and her kind nature clearly shows her phlegmatic nature along with her attention to detail in her melancholic side  which can be mistaken for si  overall I think this makes her an inspiring leader and that s just what Momo is ,isfj
I refuse to believe that the first consensus was ESTJ,isfj
Momo strikes me more as a limbic type than calm  I didn t watch this show for quite a while  but she was often anxious and panicking a lot when it comes to fighting  Idk if that s only because of the   core or something tho   ,isfj
THE perfect definition of a  w   I think si fe sounds good,isfj
Why            or     even  Other than being an Fe user I don t think   fits too well tbh  She s supportive and helpful but I think she s ultimately more focused on success and good results rather than looking after and taking care of others  I think this might also be why she initially looks a bit like a Te user on the surface     If anyone wants to share their reasoning for       then feel free to do so ,isfj
I love her sm i hate the fact that people only see her as a shy or submissive girl even in here they type her as a shy INFP stereotype,isfj
hinata is ixfp who looks like an ISFJ  her fi becomes healthier after being indirectly encourage by naruto to find her  ninja  way which is his fi influencing her fi in a healthier  she has that eerie voice to suggest fi dom ,isfj
It s sad how intuitive bias will lead fans to want to type any character they deem likable or relatable as intuitive  when it s kind of apparent that Naruto and Hinata have the dynamic of the classic ESFP and ISFJ couple  Naruto is arguably one of the most action oriented characters in the history of shounen and is an obvious Se dom  whereas fans simply won t accept that not every shy and kindhearted character has to be an INFP ,isfj
Hopefully a few who think she s ISFJ will hear me out on this  I do believe she can also be typed as ISFJ but I am gonna explain how she can be typed as INFP  How she uses fi more   I d like to start with fact we have a character from the manga canonly says Hinata is a lot like Naruto  Who is ENFP  most likely  which shares the same cognitive functions as Hinata  INFP if we were to type her as this  but in a different order   Fi users form a set of core values that are tied closely to their identity  When faced  with conflicting values  they are more likely to stubbornly take a stance against said values  regardless of the group opinion    Example  both Neji   Kiba telling her to quit and her not doing it and fighting it anyway yes due to Naruto cheering her on but also her wanting to change herself  Hinatas whole character is about wanting to better herself not just about being with naruto   They can be a bit more classically rebellious  in that way  possessing a sort of inborn activist mentality  especially when they feel like their own personal identity is somehow threatened by a connection to that group    Example  her guard telling her not to go in and help Naruto she did this  This can go back to hinatas personal identity how Naruto made her like herself a bit more and feel like she changed  He had that effect on her and she fell in love with it  Someone threatened the person who sparked this change she instantly went into to protect him regardless of what her guard said this can go back to  in born activist  I d also like to add also   Naruto telling her  to go you can t win run away  and her still proceeding to try to him   she says  I know I m here because I want to be I almost took the wrong path so many times but you showed me the right way you changed me your smile so I m not afraid to die protecting you  this can go back to the individualist traits INFP have    Fi types tend to experience feelings with far greater continuity  intensity  and richness than Fe types because feelings are only ever known as  personal  and they are thus very intertwined with one s sense of identity    Hinata is constantly talking about her identity and herself  how she changed how she wanted to change  I d like to Note they said personal and acknowledge Hinata never seemed to show any anger or hostility at Neji nor really her father  Even after the abuse she endured by them  She took most of her negative feelings out on herself not anyone else     Fe differentiates from Fi because Fi are strong individualist  and will naturally struggle against any perceived attempts to snuff out their individuality  I d like to add Individualist are an advocate of a social theory favouring freedom of action for individuals over collective or state control   Example  her not wanting to control her kids and she even lets himawari choose if she wants to be a ninja a not considering how her past was she doesn t want to reflect this onto her kids  She s also continuously self reflecting on her actions   Hinata who had been left alone stared at the back of her fathers figure which has become small her father was different compared to the past even present was about to be different  There are things that don t change  that surely could not be said about me though  she had to change from a shameful mother who can t let her children go to a mother that can acknowledge precisely the growth of her children   Would like to add sasuke mentions how hinatas shyness was irritating and she couldn t form an opinion of her own seemed to go with the group and he states she gradually changed over a period of years and is more confident of herself  This can support why Hinata can be see more as an ISFJ in part   but as of right now Hinata in boruto is confident and exhibits more of the dominant fi ,isfj
here in this comment I will explain why Hinata is not an ISFJ but an INFP  Before differentiating FE from FI let s talk about her NE SI  One of the characteristics of NE is that thinks in different possibilities  one of the characteristics of Hinata in the show is about this indecision for not being able to decide between the possibilities  it is common to see Hinata saying  what do I do  in the episodes mainly when she is close to Naruto  she also does not stick to the rules as some say in the comments of this profile for example in the first phase of the chunin exam  when she is taking the exam she ignores the rules and is willing to pass the answers to Naruto  an SI dom would think  I won t do that  it s against the rules  but Hinata broke the rule  in the third phase of the chunin exam  Neji  I think we all agree that Neji is a SI dom  ISTJ  anyway in the exam Neji talks about the conflicts of the Hyuuga clan  Hinata insults Neji  and says that only he is bothered by the conflicts of the Hyuuga clan  which shows the difference of a  SI dom NE inf  and a  NE aux SI terc    Also we can see that Hinata s SI is childlike  the tertiary function is usually the most childlike  one of the characteristics of SI is to think about the past  we can see Hinata constantly thinking about her past actions in a childlike way  thinking like   Why did I do that   I shouldn t have done such things   I did the right thing  which makes me think of an SI as tertiary  Another important point is  TI tertiary  She is the least logical character in the whole franchise  she only does things based on her feelings  really   One of the main arguments for FE is because in the fight between Naruto and Pain she invades the fight and sacrifices herself to save Naruto  there are two reasons why I don t think this is FE     Hinata loves Naruto lovingly  based on this I don t believe that this is FE  even a former ExTJ can have this kind of behavior with the ones he loves  I didn t see any sign of  FE  from Hinata without being with Naruto and the people she loves    FE Altruism is LIE  FE will only try to balance the environment around it  IF  will try to balance its own feelings  but both will be linked to empathy and kindness  consider someone using FE for kindness is stereotype  Hinata always had difficulties expressing her emotions  she only expressed her feelings for naruto after years  when they were practically adults  as I said above  Hinata only expressed FE signs with naruto  Well in conclusion  I think she is clearly FI NE SI with TE as the weakest function in the main stack  only other type I see in hinata is ESFJ but I see more FI than FE  That s it  have a nice day      ,isfj
Hinata has no Fi  at all  Even if you get outside her feelings towards Naruto  Hinata still wants to be useful to the people around her  She trains nonstop as a kunoichi so she can prove herself to her father and sister that she is worthy of being a Hyuga  She cooperates extremely well with her teammates Kiba and Shino  even though she is quiet and shy  She knows her place in the group and uses her Byakugan for its intended purpose   tracking  Team    unlike Teams   and     never really had large disputes or infighting between its members  the closest real fight is one in which Kiba and Shino argue about what they should do during the exam itself  Hinata tries to smooth tensions between her teammates so they can get along  She is worried about Akamaru when the latter was terrified of Gaara in the Forest and asks Kiba if he is going to be okay  Hinata keens in on Neji s true feelings in her match against him  and she realizes that he is only lying to himself about destiny and how he is fighting against his fate all along  In that same match  Hinata is thinking about Shino and Kiba  wanting them to watch her match so they can understand how serious and devoted she is as a kunoichi  wanting to be valuable in their eyes   In The Last  Hinata willingly cooperates with Toneri to save her sister  During Naruto s coronation as Hokage  Hinata makes sure that she retrieves his Hokage cloak personally  In Boruto  Hinata becomes a dutiful housewife who accommodates Mitsuki and Kawaki  feeding them and making sure they are happy in her care  She is respectful and uses honorifics for everyone  even her teammates and peers  and still uses them for her husband Naruto in Boruto  In the same series  Hinata is reluctant on saying her true feelings about Naruto neglecting their family for his Hokage duties  She only confides in Shino  her past teammate whom she trusts immensely to keep her secret   Hinata has a lot of Si  She respects her family traditions and trains herself to be the next heir of her clan  She shows a lot of reverence towards Hamura  her clan s ancestor  in The Last  Hinata is very cautious about putting herself in harm s way or saying anything that could get her in trouble  Hinata does not reveal her true feelings towards Naruto  even when they are obvious  until much later in the story  She stays with her team and relies on their skills to protect her during the Forest Exam  other teams separated on their own  Hinata s childhood impressions of Naruto and his courage and determination inspire her to come out of her shell  Her love for Naruto is based not on physical attractiveness or charisma  but how he made her feel special in the past  Hinata takes up her role as the Hokage s wife seriously  making sure Naruto fulfills his duties to the village and that Boruto keeps up with his studies in the academy  In Boruto  Hinata takes up a hobby in competitive eating at Ichiraku Ramen  the place of her first date with Naruto  and would not settle towards going anywhere else   She does not have Ne  Even if she were in a Fi Si loop  she does not have Fi  She is not an INFP ,isfj
Naruto kun     Usually so shy are ISFJ,isfj
Part    Part   in comments  Hinata to me just clearly seems ISFJ  I just don t see an INFP  As I often do I ll make some generalizations and stereotypes here but I think they fit and I feel examples I give display a more consistent ISFJ  I think some here have to much nostalgia and focus to much on Part   Hinata to argue she s an INFP and even that version I don t see as an INFP but I can see the arguments better in that version  But again when typing a character I feel you need to look at the whole picture from start to finish of the character  Heck if I wanted to be really stingy technically the page only lists Shippuden and Boruto and if only counting canon content she has way more screen time in both then in part   naruto  Here are my reasons she s an ISFJ   Shy vs Meek  Being shy is not remotely an INFP exclusive trait  Yes it s a stereotype that INFPs have strongly linked to them and I d give this one merit for the argument just like I m giving ISFJs stereotypes merit but Hinata wasn t shy with everyone  Honestly watching the show she s only shy with Naruto for the most part and outside of that I question if she s really that  shy  at all  She s a bit timid with others but not shy  Hinata is meek very much like an ISFJ  Meek is not the same as shy  She doesn t like conflict she s quite soft spoken and gentle but besides Naruto if spoken to by someone she s not really shy just extra carful not to upset someone in part    She s fine talking to her teammates and Sakura and after Neji chills out on her she s not really scared of him  She still acts meek but again that s different then shy  And by Shippuden you see her even acting a bit less meek and certainly not shy just introverted  By late Shippuden and boruto she s not even shy at all anymore   High value on Tradition and family  This isn t something exclusive to ISFJs I m aware but given a large amount of her story arcs outside of naruto revolve around wanting to please her family and she falls in line super easy this doesn t seem very INFP and seems more like an ISFJ written character  She doesn t challenge her fathers expectations she might have different motivations for getting stronger but she s still technically doing what her father wants  I m sorry but INFPs are more willing to challenge things or at least not fall in line so easily  Given her story arcs if she was written as an INFP I feel we would have seen this more aggressively  Hinata honestly doesn t challenge anything coming if it s from someone she loves or cares about  Someone here said  She can t bring herself to follow her clans traditions   When  She might not aways agree with them but she still falls in line it s not like we have some story arc where she s like  No I m not going to listen to the clan anymore and screw you dad  And even the disagreement with her clan stuff is very subtitle resistance which is more of an ISFJ trait from what I ve seen  Someone also brought up a good point the only main scene where she does what  She wants  is when saving naruto but I hardly see this a major act of rebellion  The one guy she was with told her not to put herself in danger and that he would get in trouble if something happen to her  She did put herself in danger but this wasn t some  By helping naruto and putting myself in danger Im turning my back on everything our clan stands for  type of moment  Sure people would be upset but it wasn t some testament to go against her clan ,isfj
I know the ISFJ stereotype fits her  but somehow her having higher Ti than Sakura doesn t make sense to me ,isfj
 shy character exist   People on PDB  omg obviously an INFP  ,isfj

Who is voting ESFJ     ,isfj
Oh my god what is this sudden bomb of ESFJ votes,isfj
I find it strange that the last time I logged into kobeni s profile  INFP was the second most voted type  surprisingly ESFJ is the second most voted type almost reaching ISFJ,isfj
how TF did those ESFJ votes get so high isn t she the embodiment of inferior Ne,isfj
my god  she s the literal manifestation of a    She s barely a      is her ,isfj
Wasn t she ISFP before   I swear did I switch timelines or something,isfj
Can someone please tell me why she isn t a INFP,isfj
I have to say  my first impression that Kobeni thought she was a  w   I don t know much about the ennegram  but now I m pretty sure she s  w ,isfj
i think she s a  L idk but definitely not  L,isfp
can someone explain FELV ,isfp
I took a second look into her just to check my past typing  and from what I could find  I actually think she s most likely an INFP  From the quotes I can gather and interviews I looked over  I think I can confidently claim that she is an Fi dom and on the Ne Si axis  Here s a few quotes that back up the idea of her leading with Fi      I m not like a persona  I m not a caricature of myself       I write my own songs  I made my own videos  I pick my producers  Nothing goes out without my permission  It s all authentic       When I was young I felt really overwhelmed and confused by the desire not to end up in an office  doing something I didn t believe in       I already have success  I had it a long time ago  It s nothing to do with my music  Music is secondary  at this point  The good stuff is really good  but I have success because I m at peace and I m a good person in my everyday life and that s important    As for her Ne  I see her surreal perspective of reality as proof of this  as she doesn t seek viewing reality at it s highest pitch of actuality  but rather through a great scope of possibilities  Here are some quotes that back up the idea that she has auxiliary Ne rather than Se      I mainly let my imagination be my reality  Fantasy is my reality       When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day  and myself too  I had a sort of a philosophical crisis  I couldn t believe that we were mortal       I was always an unusual girl  My mother told me I had a chameleon soul  no moral compass pointing due north  no fixed personality  just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean       I m more interested in  you know  SpaceX and Tesla  what s going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities       When you have absolutely no idea what s going to happen to you or what your career s going to end up like and you re just really open to anything  then you don t really have anything to loose       The act of surrendering sort of puts me in a different mindset that allows me to be more of a channel   because I m not holding on so tightly to things  I m letting go  and I find that in letting go I become more of a channel for life to really happen on life s terms  I mean  maybe that sounds sort of metaphysical  but that s honestly how I feel    In addition to that  as heavily detailed in a past comment of mine  I believe she is a Si user  as she views the world around her through her personalized lens of reality  Her connection to the physical realm is very personalized  seen best in how she doesn t attempt to maximize the sensory stimuli she receives  but rather looks deeper into her own impressions  Here are some quotes that help back up tertiary Si  and are quite anti Se or Ni by consequence      Nothing I ever wrote had a message  It was just my own personal experience       I m interested in the gorgeous side of life  but also familiar with the dark side too       I don t even do anything in real life  I just sit in my studio and write  I call my friends  I watch television  I don t do anything       I wish I could escape into some alter ego  just so I could feel more comfortable onstage       I have a great appreciation for our world s history  I learn from my own mistakes  I learn from the mistakes we ve made as a human race    Overall  from the quotes I provided  I think it s fair to conclude that Lana is most likely an INFP  Also  for anyone interested  I have more quotes listed on my site  which is a work in progress at the moment  The link to that is in the bio of my profile  Hope this overview helps  ,isfp
why sx   I think so   or sx   makes more sense than sx   ,isfp
I am still having a hard time figuring out her enneagram since I am still newish  I am leaning more towards  w   Could someone explain the difference between  w  and  w  ,isfp
She s been widely typed as an ISFP for a long time  but I m still hesitating between ISFP INFP   What I ve seen from her is she doesn t have much  kinesthetic intelligence   Se user are skillful at controlling their body  which makes them quite great at dancing  e p  we have MJ  Prince  Lady Gaga  Lana has never danced or showed sth about her kinesthetic intelligence  Her song is about  being wild  and  experiencing the world   but that s also a thing Ne user can do    Ne users  mindset is about  concrete things in an abstract way   Who can see and experience  Blue Banister    living in shades of cool    my body is a map of L A  in the real concrete world  Concrete objects she described contains so much metaphors and hidden meanings   The last thing is  she s stuck to her original  self image  since her debut  which is so similar to Fi Si s sense of self  Si makes it a little bit more past focused and rigid  also  Ni s image is much more diverse ,isfp

 ANOTHER MULTI POST THREAD   FINALLY I WILL EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN         AND    Many months ago I promised to do this on a Mitski thread  but I needed time to gather all my thoughts  and people s arrogance was kind of pissing me off so I refrained   THEN WE WILL ANALYZE LANA OFF STAGE AND SEE WHAT SHE S LIKE   Everyone is complaining that I m only focusing on her lyrics  even tho I m not and even tho y all do exactly the same       Y all be like  she s a   because of Ride and Ultraviolence   she s a   because her songs are doom and gloom   she s a   because she s shy in interviews  but when I say she s a   because of Ride and Ultraviolence  I m  focusing too much on her song lyrics   When I say these interviews show her   fixations  I m not looking at her real self  apparently    It s just double standards  Nothing s ever enough for y all  because y all are absolutely determined to see her as an Image type no matter how contradictory it is  and no matter how much reasoning everyone else provides    Anyway  Rant aside  Let s get to business ,isfp
I M HERE AFTER HIS INSTA POSTS BRUH DID HE TOOK TEST AND THIS TIME GOT INTP  HE S NOT INTP LET S SAY THIS RIGHT FROM THE GET GO LET S JUST FIRST START THAT HE CAN T BE T TYPE IDK HOW TO EXPLAIN IT BUT HE S THE BIGGEST ISFP I VE EVER SAW CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE ,isfp
I think he got INTP because first of   p sucks  Second his Ni is developing  I think this is why his INTP came out of the test ,isfp
For the people wanting proof that Jungkook is Ti dominant  ISTP  instead of Fi dominant  ISFP   here s my contribution    Jungkook says from             in BTS s  Be hind Story  Interview   I think I m quite similar to Jin in character  I m straightforward  I m not simple per se  I do have things in mind that I d like to express but I don t have enough data accumulated  I have ideas but I can t express it       So there are many things I d like to try out and work on  but I can t express it due to the lack of data    I think that quote speaks a lot for itself  It s extremely Ti  But I d also like to point out the first part of the quote  Since a lot of people believe Jin is an INTP  Jungkook recognizing his similarity with Jin of having what seems to be Ti makes a lot of sense if Jungkook is an ISTP  Jungkook seems to recognize that they are both Ti dominant ,isfp
why is he sanguine melancholic    gen,isfp
genuine question but   why is he typed as a sx   ,isfp
Just to be clear if there are some of you just coming here     Personalities com is good to get to know MBTI  but         Personalities com is not MBTI  Check their disclaimer page  They only appropriate MBTI terms       The test from that website is too dichotomized  I vs  E or T vs  F   and that is not how MBTI works  We use cognitive functions  and Jungkook is more likely an ISFP      Taking that online test repeatedly is useless  The test could be predictable if you take it multiple times  so you could  change  your result  but your actual MBTI doesn t change that way ,isfp
This guy is ISFP  Not Ti dominant  But the type   enneagram bothered me  He is a  w  sx sp  His defense mechanism is always to distract himself from the bad things he was thinking  Remember in Bon Voyage   where he was in a scandal with his tattoo artist  He ran to the snowy mountain to get ice early in the morning to distract himself  He goes from boxing  bowling  painting  photography  video editing  etcetera from one to another and he said he could never finish them  In the      seasons greeting  his hyungs chastised him from wanting to do everything but never finishing them as soon as he gets tired or bored from it  Also  every time military enlistment or disbandment is brought up  he is always the one in the interviews that always said he didn t want to think of it and he ll just cross the road if he gets there   One thing I wanted to add that I forgot is the childhood wound of type  s  Jungkook went to Seoul at the age of     he was a growing boy who had to leave his family earlier than most children  Type  s childhood wound is lack of nurturing figure which is usually their mother  To keep their anxiety away from being disconnected from this figure of guidance  they distract themselves through work  study  or play   So  Jungkook s distraction came from anxiety  fear  and lack of guidance more than built up anger which is why I think he s a type   and not   ,isfp
Iam not sure of his Ti  but i think have Fe more than fi  and i don t see alot of te  he Has Alot of se  i don t think he is ISFP cause he is not like the most popular ISFP  w   as you can see he doesn t value his own feelings alot in all his songs he writes  and his actions with the members very like Fe and a   he doesn t have his own preferences or principles that no one can step on them  but he loves art   music   sports  food  his friends  his fans  his parents  like everyone  he is not the type let anyone see him crying and if he crys because he is very exhausted  but i think he is aware more of his thoughts and ideas  what he think about someone or something     There is a fact that when he danced PD told him he has no emotion when dancing so he went to usa to learn more   it s a great prove he is not ISFP at all they can sometimes be not good at it but at least they got emotions,isfp
Jungkook is my bias but I really want to punch him so bad   THEY ALL NEED TO KNOW HOW REALLY MBTI WORKS MAN  AND THAT HE IS FULLY AN ISFP AND NOT HALF HALF       Personalities has gone too far  If you guys are going to vote INTP here  please learn how MBTI works and not just say  oH  hE ToOk ThE mBtI TesT    iTs On His InstAgRAm StorY   Again    Personalities is NOT ACCURATE  It uses letter dichotomy which isn t the way of how MBTI was constructed  which leads to  mistypes   The real way of constructing MBTI is through cognitive functions    Plus  MBTI DOES  NOT  CHANGE  It is just that our functions just develop as we grow up  so we see different stages of one another  which is normal  MBTI tests are not      accurate  since it needs a lot of information for people to determine which functions are being used in a stack  which loops grips are being shown  and so on  In conclusion  MBTI is much more deeper than you think    Jungkook is an ISFP and will always be  He has shown well developed  and really high  Fi Se for an ISFP  like how for Fi he wants to be his genuine self  how he s so introspective and how he is so in touch with his feelings     mostly seen in interviews like this saying   I guess I would meet someone who likes me the way I am       And his dang Se is obvious  he makes use with his   senses a lot in the present and that he mainly expresses himself through gestures and his appearance  his clothing style  tattoos and piercings just make me want to SIMP for him gosh   and his will to try new things gives me YOLO vibes  and i m not surprised that he did the nevis swing UPSIDE DOWN     His Ni and Te are well developed too  I really love this guy sm since I relate to him a lot as an INFP  tho we have our differences    I extremely love this guy  I really want to explain most of my opinions here  but I have other things to attend to  which wont give me enough time  Overall  my point is    peepee is bad  Do research first ,isfp

no one would really like her in real life  ,isfp
She really hasn t such a great Te  she has a very low  unhealty Extraverted Thinking and a lot of Fi  unhealty     her behaviours are triggered by a  socially incorrect  moral code  she feels that which she does is RIGHT  as an example  during the first season  in the third episode   Stage Fighing   when Tori Vega is occupied to cleaning up food caked on the walls  she says to her that this situation isn t right   Well    you can t be nice to me when I ve been mean to you  That s not how it works    she feels that s right to be aggressive and dangerous to people  and she s  okay  with the fact that people will react to it  I suppose that Jade sees life as a war stage  in which individuals attack and other people attack  louder   L L L LLOUDER     She is very driven by her own feelings   I write what I feel     Because that makes feel you miserable  and the fact that you feel miserable makes me feel less miserable    she projects her own emotions on others  and sees the external world as an extention of her internal world  Where you see Ti or aux dom Te ,isfp
why on earth is she typed as  E  there s a big  thick  JUICY line between a difference in opinions and being wrong  she s fueled off her emotions  so it certainly isn t unbothered    to clarify  i m talking about the unbothered     emotion position in attitudinal psyche ,isfp

I don t blame anyone who types her as an ISFP  as I think it s a very valid opinion  The way she crafts her public persona  her musicality and creativity do not make it so easy to tell she s actually an INFJ  I recommend anyone who doesn t agree to watch and read some of her more personal interviews  in which she elaborates on her experiences with trauma   The first thing I want to point at are her video interviews  as her Ti Fe axis shines through in a lot of them  She is always raising relevant and analytical topics  and does this while catering towards people around her  adapting masterfully both to whoever she s talking to and the audience  Watch and compare her with Howard Stern         Miranda Sawer        and celebrity interviews  like Ellen or Oprah  On top of that  her difficulty in giving concrete examples  her never ending battle with words are just characteristically Ni dom   Look also at some of her more personal lyrics  This is tricky to do  because lyrics aren t really reliable as an analysis tool for many musicians  However  given she s always in the songwriting process  her INFJ lyricism are at full display in some of her music    I could be girl  unless you want to be man    I could be sex  unless you want to hold hands    I could be anything  I could be everything   is just poking fun at her NiFe polyidentity  This  and songs like  Aura    Poker Face    Enigma  and many others are her metaphorical way of saying she builds a Fe wall to hide her true  mysterious Ni mind    Million Reasons    Bad Romance  and  Judas  are vastly different ways  in your face and allegorical  of talking about the same issue of forgiveness that INFJs often have  In these  she finds comfort in a person who wronged her many times  failing to cut the bond she has with them  The infamous INFJ door slam is the aftermath   Perfect Illusion  and  Swine  are essentially door slam songs  the latter being a perfect example of Se grip after a devastating event   A personal favorite theme of some of her songs is the desire to seek authentic connections  escaping the difficulty of letting go of her Ni Ti or Ni Fe planning   Marry The Night    Stupid Love  are very nice displays of inferior and matured Se   I feel like I need to point the antithesis to that  When she goes on awards season mode  she s so careful to stick to the script that she sometimes comes off as cringy  That s some tunnel vision right there  Watch some of her      and      interviews  Her written interviews are not so far off  too   You can also study the rollout of ARTPOP to see what a Ni dom artist is capable of when fully distressed  Ultimately  there is way too much ground that I won t be able to cover  After all  she s a famous person with many secrets  not out of character to a INFJ who s risen to the public eye at such a young age ,isfp
When looking into Lady Gaga  ISFP makes the most sense for her from a cognitive function standpoint  Her being an IxFP type became obvious to me almost instantly as one thing that I couldn t help but notice was her very strong Fi  seen best by looking at how focused she is on authentic expression of who she is as a person without taking others values into consideration  always aiming for sincerity in herself and those around her  Here s a few quotes that back up the idea of her leading with Fi      You have to be unique  and different  and shine in your own way       To be honest  I went through a phase which  I  stand by   I stand by everything I ve done  like when I am an old lady and I m on my deathbed  I ll know that my legacy is authentic  because I ve always made things that felt true to me       Trust is like a mirror  you can fix it if it s broken  but you can still see the crack in the reflection       I learned that my sadness never destroyed what was great about me  You just have to go back to that greatness  find that one little light that s left  I m lucky I found one little glimmer stored away       Well  that s your opinion  isn t it  And I m not about to waste my time trying to change it       I m always on the market for a new friend  period  As your success continues to grow  you start to see who your real friends are  But I m always looking for wonderful people to have in my life that have no agenda and aren t fake friends       Don t you ever let a soul in the world tell you that you can t be exactly who you are       I m obsessively opposed to the typical       Friendship is only friendship when it is real  Passionate and relentless  Forgiving and joyful  Don t forget today to have real moments with your friends  Not a text  or a tweet  an Instagram   that s all deceit  Hold real hands  kiss genuine lips  be a truly strong human force    As for her Se  she is often focused on maximizing her presence in the moment and experiencing the world in its most unfiltered state  often focusing on aesthetics and maximizing her real world experiences  Here are some quotes that back up the idea that she has auxiliary Se      I would rather die than have my fans see me without a pair of heels on  And that s show business       The fashion I ve acquired over the years is so sacred to me   from costumes to couture  high fashion to punk wear I ve collected from my secret international hot spots  I keep everything in an enormous archive in Hollywood  The clothes are on mannequins  also on hangers and in boxes with a photo of each piece  and there s a website where I can go to look through everything  It s too big   I could never sort through it myself  But these garments tell the stories of my life       So basically I did this whole show carrying    lbs  looking out of one eye  dancing   and then my t ts explode at the end  It s not as easy as it looks       Live your eyeliner  breathe your lipstick  and kill for each other       My friends joke that I m dead until I get onstage  I m dead right now as you re speaking to me       And now  I m just trying to change the world  one sequin at a time    In addition to that  she also seems to have an equally prominent preference for Ni  as she is very concerned with searching for new abstract angles of viewing life  using the real world as a basis of forming her intuitive understanding of where things are heading  Here are a few quotes that suggest tertiary Ni      If you were to ask me what I want to do   I don t want to be a celebrity  I want to make a difference       I am my own sanctuary and I can be reborn as many times as I choose throughout my life       When I get stuck in that  like  that trauma response feedback in my brain  I have no concept of my body at all  I m completely in my head       I had a boyfriend who told me I d never succeed  never be nominated for a Grammy  never have a hit song  and that he hoped I d fail  I said to him   Someday  when we re not together  you won t be able to order a cup of coffee at the f cking deli without hearing or seeing me        Some women choose to follow men  and some women choose to follow their dreams  If you re wondering which way to go  remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn t love you anymore       I m telling you a lie in a vicious effort that you will repeat my lie over and over until it becomes true   Overall  from what I could find  I think that Lady Gaga is most likely an ISFP  as I believe she is Fi dominant with a balanced Se Ni axis  Also  for anyone interested  I have more quotes listed on my site  which is currently a work in progress ,isfp
Imagine thinking Lady Gaga of all people doesn t use Fi or Se  like if you re going to propose another type at least make it coherent  Inferior Se my ass,isfp
She is a very interesting example of an ISFP with well developed Ni  This makes her more concerned about political issues and helps write songs and create art with quite symbolic meaning  She is definitely a Fi user  constantly struggling to maintain her individuality and personal style in an environment which pressures her to conform  She is deliberately eccentric in her fashion and art  as a way of expressing her unique identity   Fi Se ,isfp
I think she s INFJ because she is very deeply person  dedicated to her career and very political,isfp
Finally watched her Vogue retrospective on her past looks  Man if that ain t Fi Se Ni at work whew   I can see why people thought INFJ  but there s just no way this woman has inferior Se  Like none at all  I m sorry INFJs  Se informs her Fi so deeply   INFJs are not the only people who can be weird and deep and visionary about art  This stereotype has to stop lmao it s getting out of control  ,isfp
This might get massively downvoted but I m here for it B  LEGGOO   As y all know  the main message of her art has always been to be whoever the   you want and never apologise for being yourself  Her main focus is on openly expressing her identity and additionally sending a message in every single thing she does  being transgressor and scandalous is her indistinguishable trademark  She s highly vocal regarding her opinions and beliefs and doesn t give a damn about what the audience might think of her nor if she s in tune with the tribe s values  even if that causes social rejection but I mean  who cares  Not her ofc  She unapologetically lives her extra life according to what she personally stands for and doesn t adjust herself for anybody because c mon guys  she s fking Lady Gaga  she breaks the standard    This woman CAN T LIVE w o being true to herself and she s the first celebrity who will raise her voice and fingerpoint to anything that breaks w her ideals  She has also always spoken up about issues which are taboo and has used art as a tool to ultimately create a reaction to the audience  She purposely seeks to produce discomfort to the people to earn attention thus visibility to the causes she fights for  in this way it generates controversy and encourages an open discussion regarding the topic   What s more  she s insanely talented when it comes to articulate feelings and fomenting the creation of certain emotional reactions to others by the way she expresses her natural gifts  Yes  a Fe user would instigate an emotional reaction by their verbose but in case of Lady Gaga is literally EVERYTHING regarding her expression  the way she is  how she presents herself  her body language  her performances  her aesthetic and looks    her whole existence   She doesn t seek to be seen as a mere symbol that represents an idea to create a movement for the people as a xNFJ would  She wants ALL her persona to be symbolic and representative of everything she personally defends   Just bcs she has a fundraiser and cares deeply about people doesn t make someone a Fe user  however  I do recognise that her Ni glows but there s no way in hell that s her most valued function  Compare her with Sevdaliza  she s way more abstract  existential and eerie than Lady Gaga   She s extremely versatile and doesn t get stuck with one way to embody her art  She needs to make art a new experience every time  not only because she appreciates the nominal value of the sensory idea but more importantly because forcing herself to constantly get out of her comfort zone helps to shape and expand her identity so she has the necessity to put into test her skills and get involved in unfamiliar areas to see how well she performs and how she s able to respond to it    It s true that her aesthetic is generally highly symbolic but it s only when she promotes a movement  not because she has generated an idea of her own and creates hidden symbols in her videos or outfits to let people capture the abstract meaning she intends to manifest   To put everything together  she uses Se as a mean and takes Ni as a booster to reach Fi as her ultimate goal  that  and she speaks italian  english and fluent emotion ,isfp

As an ISFP I believe she is      an UNHEALTHY ISFP,isfp
I ll gather more information  come back and type her  if you guys think SP people can t do       check out Chloe in Life is Strange and Eren in AoT  you can underestimate ISxP s Ne but please never underestimate their Ni  they re the sum of everything they know and experience  deep understanding makes them even more powerful  but sadly  not many of them are capable of that,isfp
this is totally not relating over the arguments here  but what I ve noticed is that I ve seen a lot of ISFP vs INTJ and I realized that they are my top   s and   s along with ISTP ,isfp
I will say this  people need to stop using the  inferior function equals weak function  argument for Sylvie  She very obviously has strong and well developed Se and Te usage  and with the consensus being that she uses Fi Ni  both ISFP and INTJ should be plausible typings for her character  It comes down to whether she approaches things first with her Fi framework or her Ni process ,isfp
Ignoring the ISFP vs INTJ arguments  why are there so many votes for  w   Wasn t her entire motivation based on her anger  Just because she was  running away  doesn t mean she was a cp   she wasn t driven by fear at all  I mean  E s aren t dumbasses  they have the ability to run away when they realise that the odds are stacked against them ,isfp
Great  another case of Sasuke Effy Eren Griffith ThomasShelby Light Madara Levi where INTJ voters cry about  LOOPS AND GRIPS  like they re the most fragile and special living beings on this planet that randomly goes into  Grips and loops  all the time under any amount of stress  Even if  loops and grips  are viable way to type a character  it should be used EXTREMELY situational  like when a character going through severe stress  I m talking APOCALYPTIC level of stress when someone and their cognitive functions have all FAILED to handle the situation  therefore the TEMPORALLY LASH OUT using their least prefered function aka Inferior function  They are not even their real self in those moment anymore   It s not a god damn life style that you can maintain for years and years like these INTJ voters have always claim  Furthermore  EVEN if  loops and grips  is viable to type character  what makes ALL INTJ characters not actually ISFP Te grip and WHATEVER LOOPS            Omg Ive been using so much Se   I am must be in Se grip  typical INTJ    so quirky omgg lol      No you re not an INTJ under Se grip  you re a f cking mistyped xFxP  And if you re truly an INTJ under permanent Se grip  go see a psychologist  NOW   At this rate lets just say every single ISFP ENTJ characters to be INTJ under  loops and grips   I am an INTJ under Se grips now  All people in Quadra Gamma  ESFP INTJ ENTJ ISFP  are INTJs under Ni fi loops now   This pattern of INTJ going around typing every single cool character  oftenly ISFP ENTJ because were in the same quadra and share the same functions  sometimes even ISTP and ISTJ fall prey to because theyre cool guy introverts  is quite clear if you have browsed PDB for more than   minutes  and it s disgusting and they should be called out for it   Disgusting and dishonest behavior and I ve had it  Stop this idiotic nonsense at once  Show proof of Ni dom or shut your mouth ,isfp

It seems to me that she is a positive character Who is interested in learning something new and her care for friends is very interesting to observe and empathize with her,isfp

I remember the scary days when wonder egg priority just came out and people were typing her as INFP   ,isfp
I m still new to this function and enneagram sorta thing  However  INFP or ISFP  I ma try my best how to explain  w   w    As said by many  her common phrase is  NOW I M MAD    right  Well the reason why she s not an  w   is because most   s with   wing don t hold back  while   s with a   wing might feel insecure and ashamed for lashing out or being angry   The reason why I believe  w   w  is because  w  s tend to have difficulty focusing on real life problems  unlike  w  s who usually ignore real life problems and try to hide it  as seen with her problems of heterochromia  she hides one eye underneath her bang     All in all  this is why I believe she is an  w  and not  w  or  w   And point me out if I made any mistakes  I can take criticism  ,isfp
So I see here that many people think that she is an INFP as according to many arguments here  she is quite familiarity and consistency seeking in life  quite against changes sometimes and wanting to stay in her comfort zone which even I agree is an indication of Si  Also her physical abilities and fighting skills aren t the reason why she does Se as well  Nor does it mean being impulsive although yeah high Se users are generally like that since they have inferior Ni   However the main difference here becomes that Se Ni axis is always quite trusting of their empirical observations  just trying to reach the depth of the perspective which has the  most yield in the here and now    Therefore in ISFPs  although the Se wants them to trust what lies in the present moment as it is wanting to understand and take things at face value  their Ni just cannot help but want to look beyond what is physical  trying to conjecture the meaning and the conclusion of all that they perceive  trying to connect it all to some central point    What I personally saw in Ai was exactly this  as she doesn t like to accept things at face value and her Ni can really at times deviate her from what is just visible to her in the moment in understanding the hidden theme behind it instead of focussing on looking at the situation from various angles and trying to find the truth behind all of it ,isfp
Natsuki is the type of artist ISFP is going to do an analysis of her based on her poems throughout history  Poem of the day      You know what I heard about Amy  Amy likes spiders  Disgusting  elusive  hairy  ugly spiders  And that s why I m not her friend  Amy has a beautiful singing voice  I heard her singing my favorite love song  Every time she sang the chorus  My heart beat to the rhythm of the words  But she likes spiders  That s why I m not her friend  Once  I hurt my leg  Amy helped me and took me to the infirmary  I tried not to let her touch me  She likes spiders  so her hands are probably disgusting  That s why I m not her friend  Amy has many friends  I always see her talking to people  She probably talks about spiders  What if her friends start liking spiders too  That s why I m not her friend  It doesn t matter if she has other hobbies  It doesn t matter if she does it in private  It doesn t matter if it doesn t hurt anyone  It s disgusting  She is disgusting  The world is better without spider lovers     It doesn t matter if she has other hobbies  It doesn t matter if she does it in private  It doesn t matter if it doesn t hurt anyone  It s disgusting  She s disgusting  The world is better without spider lovers   Introverted Feeling   Here the message that Natsuki gives in this part of the poem is about the prejudice that people suffer for their private activities  i e  the poem is about  freedom  to do your hobbies without judgment    Fi Te     It doesn t matter if it doesn t hurt anyone    basically what she says translating is  if it doesn t hurt anyone why can t she  Amy  do it    Natsuki herself says that the poem is a representation of a  jerk  person  Natsuki uses what she has experienced represented in the poem    Here she uses her own experience to create a poem using a kind of metaphor but based on her own experience  The           represents her friends in Natsuki and Monika s story in the DDLC   You can see that Natsuki was bullied by her friends for liking manga and she represents her friends as the           in the poem and herself as the character  Amy     it is worth remembering that Natsuki made a poem very similar to Yuri s  Yuri is an INFP  which shows the similarities of two dominant Fi users  but there is a disagreement between the two in a certain part of the game because Yuri used a more metaphorical language and even more difficult to understand while Natsuki liked a simpler language to make it easier for the reader to understand  yuri says  Look how many incredible words there are in our language  not to use them would not only be a waste but also stupid    Ne   ja natsuki says  A poem is made to convey a message to the reader  if the reader can t understand the message  what s the point of a poem    remembering that there are many adaptations in the language  so the version you are playing may be a little different   in this part of the game it is visible Natsuki s  Se  and Yuri is clearly using more her  Ne  at this point  It turns out that Natsuki is not ignoring her tertiary Ni she values her Ni so much that her poems are metaphors  however natsuki wants to convey the message in a simpler way so that it is easy to understand    Se aux Ni tert   Poem day      Your mind is so full of problems and fears That diminishes your charm over the years But today I have a special place A beach for us to go to  A shore that s beyond your sight A sea that sparkles with a brilliant light The walls of your mind will melt In front of the sunny glow  I ll be the shore that washes away your cares I ll be the beach you dream of each day I ll be the beach that makes your heart skip In a way  your mind left you long ago  Let s bury your heavy thoughts in a pile of sand Bathe in the sun s rays and hold my hand Wash your insecurities in the salty sea And let me see you shine  Leave your memories in a trail of footprints Set yourself free on my windy sail And remember the reasons why you re wonderful When you press your lips against mine  I ll be the beach that washes away your cares I ll be the beach that you dream of each day I ll be the beach that makes your heart skip In a way  your mind left you long ago  But if you leave me by your side Your own beach  your own escape You will learn to love yourself again    In poem   her Fi Se was visible but let s analyze the poem from day     Wash your insecurities in the salty sea    You will learn to love yourself again      Your mind is so full of problems and fears It diminishes your charm over the years    Let s bury your heavy thoughts in a pile of sand   All   sentences are about self love  Fi  and the poem uses the beach as a metaphor as Natsuki herself says  there is no place  better  than the beach  beach gives a sense of peace and calm  which makes me think of natsuki as a Fi user  In general this poem uses a metaphorical form but unlike Yuri s for example  this poem is simple and easy to understand  Se aux Ni tert    ,isfp
If you can prove me wrong then do it but she is definitely ISTP  She s got that Ti classic snarky attitude and that Se  play with me  side too ,isfp

for everyone voting     i ll put this here  see  fixes are about how u deal with things  for example  the shame triad        and    are how u deal with shame the fear triad        and    are how u deal with fear  and the anger triad        and    are how u deal with anger fixes do not always correlate with the enneagram s core fears and desires  bc that s not their core enneagram type  that s one of their fixes   while natsuki may express fear of losing her friends  that doesn t rlly mean she has a   fix but could also be some of her enneagram   as well   for natsuki  she seems to expressive of her anger  which is      s express their anger and  s don t rlly express their anger   natsuki gets into too many arguments and is too aggressive for a   fix,isfp
okay i just want to say natsuki is a perfect depiction of a   disintegrating into a       also personally i see her having   in her tritype bc honestly i don t really understand when u guys say that she can t have a nine in her tritype bc she outwardly expresses her anger     idk ig i just really see the stubbornness that a lot of nines have and generally wanting to keep everyone happy and content  i get that she s argumentative but i feel like deep down she just wants her friends to get along  if someone disagrees and could explain it to me  that would be great       ,isfp

I watched the movie some days ago and she striked me as one of the most painfully obvious ESTPs to exist  She s artistic and expressive so what  She s also very opportunistic  moraly ambiguous and manipulative  The ISFP votes are breaking my brain,isfp
she s very self focused  dont care what others think of her  moslty tries to look like so   express her emotions through art and pretty defensive thats pretty Fi and i think her rebelliousness shines through her Se  I legit see no Ne or tert Fe   tert Fe in ExTPs aren t developed as how others say  i agree  but the tert function will still be noticeable it s just that is unhealthy used bad  dont know how to control it    i think her tert Ni is seen while the whole revenge plan towards Regina Fi Ni  influenced by her feelings and what it meant to her  and i really dont see how her Si would be inferior rather than Te  she never even question if that is the RIGHT thing to do and jumps right to what she values as the only truth   thats only okay when i say it     FiSe   Please explain where would u strongly see just any of these opposite functions  NeTiFeSi  i would try to condradict it  ,isfp

I genuinely don t understand the ISFP votes  Think of it  if she were an ISFP  she wouldn t waste her time doing all this vendetta against Regina   MBTI wise  she is unhealthy  Janis was in the Si grip because of that middle school thing  until there was a hope to have a revenge against Regina  And there are many signs of her ENTP functions    Fe  When helped Cady  a confused new student  to understand each clique at school  Janis didn t tell who was who or how they personally related to her  but she just  realistically and comically  identified and grouped each clique according to their social standing   How is that even Fi  That s closer to Fe and Ti   Ne Ti  When she analyzed the weak spots of Regina and created the strategy against her  that s her Introverted Thinking in the work  Her strategy  with Cady  was so out of the box  and they did not go against Regina directly  that they managed to catch Regina off guard  Both of them did  not  exhibit Ni in their strategy ,isfp

Does anyone have an actual argument for core    Doesn t seem right  While an unhealthy   might become possessive and controlling  they re more confident and self reliant  They wouldn t feel a need to get back at someone behind the scenes  in fact they d probably just see this as dumb and immature  If they have a problem dislike something in someone  Regina would definitely hear about it   An   would just call you out to your face  They don t play that dumb  passive aggressive behind the scenes      lol  The issue is sx  s can resemble  s  but only at surface level   s would be more likely to cover their hurt with anger and compensate their hurt by seeking revenge  which is obvious Janice is doing    s won t be at the the mercy of injustice being weak  They ll address it immediately to show that they re the ones on top  In fact  Janice plotting to get revenge at Regina based on her personal grudges humiliation is almost described by BC sx   subtype description perfectly  Read a comparision between  s and  s anywhere and they ll all say  s wouldn t dwell in something so petty and would get over it  Sx   doesn t suit Janice at all either  See the sx   description for yourself   ,isfp
just watch her crazy dance scene in Funny Face  literally screams ISFP   love her sm ,isfp
In Model G terms  I would think LSI HN AO Shift to EII makes more sense  probably with additional Fi accentuation  than a pure EII  EIIs are less likely to aspire to become famous  such as through acting  due to their peripheral nature and Fe control  I also think her emotional display seems more role playing than anything ,isfp
 There is more to sex appeal than just measurements  I don t need a bedroom to prove my womanliness  I can convey just as much sex appeal  picking apples off a tree or standing in the rain  strong Se   Ni     The most important thing is to enjoy your life to be happy it s all that matters      Fi   Se  Regardless of anything  what is most important is the NOW      The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears  the figure that she carries  or the way she combs her hair   Se  she is definitely not Se blind      Your heart just breaks  that s all  But you can t judge or point fingers  You just have to be lucky enough to find someone who appreciates you   Se living sensory as is   Ni personal concept to guide the individual towards the future  I dont get the INFP votes  if you are a new voter go to the filter votes to  Best  i think  And y all can see  D more detailed and well thought arguement on why AH is ISFP ,isfp
Audrey was driven by Fi  motivated by her Ni  and Se made her a grounded and realistic person  she was a person of action  INFPs  Ne processes Fi in more abstract  wider ways  They may have many ideas  but have difficulty to put them into action  ISFPs Se makes them more physical and practical  and they have more presence  There s no way she is a Se blind  INxPs tend to look more awkward and less in touch with whats happening around them ,isfp
Frankly  Audrey Hepburn was recognized for her physique  people always report how she could simply steal the show she was very striking for everyone even if without intention of it  even people who criticize her as an actress and singer claim that in fact she was very striking and precise in her gestures and behavior  the Tertiary Ni was visible giving the Se subjectivity and the ethereal  it is a fact that the characteristic of Audrey that left her marked in society until today was her enormous stage presence and her person  the INFPs have Ne and Si as an auxiliary and tertiary  people perceive them behind the abstract and mainly for ideas  Si gives more consistency to the fleeting Ne  is very possible that in the physical they go unnoticed and have to work hard on something  if you are going to collect descriptions from many INFPs and even INTPs you will notice that their descriptions seem out of touch and strange to the current moment  Audrey had no problem with  compare with another very important actress Marilyn Monroe she was at the time an opposite symbol to that of Audrey Hepburn but note the immense resemblance of the two in the way they were striking in the eyes of other people  this is exactly what made both of them so remarkable  all this has been said in so many comments  even in her humanitarian actions Audrey was always focused on the present and not on an idea  her vision was always to enjoy  today  but be open to what  fate  could provide by adapting  please leave stereotypes out of the vote   ,isfp
 Choose the day  Enjoy it to the fullest  The day as it comes  People like them learn  The past  I think  would classify me as covering the present  and I don t want to spoil any of that by envisioning a future     Audrey Hepburn,isfp

Her eyebrows are done in this photo  Only Se users care about eyebrows  Could only be an ISFJ,isfp
All this is impressive  it is already more than proven that Audrey Hepburn is a Se user  her quotes and insights involved living fully with a futuristic abstract conciliation  Se Ni   I would also like to communicate how beautiful it is to imagine that two women as remarkable as AH and Marilyn Monroe are ISFPs both are associated with literally opposite things yet both carry similarities  don t forget that despite the many differences ISFPs are still dominant Fi and have Te as an inferior function like the INFP  we often think that we are seeing a certain auxiliary or tertiary function but it is actually just the stronger side of the Fi Te axis ,isfp
She is not expressing her values for the sake of an IDEA that it will help people  She literally helps people  physically which is very literal and practical    She is literally an Se Ni axis user  Her Se is always engaging with things as they come  she does not do things in the bigger picture  How she can inspire  she can support through her humanitarian works  Ne  rather she is putting on actual work  She is reaching out to children in different places that needs assistance because she had watched in TV before how terrible their situation is  She sees the problem as it is and then tries to help immediately   Her Ni is very symbolic  When she acts on things she would later understand the universal understanding of her values  On how her efforts became something meaningful  become something greater  She always have this abstract impression of her own actions and values which is how people would think is Ne but Ne is association of many things of one  thus possibility  novelty  potentiality  ideas   Ni is understanding of a whole ,isfp
i am an INFP and zuko is one of my favorite characters ever  as much as i d love to be type twins with him  this guy has NO ne and obvious se ni ,isfp
Man has negative Ne  he s so stubborn and close minded it isn t even funny ,isfp
Not the  k  INFP votes      where tf you see ne lmfao his ni is VERY obvious stop this bs ,isfp
He s an obvious INFP because he s so FiNe  But without any more jokes in advance and I sincerely ask you to read everything that I am going to write without judging and without putting downvote just to see that I vote for INFP read without prejudice and you will see how my masterful  perfect and magnificent argument changes your mind and with time the concession returns to its original state muahahahhaha  Fi dominant  Zuko comes from the Fi re nation the element he uses is the Fi re he was the Fi re prince and then he becomes the Fi re Lord  see  Fi is everywhere  Auxiliary Ne  At Lake Laogai he said that he would have figured something out  Do you know who else has figured something out  Einstein a user of Ne came up with something about physics or mathematics or something like that idk man don t look at me that way I didn t study physics I studied psychology as you can see  the point is that Zuko and Einstein have figured something out so both are Ne users  Tertiary Si   He has memory  What  I told the truth the users of Si  they actually have a good memory  that you never read my dude Carl  well SHAME ON YOU      Inferior Te  Zuko does not like his uncle s Iroh Te a does not respect Te a he is tired of Te a and he is terrible doing Te a  The brat almost makes his uncle vomit when he served him that horrible Te a so disgusting  you know what  SHAME ON HIM TOO      Well that was all thanks for reading and please fill out this comment with upvotes so that it is in top comments because it deserves it I really reallyu really try to do it in the best possible way  JOIN ME CAUSE  WE FIGHT SENSOR BIAS TOGETHER    ,isfp
Why sp   He honestly fits more in sp  descriptions than sp  ,isfp
How did he have Ne again  You can t just barely use your aux function ,isfp
FiNe looks like someone who has their own set of morals and beliefs  they will be open to the morally best ways to do things  it is also a healthy INFP  Fi Si loop is apart of an unhealthy INFP  which is Zuko at the beginning of avatar  He was fuelled by anger and hatred towards the avatar  due to his past  He was so stuck in his belief that ending the avatar would make his father love him again  Fi Si loop  as he could only think about what his father said   Later on in the series  Zuko had character development  wanted to find a new source of his fire bending other than rage and anger  which proves his Si   if u disagree i d love to hear why  just pls do not claim i have  intuitive bias  bc i genuinely think he has been mistyped as a result of horrible INFP stereotypes and people don t understand that INFPs can be motivated by rage too  and ISFP has a stereotype of being angry,isfp
Ive not decided fully on his mbti but I don t think he s a    though he has a   fix   fi dom  s are prone to be paralyzed by negative emotions a so  is more likely to express it outwardly but just simply feeling a lot of negative emotions itself or being dramatic about them isn t a   thing  it s part of     type description   Hyunjin has even mentioned on two kids room he d rather not go down some rabbit holes bc he doesn t want to face certain thoughts  That s different from  s going there and living there pretty much  struggling to get in touch with reality and action  Hyunjin on the other hand is more attuned to different experiences  different hobbies  actions  working on his skill sets  rather than exploring different emotions  identities  understanding of the self  etc  also  he doesn t seem to identifying with suffering as a   would    Additionally  he fits the     type description really well          Direct and intuitive    Most independent  original and creative    Can be moody  Most non conforming  and intense    sexual     is a very flamboyant type               is the most in need of freedom  This is the messenger archetype that feels they have a message to impart and wants the freedom to explore themselves and their external worlds  WIth   in charge it s an extremely hard to pin down type  that typically has no problems expressing the flamboyancy    This tritype is the most creative type on the enneagram regardless of which type is in charge  This creativity may or may not have artistic talent but always has a sense of aesthetics  All three crave authenticity  depth and individuality     This type is intuitive  innovative and straight forward      wants to be original  inspirational and self possessed  A cutting edge tracker of both internal and external worlds      are unconventional  passionate master of solutions  Outwardly  they are confident but inwardly they are emotionally vulnerable ,isfp
This will probably be the last comment I make on here since I think this page is pretty doomed  as people come up with different arguments and consider too many things for him and have overcomplicated typing this dude to a point where it is indiscernible to most people now  I have typed him as ISTP over a year ago and still see it and it isn t complicated for me to see  I won t use specific examples because I can t be bothered to get them anymore  this is all based on what I know about him  he s my ultimate bias so I have been watching all his content and keeping up with him on a daily basis since   I think Hyunjin this year especially has become more closed off with himself for obvious reasons  He s not as active as he used to be  he barely goes live  and he mostly messages through bubble now  It s definitely not the same as pre hiatus  but I think he s going through a period where he still has to be extra careful about everything    Hyunjin is very in touch with his emotions  yes  This is still due to being an sx dominant type    Sexual  s have a fantastical air about them  almost like they view the world in a romanticized sense  An sx sp especially will be a hopeless romantic and attracted to other people in a particular way  they are so blind so this means they will be less attracted to groups of people and will look to individually connect with others  hence why they end up being hopeless romantics  They want to form deep  meaningful connections with other people  so being open and speaking about deep topics comes naturally to them and is what they prefer  This is why whenever Hyunjin speaks it always sounds poetic  also due to tert Ni  as Ni often prefers to express itself through symbolism   A type   sx sp will also be addicted to the feeling of euphoria that comes to connecting with people through means of art and performance  this is why Hyunjin is addicted to his craft  The   you might see in him is possibly in his tritype  or just from how similar type  s and  s can be  as a type   myself I also can see a lot of   traits in me even though I don t have any   in my typing   Type  s are outgoing  witty  and overall positive people  I don t understand how anyone is seeing   in him  I guess because of how  emotional  he comes off  but as a type   sx myself I am also extremely emotional and it has nothing to do with Fi or    I m literally Fi blind     but the reason people are confused or don t entirely see all traits of a   is because he doesn t have it  Maybe he could in the tritype still but I personally don t see any    Hyunjin doesn t strike me as a person who would rather dwell in the negatives and let those emotions boil  on the contrary  he always tries to stay positive and move grow past things  He has always been the type of person to look forward  Not only this but he is always looking for stimulation and jumps from project to project and is interested in developing many different skills  Type  s are fast learners and good at this stuff  He picks up any skill with ease  but only if he s truly interested in it and finds it fun  He will not hesitate to take risks and finds it important to always try new things  Basically  he is only interested in things he likes and does things he likes  He s a type   fullstop  As for his wing  I think   is the most appropriate  but I don t see his   be strong enough to be his core like how I see    So he is a  w  sx sp    As for his MBTI  if you have trouble picturing him as Te inferior  it s because he isn t  If you can t see him being an Se dominant either  it s because he isn t  I know people often struggle to see him being Ti dominant and Fe inferior  especially maybe other IXTPs on here who are  s  but there is a big difference between a Ti dom who is a core   and one who is a core    Everything I explained above can probably make you see the difference  He is still an ISTP because cognitively it s what makes the most sense  ISTPs will also be attracted to always trying new things and skill building  Ti and Fi are also more similar than people might think  both are individualistic and introspective  The reason I have never seen Hyunjin as an Fi dom is because he hasn t shown any of its core traits  which are the emphasis on self identity and strong core values  As he gets older he is growing more of a backbone when it comes to believing in his own thoughts  which makes no sense if he were an Fi dom bc Fi is associated so much with values precisely because they feel very strongly about them  Hyunjin has never been like this    he bases everything on what he absorbs externally  on other people s opinions  or what he deems appropriate  which how I see it  is basically how he thinks things make sense to him   That s the basis of Ti  what makes sense to an individual  which is subjective to everyone  Fe inferior is seen in how he can be a social chameleon  tries to appease to others  worries too much about what people think of him  sometimes        ,isfp
The nth day of me getting confused with why does he have a   or   fix,isfp
There s no way you guys are serious about the   fix  I m actually surprised it has many votes too    I see absolutely ZERO   in him,isfp
genuinely can someone give me examples of his inferior Te   srs,isfp
i m torn between  w  and  w  but my question is where are yall seeing the   fix,isfp
okay beside the fi ti debate what do you guys think about his temperaments   phleg san doesnt seem right to me but i might be wrong  just wanted to see the arguments about it tbh,isfp
before reading this i will add that this argument is parted in three comments since is very explained    so i want to revise my arguments a bit since when i wrote my first argument  and it was   months ago   i was conviced about him being ISTP and i m still conviced  but since these few months i had improving my knowledge about mbti and recently i get in drama because of what i stated about part of other options voters  because i see every day what s going on and recently there is very heated war over votes and one options arguments overshadowing these of other options to the point that new voters can see only one option and it s not good   so i will remind the differences between ti and fi and common things that i think aren t clarified much  so it would not suprising  if the comment would be in parts because i want to explain in complex way and with used external resources    the first thing why recently so many ISFP votes came is probably fact that hyunjin s new hobby is a fi like  but they clarified when he begun to like drawing  no  he begun to like drawing not that long time ago  about only one year from what i see  before he wasn t that much interested in art  so that s why probably him using fi doesn t sit well  at least from what i see  i understand that some people can t see ti in him for many different reasons  but what i said in other comment  it s most realistic option for me   because also from what i had seen  i don t think his emotions are mature  rather his emotions expression is kinda childlike  from what i had seen he is so dramatic and it s not fi for sure   also what i had found this is what is said about ISTP usage of fe in one page about mbti theory and i will compare    For ISTPs and INTPs alike  their Fe is rather naive and childlike  They may be easily moved by cheesy romantic comedies or sappy love songs  anything that incites their subconscious Fe emotions  They can also be easy targets for  love at first sight  sorts of infatuation  They may be particularly susceptible to being wooed by Feeling types  especially FJs   who can bypass their typical channels of logic and appeal directly to ISTPs  less conscious Fe  Because of the inferior position of their Fe  ISTPs struggle to intentionally contact or understand their emotions  It s not they never experience emotions  but only that their emotions seem to have a mind of their own  coming and going as they please  So even if ISTPs are aware of what emotions are appropriate for a given situation  they often do not  feel  them at the time  engendering a sense of awkwardness or discomfort in emotional situations     and when i saw this part  immediately i saw how hyunjin is like  and it s probably also a thing which confuse voters who aren t sure about his type  also i think about part about experiencing emotions since many people spread  cold and unemotional ISTP  stereotype since any type can experience emotions  but people are so different to this point that even people of the same mbti type can experience it differently       ,isfp
Fi users view their opinions and values as their assets and they re often very excited cherish their opinions a lot  While Ti users express their opinions in a more milder way that the opinions are not their assets  Does this help ,isfp
Since there s barely any arguments about his enneagram I wanted to share my own reasoning here   I think the aspect that s more similar to   in his personality is his ambition and restlessness  He said a few times that he has a hard time just settling down and he s always on the run and has talked abt issues he s had with orderliness   I think the major difference between   and   is that the former emphasizes their pain and seeks for a savior and the latter prefers to not feel sorry for themselves and go after what they need  He also loves spontaneity and adventure and the intensity he puts on everything he does reminds me of a sexual     So  i think he has a lot of similar aspects to type    but some also don t quite match  like he does put a lot of emphasis in his self expression and he doesn t push his bad feelings away  he s extremely self aware  but he doesn t like seeing himself as a victim and he also seems to feel guilty about showing his feelings to other people  he s also annoyingly optimistic  easygoing and doesn t really dwell on stuff  contrary to    since they usually extend and exaggerate their feelings    At first i was convinced he was a   because of how goal oriented he is and because he seeks success  but three s generally want to be seen as successful for external approval  because they want to feel valuable  which is something I didn t see that much in him  but I can t really be sure   s are also kinda unaware of their own feelings and want to shut them down for the sake of their performance  especially negative feelings because they don t want others to see their flaws  They generally don t know what they really want since they re more concerned with achievement than their personal interests  So there s a LOT of contradictions here which makes it difficult to type him but for now i m thinking  w   at first  w  seemed more probable but it wouldn t make sense with either Fe or Te in the inf  Idk if that s even possible but maybe with the two types together they would kind of balance each other out  which would explain the contradictions  For now this is what seems more probable to me  since i don t see   or   at all in him so idk how   would fit   He could be a   in the direction of integration     considering he s healthy  i suppose  it would make sense why he has some opposing characteristics to    he s very similar to type   sometimes too  It also fits with the direction of disintegration     which would explain why he s so sensitive to external views and dependent on other people sometimes ,isfp
i know i just posted a whole thing about her iv stack but this is for the   vs   debate  she detaches from her pain rather than indulging it  as a   would   she has given up on the world  so she seeks fun distractions and ways to numb herself out  so instead  her pain anger leaks out when she can t keep a lid on it  especially when it is triggered by the threat of abandonment   and she briefly lashes out before coming back to herself and feeling guilty over it  this is incredibly    she blames herself for her negative emotions episodes where she has lashed out rather than reframing everyone else as the issue and indulging in self pity and victimhood as much as an unhealthy   would  she can t stay angry at the people who have left her  and misses them  though this makes her feel weak  as evidenced by the beginning of  im just your problem  before bonnie criticizes her  as well as  maybe im the one whos nuts  in reference to continuing to pursue a friendship with simon even though he can t remember her  she used her imagination heavily to cope with her loneliness as a child by pretending things were better  ex  the  friends  she makes at the shelter in obsidian  hambo   this is her coping with abandonment and is indicative of positive outlook triad  likewise  she s highly attached to sentimental about her belongings not only hambo but also her axe bass  this is because she s using them to replace her attachments to people  hambo represents simon  who gifted it to her  and the bass represents her father  as the axe is a family heirloom   she is wayward and refuses to do the necessary self introspection to  grow up  until bonnie is able to help her do this  ex  all of stakes   when it comes to things outside of herself  she is quite perceptive  and notices the patterns cycles that repeat in the world around her  however  she feels powerless to change or stop them  so she gives up on her beliefs   i just lost track of my moral code   and stagnates for literally hundreds of years  she isn t shown to be particularly bothered by her lack of growth or ambition  except when it means other people  bonnie  hunson  view her negatively  she feels bad for not being able to be what they want her to be and wishes they would accept her as she is  she easily internalizes images other people have of her and plays them up rather than exploring who she truly is  her whole monster complex   she stays in relationships that are unfitting for her out of fear of being alone  ash   and she struggles when she feels people can t really see her  bonnie  hunson   a   would revel in being different unique mysterious difficult to understand unconventional a loner  not resent it   she fears abandonment and separation way more than she fears a lack of identity or uniqueness  it is her driving motivation as a character   when she is happy  she s very chill  laid back  easygoing  kind  and fun loving  even when healthy  a   would be more indulgent of negativity and focused on what is lacking in the world around them  they would also still tend to provoke others and have dramatic emotional displays rather than be peaceful and accepting   its important to remember both  s and  s can be imaginative  creatively inclined  deep  and seek emotional authenticity  both can feel misunderstood  but a   is the one who is more likely to resent this rather than own it  a   desires to be seen  even though they re getting in their own way  its also important to remember  s are a gut type  and the stereotype that they are always meek and unassuming is misinformed  they can actually be quite intense  especially with an   wing  double reactive fixes  and an so blind iv stack  whether you believe she s sp sx or sx sp   as well as fi dom and limbic   honestly she might even be more  w  than   but tritype order is fairly inconsequential,isfp
reading the entirety of chestnut s chapter on enneagram    i m almost certain marceline is an   rather than a   ,isfp
i originally wrote this as a response to the person below arguing in favor of sp sx  but then i saw multiple people had raised the same question  plus  i put so much effort into it that i d prefer it be a new thread and not get buried lol  hope that s okay   anyway  if you re typing purely according to chestnut s definitions  sure  i can see sp dom  but some  myself included  question the validity of her  and naranjo s  literature on IVs based on newer conflicting research  personally  i prefer this source  https   www enneagrammer com instinct stacking  i recommend learning the instincts first  before attempting to understand how they influence different core types  also  early enneagram literature had a fundamental misunderstanding of core  s to begin with  but that s a topic for another time lol  in my opinion  marceline does exhibit the sx  tendency to  merge   that is  even if she is not spending all her time literally attached to someone  she unconsciously bases her identity around her individual relationships with others  she is independent and a loner towards the beginning of the show not by choice or preference  but rather because she has been shunned by humans due to her demonic heritage as well as  from her perspective  rejected  abandoned  or neglected by all of the important people in her life  hunson  her mother  simon  bonnie   pretending she prefers to be alone is purely a defense mechanism  and one that s pretty transparent  in actuality  she tends to overprioritize and even define herself by her relationships when she does have them  she can be heavily affected by others to the point of losing herself within her relationship with them and ignoring red flags for the sake of not being alone  ex  ash  or otherwise letting them warp her sense of self   if you see me as a monster  i must be one    rather than maintaining greater boundaries like a sp dom would  especially a w  sp dom   a sp  would tend to withdraw because they perceive others as a threat to the prioritization of their personal needs comforts health and general pursuit of homeostasis as a way to maintain their inner peace  instead  marceline is shown to ignore sp needs in pursuit of intense personal relationships  despite pretending she doesn t need them   she literally voluntarily risks her own life hunting vampires to protect humans  not necessarily just out of a strong moral code  but more because seeks to prove she is one of them or can be accepted by them  though this is arguably more so  it s definitely not sp  basically  she cannot help but move towards others and seek out this person who will finally understand her not abandon her or see her as a monster  even though she has been disappointed by others countless times in the past  she s deeply lonely and desires to win her loved ones back  and get them to finally  see  or understand her  despite the fact that seeking others  love and approval directly threatens her  tough girl  ego image  however  her desperation for love results in a heightened emotional intensity and fragility  at odds with her chill nature  that sabotages her  and then she pretends it was on purpose to avoid the pain of rejection  aka maintain inner peace   she also just has the unconscious intense  playful  passionate  flirtatious  occasionally more aggressive energy of a sx dom  further magnified by   wing     intended to attract the people they desire  or repulse those they do not  look at her edgier fashion sense  emotionally wrought musical performances  her teasing of finn and jake upon meeting them  and her behavior around bonnie when they re broken up  when she wants someone but feels rejected by them  aka bonnie   or simply isn t interested in them  beyond as a source of entertainment and validation   she takes the offensive  messing with people  pushing their boundaries  attempting to provoke them  etc  sp  or so  dom  s would not be quite as outwardly volatile testy unprovoked   outside of the realm of relationships  she also just seeks out intense and risky experiences  roaming the land of ooo  slaying the vampires  touring in a band  riding wolves with finn  the stories implying she dragged bonnie on various adrenaline inducing escapades  etc  whereas a sp  would be more of a homebody and dislike being dragged out of their comfort zone  like  for lack of better example  shrek    also relevant to note that the  intense   angry  marceline is her unhealthy self rather than her actual nature personality when healthy and in a positive setting  towards the end she becomes way more like a clich  sx   ie chill lax  lazy domestic  loving  peaceful like she says in obsidian  she s just not angry anymore  bc her sx needs were met by reuniting with bonnie   not      sure of the validity  or lack thereof  of different sources on iv stackings of course  but this is just my personal opinion based on experiences and  well  being sx  ,isfp
I think Marceline s IV should be sp sx  Sexual  s are literally the LEAST assertive of  s according to Chestnut  which is not like Marceline at all  It should have been her second IV  This is the description about Sexual  s    Sexual Nines tend to be very kind  gentle  tender  and sweet  They are the least assertive of the Nines  However  the tenderness they express  like other gestures of caring that come from the personality rather than the real self  can be  to one extent or another  false  More than the other two Nine subtypes  these Nines can have a difficult time locating their own motivation to act in support of their own initiatives  They can even know they want to do something and not be able to do it for a long time  especially if it involves any kind of conflict with others    This is from her book  The Complete Enneagram   Compare this with the description of Self Preservation  s    Self Preservation Nines tend to be active and intuitive  and they express a kind of subtle strength  This is the most  Eight ish  of the three Nine subtypes  Their sense of inertia with regard to taking action places them firmly in the Nine type  so they are unlikely to be mistaken for Eights  but they do have forceful energy  especially in contrast to the Sexual Nine  which is a much less assertive character  Self Preservation Nines have a stronger presence than the other two Nine subtype personalities  and they can be more irritable and stubborn      Doesn t this sound like Marceline more  She can be moody and irritable when something upsets her  assertive when she needs to be but mostly a chill girl  Which makes more sense with her   wing  When she s not with PB she mostly does her own thing  She s pretty independent  so unlike the merging thing that sx  s tend to do ,isfp
why sx sp over sp sx  sx  s are the most passive  s and sp  s are the most assertive  s,isfp

For anyone doubting   core  Sx  s are also the most aggressive  s  nothing like the stereotypes  Marceline prioritizes her inner peace and autonomy more than her security  but she does spiral a number of times and we can see her disintegration to    Her being   and   fix on top of that  which only makes her more reactive under stress  She also Fi dom so yes  she is more emotionally volatile  I m seeing a lot of ISFPs getting typed as   because they re aggressive or defensive  People forget   is an anger based type  especially sx dom and w  would make her a more reactive   ,isfp
i m still learning the kinda flexibility in each functions and that stuff so i may be wrong  but i just watched the pests episode  s  ep   and marcy gave me some Si vibes  in a pretty much stereotypical i must say  when it comes to bonnibel she gets very nostalgic doesn t she  she always brings to the conversation old memories  so i was wondering if that s some Si  her enneagram or just Fi  it s kinda hard to tell to me because i m a fi dom and si tert   i hope someone can help me with that,isfp
as much as i would love to be her i think we can all agree she is ISFP i litterly have no argument for her being an ISTP or thinker,isfp
This is VERY confusing  she uses the function Se a lot  but at the same time it uses the Ne function ,isfp
Edit  ok  now I m confused  like I see the fact that Yashiro has a good taste in fashion  se  and likes popular guys  se  and good at sports  se    so what I was seeing in the connecting the dots might ve been a misconception about Se Ni and Ne  maybe she just has well developed Ni     Now  becuz there was really almost no explanation about in depth Se examples  I m taking everything back but I m NOT deleting this comment  for other confused INFP voters to see          I have the ultimate proof Yashiro ain t an ISFP  she gets along with an ENTP  How does that even technically happen tho lmao  sike  joking aside  I haven t seen even more than ONE explanation about extraverted sensing that isn t just like barely one scene in the entire show  isn t extroverted intuition obvious in Yashiro  True  she s vivicios  highly in tuned with her reactions to her surroundings as well  but she even more constantly think about  what might happen  like THE ENTIRE SHOW   This is why I hate biases        Yes  the INFP stereotypes suit her and she displays extroverted sensing  I mean  who doesn t display it to some extent  especially when they re mentally healthy and not a type    btw   w  INFPs resemble ENFPs more  Might explain how highly animated her reactions are  since she might appear more extroverted   And how about that scene when she tried to get back to the real world  while seeing potential in being alive and the things she can do when she gets old  which is future oriented btw  she was the one to suggest FLYING A REAR CAR TO THE MOON  HOW IS THAT REALISTIC    if that s not Ne  I m biased  And if I m biased  this is a joke and I m completely not partly pissed at social norms   Do you just want me to stay here and never leave this place     Yashiro  chapter     Guessing people s intentions is not Ne PoLR  ladies and gentlemen      and notice that I gave around   examples of Ne in a s i n g l e chapter   Thank you if you ve made it this far  Have a good day holiday  and most importantly don t take this personally     Would be glad to discuss about anyone s disagreement assertively  Everyone could always be wrong  me included    ,isfp

I m so glad she isn t mistyped as INFP  ,isfp
She is actually not ISFP  she is INFP beacuse she is a daydreamer and she often spaces out   I mean I know everyone spaces out but the fact that she overdo it    I think if we think outside the box  I would think that she is actually closer to INFP s personality than ISFP s personality  actually ISFP s has a little of a kuudere tsunderish act  I mean like Eren  Nanase  Taiga  Yuichiro  Sasuke  Ryuko and more  actually I feel like they have a little of a fierce face sometimes and the are so sensetive inside  When I go through the ISFP list I realize that Nene is the only one   that have different personality  So I was suprised  also Kota from my hero academia is a character that has it diffucult to express emotions and acts fiercly  INFP s has dandere kuderish act like Kaneki  Chiaki  Mitsuri  well I think that Nene and Mitsuri are similiar somehow  they acts the same  and the also have the same enneagram type    Ok now I am confused I don t know the difference between S and N because of you guys  Everyone focus on the real world sometimes but the fact that she is allways daydreamer and she doesn t even concenterate in class  There are possibilities that the creator doesn t care less about the mbti and she actually has an INFP personality but he did her think like an ISFP without realizing it doesn t fit her personality  Guys I know what cognitive thing is now but I didn t know that like  s  means si but I am not giving up I still think she is an INFP ,isfp
Sorry to add fuel to the fire for this profile considering some ppl are already arguing for ENFJ  but does anyone have any arguments for ISFP   ESFP  I ve always known she was a pretty strong Fi and Se user  but I don t really know which one is more dominant in her  Also  ik I ve already voted  I just want to be convinced more that she uses Fi over Se,isfp
INFP because artsy  insecure  and lovesick               j,isfp

I ve been watching her interviews  random videos and even the  Light up the Sky   Her Fi Se is so clearly evident  She s clearly in touch with her own values and ideals  Her fashion sense is always trendy and it always connects with her Fi  She always values individuality and self authenticity ,isfp
obviously she s an ISFP  w  but has anyone explained Te inferior ,isfp

Why not ESI in socionics for Jennie   She seems more a gamma quadra than beta  I don t see a lot of fe in her even in socionics and Esi can be very artistic too  She manages to form close bonds with people through Fi despite seeming aloof  she is sensitive to others but express also very well her opinions ,isfp
ISTP because she s the main rapper,isfp
i saw a tiktok saying jennie is an  w  IN WHAT WORLD    ,isfp
Why Flev    Iei fits more with ELFV ,isfp
tiktok  she is an INFP she took    personalities test  me  dying of laugh ,isfp
Best boy  ISFP really sure matches him  Coming from razor and bennett main,isfp
why is he so close to my types omg love this little fella,isfp
Ah yes  the perfect example of Fi dominant  Struggles with expressing his feelings  has undying love for the things he cares about nonetheless  It s just coincidence that we both love wolves  I promise ,isfp
Though he might not know how to express it  he s a Fi for sure  He doesn t understand human emotions very well  yes  But he demonstrates how much he cares about his  Lupical   that being his family  the wolves  his friends and the Traveler   So yeah  Fi ,isfp
Can     voters explain the   fix pls im curious,isfp
can someone explain why the   in his tritype  i can see the   and    but no trace of        would fit more imo  but please do tell your reasoning for that,isfp
i honestly do not see him as an ISFP and here s why  what we know about razor is that he is bad at communicating due to being raised by wolves  he is really connected to family since he learned about taking care of himself and others that he loves and finally in his lines he talks a lot about how he perceive things and how he feels things  but all of those listed are external factors  i think people often mistype him as Fi dom due to him talking a lot about his feels  yet in the other hand we need to take note that razor is very analytical  even tho is bad at describing things he has an opinion on everything but can t put the right words to say what he wants  he grew up by himself and learned how to take care of himself so he has a fast and practical way of thinking  klee says that he always knows what to do when she got herself into trouble which leads me to type him with TiSe  im not saying Fi doms can t do not think  its just that in my opinion he leads more to Ti as he tries to always find the best and practical way to solve things   also i think a lot of people who plays with the eng dub may see him as an silly wolf boy since he sounds young and a little bubbly  while in asian dubs he sounds more mature and you can see he is intuitive and protective  always wanting to make sure traveler is safe  and i don t know if thats true but i saw someone saying they changed some of his voicelines and i guess that could really twist how his character is seen ,isfp
hm  why  w   i was also considering  w  for him considering how he seems to want peace and harmony  as well as belonging  where does he show a need for support and security   gen  edit  wouldn t  w  make more sense than  w    ,isfp
someone explain why           ,isfp
where are y all getting   for his tritype  i m not seeing any desire for a unique identity at all  i see more   in his actions ,isfp
melancholic choleric      ,isfp
Flashbacks from trauma doesn t mean Si in stack  it s just trauma  Poor baby    I think Fi dom is quite clear  She is driven by her personal sense of integrity and maintains her boundaries and personal needs ,isfp
Isn t that name considered a spoiler   Edit  Nvm it s alright now,isfp
El  Eleven  is an obvious sp     Self Preservation Type Sixes are the most conscious of feeling fearful and insecure  They seek security and protection within friendships and alliances     Also  I would like to add that she has a   wing instead of a   wing because sixes with a   wing tend to be more sociable than most other sixes and I just cannot see that in El ,isfp
lmao i took a test on keys cognition com  usually accurate  but as eleven and it gave me ISFP,isfp
why  w  and not  w    and btw she has no si lol shes not an ISFJ,isfp
I m tired of people saying she s an ISFJ  where s the f cking Si  She s an obvious Fi dom,isfp
She s like    nearly archetypical Fi dom   character Though I had hard time seeing that at first,isfp
ALRIGHT NOW WHO DID THIS NAME  ,isfp
i know an ISFP when i see one   also she s pretty quiet and calm reserved so i perceived her more as  w ,isfp
sx    where do you guys see him as counter phobic  just because he likes sex a lot doesn t mean he s a sx    He doesn t take risks and going against fear and appear   like  He isn t confrontational or brave enough to be sx  ,isfp
Its always me getting attached to ISFP characters lol,isfp
fi where                  ,isfp
yoon bum as a sx   it s such a funny thing lol don t you want to type him as a  w   I mean  if we are already joking,isfp
just because he engaged and liked sex a lot doesn t mean he s sx dom guys   iv subtypes don t work like that  he is sp  ,isfp
Wait  Yoon bum as a  sx  Is it a joke  sx  is the countertype and appears   like  Omg There s no way,isfp
WTF  yoon bum as a  sX      WHY  HOW  WHERE    sp  it is the most fearful  shy  insecure and anxious    sp users seeks protection  His energy generates a feeling of warmth  awakening the desire to welcome him  It is very dependent and sensitive  They tend to suffer from the  Stockholm syndrome   they identify with the aggressor and come to think that they  deserve it      sx  they face fear by taking risks and going against fear  They go forward  It s all about adrenaline  as if in every situation of fear they need to prove themselves that they are NOT a coward  Furthermore  they are the strongest of the    they are not afraid  They thrive on confrontations  as this is how they defend their identity    In conclusion  he is NOT a   sx AT ALL,isfp
could anyone explain why EII ,isfp
EDIT   So I pretty much deleted my previous comment  because I wanted to re start it from the begining  even if some of arguments are still similar  I just delved more into them  Saying this in the case that   persons who upvoted are surprised and don t recognize this comment      Hey there   So  I can see why would people type him as a      since it is the passive tritype  let alone that he priviledged Sangwoo s need all the time over his  but let me offer an other alternative  since I believe he may be  in fact  a        I think that  indeed  if he would have been a      it would have been a whole different story  not a bad one  but I doubt that it would have been like this  Indeed  the story wasn t about Yoon bum  who wanted to save Sangwoo  nor try to help him  that s not why he stayed in his abusive  relationship  at all  I think that  if he would have been a  s  Yoon bum might have had a very  but I can fix him   I can save him   mindset  yet  that s not really what happened  even if it s been a while since I ve read KS  so if anyone remember anything like this  don t hesitate to tell me    Until then  I think that the reason  he even got there in the first place  and started obsessing about Sangwoo  was because he projected the image that Sangwoo would save him   I mean  he saved him in the military  The reason that this  mattered so much to Yoon bum s eyes  is very likely because of everything that happened with this uncle  where no one actually helped him  despite the fact that the grandma literally knew about it  Hereby  when Sangwoo came along  Yoon bum projected this image of a saviour on him  If I remember quite well   s  want to rescue people  while  s  want to be saved  and Yoon bum seems to be the latter  Ironically  his need for Sangwoo  came from his obssession to be saved  which also makes me think that Yoon bum honestly would have obssessed with anyone that would have saved him from there  but I digress  Another thing that I d like to bring to attention  was the fact that at the very beginning  despite the fact that he was absolutely obssessed about Sangwoo  he stayed mainly distant  Of course  it could be because he knew it wouldn t end well  but to be fair  I feel like a   would have been much more clingy  if that makes any sense   Like a particularly clingy stalker who constantly try to be noticed  but Yoon bum doesn t seem to fit this  instead  he stayed fairly distant  just watching everything from afar  I guess people could point out he eventually broke into Sangwoo s home   Anyway  I decided to look it up and  here s this from the enneagram institute    Twos tend to move toward others and engage them  sometimes excessively  Fours tend to withdraw from others  while hoping that others will seek them out  Twos look for people to rescue  Fours look for someone to rescue them    Also  this  from Typology central    Fours are often in search of the perfect lover  someone who will rescue them    Fours are prone to fantasizing about a savior who will rescue them from their unhappiness    which is later completed by the fact that  Fours often idealize qualities they find in others   which might explain the way he completely idoalizes Sangwoo as well and puts him on some kind of pedestal   I m not quite sure whether we should take this quote into account to be fair  since I think that Yoon bum s self harm issues stems from BPD  and I m not sure whether it should be took into account in the enneagram  but if yes then    the Four s abandonment issues are likely to be triggered  resulting in a frantic attempt to re ignite the relationship  This can become a recurring pattern in the life of an unhealthy Four    I guess that he would also fit much more the self destructive  s stereotype due to his self harm  but again  since he has bpd I m not quite sure whether it should be taken into account or not  Same goes for the fact he has derealization        would mean triple doubt  but again  those stems from mental illness  so I m not quite sure whether I should put them or not  in doubt  I thought it d be quite interessing to mention it   Also  I m aware that Yoon bum doesn t particularly try to create himself an identity nor to set himself apart from others  contrarely to  s  but I think it might just be explained by the fact that   would be the last number in his tritype  so not the strongest one  if that makes any sense  I think that  even without a    the   core and   in the tritype would give him that very passive state as well  without needing to have the passive tritype entirely   Anyway  if anyone has any arguments  whether it is for the     or      don t hesitate    DD To be fair  I could still see the      but it doesn t seem as someone really tried to dig into the fact he could be a      some people voted it but no one really explained  so I thought I should do it    ,isfp
he is ISFP bc im ISFP too no ok im joking,isfp
Him and Daenerys should be switched  Y all are so quick to type someone based off stereotypes instead of actual functions  Rest my case ,isfp
HE IS NOT AN NI DOM  HE IS NOT A FE USER      Using Ni  The ISFP HAS Ni as tertiary function  Tertiary function is not always weaker than auxiliary function  As the INFJ can use Ti beside Fe The ISFP can use Ni beside Se  Not everyone can predict future outcome is an INFJ  Every mature person can predict what happens if free folks join to white walkers  it doesnt need that much of Ni      Fi   Ni combination   becoming the best version of himself   He is all about becoming future best version of himself  The ISFP can borrow from his future vision  He always act like a night watch when he was not even a night watch  Basically he was a night watch even before he joined them   Fi   Ni        Fi   Ni combination   ISFP empathy    With this combination the ISFP can relate to anyone even if the ISFP hasn t experienced the same situation  When he saw free folk and recognised them he chose to save them from danger instead of fighting against them  He defended free folk and stood up for them against others and allowed them cross the wall      He is a Fi dom   He never violates his values   He can not say a simple lie in negotiations   He has always been true to himself  He always speaks his mind  He has no diplomatic manner  He literally negotiates with Fi not Fe  Te or Ti  Compare this to Daenerys and Margaery Tyrell  two Fe users      He is not Se inferior but Te inferior  I think this is the most obvious one  Seriously  Jon snow and inferior Se   I have an ISFP friend  Once I asked him would you like to be leader If you know you are better than anybody else  He answered No way  He doesnt like to be a leader or making decision for others he only wants to be himself just like Jon snow in the show who was forced by others to be their king  He has always refused to be the king  Compare this to Daenerys ,isfp
E w  for sure  Not sure about his mbti type   ,isfp
I am quite intrigued by the idea of him being an ISTJ actually  He is deeply loyal to his family and the nights watch and wants to fulfill the traditional expectations of him  He is a practical leader and a skilled and observant fighter  He is strongly influenced by his past and his feelings of duty to those around him and it is only after he experienced his adventures with the wildlings that he becomes fond of them and understands there perspective  developing a more healthy Ne over the course of the story  He sees beyond his duty and responsibility and instead focuses more on the bigger picture and possibilities they have to fight the night king  He has his own personal morals  which often go against what those around him believes and he has foes among the nights watch and the wildlings too  This generally doesn t get in the way of him doing what he believes in  which might make many believe he is a Fi Dom  While I agree that he has Greta Fi  I think it is mainly well developed tertiary Fi  since his Te seems to outweigh his Fi at times  He I a great and commanding leader and can be quite blunt  effective and practical if he needs to  He is quite willing to assert himself if his authority is questioned even to the point of going against his own morals to prove his authority  He also has too strong Si for being an ISFP in my opinion  He is way to much shaped by his past and the tradition and duties of his people  for having Si so low in his stack  That s why I see him as an ISTJ  but I could be wrong  The ISFP arguments also sound very interesting and well thought ,isfp
He is so Fi Ni  He is constantly looking at idealistic visions of the future  like being allied with the wildlings  and seeing himself as achieving great honour by joining the nights watch  without seeing the Si details of what exactly will happen if he achieves these visions  they are less grounded in reality than Si   In every situation  Jon looks at his Fi dom morals and honour and tries to bring everything into accordance with them  An introverted perceiving dominant would instead look at different perspectives first before making a decision   example  refusal to execute Ygritte before looking at all of his options   He is most stubborn and combative when something goes against his values    Se  While Jon does have vague Ni visions of the future  he is also grounded in the present reality when it comes to tackling problems and has a direct attitude  not allowing multiple possibilities alongside each other  example  his realistic and slightly stubborn attitude when Sam wants to rescue Gilly from Craster s Keep   He also occasionally gets caught up in the moment with his Fi and Se  not seeing the long term consequences of his actions  deciding not to kill Ygritte  and violating his vows in the cave     th Te  Jon operates in accordance to an external structure  He is happy to let others lead and take logical control  and he is good at following orders and operating under a hierarchy  only disobeying orders when it goes against his Fi  He is averse to making logical decisions on behalf of others ,isfp
For this typing  I think it makes much more sense to argue against other claims most notably INFJ and ISTJ than defend the ISFP consensus    Firstly  for Jon to be an INFJ  he would have the cognitive stack of Ni Fe Ti Se  I do admit that I see some significant Ni in Jon he knew that letting the Wildlings past the gate was the best decision for the living  He knew that it would be risky to travel south to meet Daenerys as the Starks don t fare well down south  however  he also knew that it would be the only way that the living could acquire enough dragonglass and dragonpower to confront the army of the dead and have a feasible chance at coming out on top  so therefore worth the gambit  He also genuinely looked forward to taking the Black  because he thought it was best option for him  a bastard son with something to prove  although others regarded it as a useless circus for murders and thieves  While I personally don t think this evidence is enough to solidify a Ni dom typing  I can most definitely see why someone people see him as a strong Ni user   What compels me to believe that Jon is not an Ni dom is his clear lack of vision in other moments  such as Ramsay s trap at the Battle of the Bastards  the mutiny at Castle Black which also speaks to his lack of Fe  How could he not sense that Allison s crew hated his guts  and that some sense of confrontation was bound to happen  This could be interpreted as a lack of Ne as well  which again would make more sense for the ISFP argument  as INFJ has Ne as its  th slot and ISFP as its  th blind spot  Also  rip to the INFP argument  Another example of Jon s faulty Ni is his poorly made decision to solo charge the Night King  who had a couple thousand wight meatshield  Sure  he has his Ni moments  mainly in relation to foresight in the Living vs  Dead war   but he also has these reckless Ni child moments where his gut feeling is totally off  leading him to dangerous situations such as that  I m not saying that INFJs are incapable of miscalculation  failure  or faulty visions of the future  just ask Melisandre lol   but for these moments to occur so frequently really questions the Ni dom narrative for Jon  Also  Jon s relative lack of Fe understanding and Ne foresight throughout the series once again questions the INFJ typing  Some die hard INFJ typists could claim bad writing on the director s part for these moments  and while I think thats not necessarily unfair  or inaccurate   I also think that when typing someone  especially someone fictional  you really have to use every single nugget of data that they give you  and believe that there is some rationale  pattern  or sense of consistency behind a character  no matter your personal reservations for certain events or writers  because without that  the whole structure crumbles under skepticism   Now for the ISTJ argument  Most of the rationale behind this typing cites Jon s duty honor routine as a clear sign of Si  effectiveness as a leader execution of Janos Slynt for Te  and personal value system for Fi  For ISTJ  I would like to remind you of the circumstances in which Jon was raised  Jon was brought up by Ned Stark  an ISTJ and perhaps one of the most honorable characters of the whole series  Just using logic  it makes sense that a young boy who idolized his father would naturally accumulate some of his values  and considering that Fi is a value based system that sifts through potential values until it finds ones that internally resonate  it makes sense cognitively as well  We can see this idea actualized through concepts such as  the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword   which  in my perspective  could explain Jon s execution of Janos as not purely Te but actually Fi Te  as Jon was using his personal morals  Fi  to reinforce an assertive  effective decision  Te   As for Si  I think that a dedication to duty honor alone is not enough to claim Jon a Si dom  Many characters in GoT are honor bound  but that does not necessarily mean that they are Si doms  In fact  I see being honor bound in the way that Jon is as a testament to Fi  not Si  Good examples of honor bound Si in GoT are Brienne of Tarth  Barristan Selmy  and Jeor Mormont  What gives these characters a more Si like sense of honor is that they are honorable for the sake of honorability  which means that their main incentive of honor is to uphold tradition and satisfy their own sense of personal duty  Si   Jon  on the other hand  is honorable because he believes it is what is right to do  Fi   Just take a look at this quote    I m not going to swear an oath I can t uphold  When enough people make false promises  words stop meaning anything    Having written these counterclaims  I can say with good reason that I saw much more validity in the INFJ ISTJ claims than I had at first anticipated  and that these typings should be respected  at least in principle  While I believe Jon is ISFP  there is room for him to be seen as otherwise ,isfp
This character started off as a child who wasn t loved by his mother because she wasn t there to give him love  his father was the only person who he could truly put his faith upon  he went to the North because that was the only thing he could do  his first girlfriend called him almost a noob because of how much he didn t know because he was focused on himself and his story  He becomes king only because eeeeveryone else wanted him to  and only because of how good a man he had proven to be  This was particularly hard for him to accept because in his early childhood and yound adult years he had to rely only on himself  He s not at all organized  he is just slow to make decisions because he wants to take all the facts and all the opinions into consideration which are his worst points because his Se and Te tire him  He is deep in his affection and connects to few people and he s not charming  but respected  Fi Se Ni Te,isfp
I think Jon is an ISTJ with developed fi  there is no way he is a Te inferior  for example he executed janos slynt even when he was begging for his life  jon clearly values duty and honor over mercy  his Te was very clear in the night s watch ,isfp
I think ISFPs are quite bold and quick to respond unlike Jon,isfp
He s a  w  imo and not a  w   I agree on the ISFP    and I get the people who mistake hiuttm for an ISTJ because of his sense of duty instilled on him by his surrogate father  Ned Stark  However  he uses his Fi in decision making over Te  He makes decisions based on his values and morals over efficiency and productivity   A  w  would not be so willing to stick to their values even when it creates conflict  We  w s HATE conflict  I think a  w  ISFP would have been merciful to his assassins before he was resurrected  He might have sent them beyond the wall to their doom or something but would not execute them himself  At least I don t think he would have put Olly to death outright  Jon cares more about duty and justice than he does peace and harmony  Being both ISFP and  w  is part of what makes Jon Snow pretty unique  Because of his office at Castle Black  he has to compartmentalize his emotions  He has the right Enneagram for that kind of leadership but not the best MBTI for it ,isfp
it was interesting that despite being so gentle and disliking conflict  he was drawn to the mafia and its imagery,isfp
as I was spelling his name to search for him I spelt it as Michael Jackass,isfp
Wait  when did they make a  Classic  Pop   Contemporary subcategory  I mean  it was long needed  but I was just bamboozled ,isfp
RCUAI is weird for him  mainly because he was clearly unstable emotionally and wasn t very stoic  at least not when it came to his personal life   Many of his controversies came from that facet of his personality  and he often complained about being lonely and having no friends  while struggling with pain killer addiction  saying that his lost childhood affected him  and talking about how much the rumors about him hurt him  He definitely had high neuroticism   Also    unstructured    One of his most well know traits was his workaholism  ambition and perfectionism  He was high on at least four facets of conscientiousness  i e  Competence  Achievement Striving  Self Discipline  and Deliberation  with Order being high ish too  So I really don t think it is reasonable to say he was unstructured in the global     All in all  RLOAI makes much more sense in my opinion  and the overall personality actually fits him like a  glove   i felt the need  sorry  ,isfp
Okay  maybe a weird question but probably with some foundation  would sp blinds be more likely to do dozens of plastic surgeries  to the point of disfiguring their faces even   I m going to search for Donatella Versace s type now ,isfp
I highly doubt Michael Jackson is so sx with an sp blindspot  as I see a plethora of sp  traits in him while I struggle to find any so  ones  First of all he had a HUGE focus on acquiring all the rare  unique  and highly expensive items of the world that he wanted  and he was a huge materialist in general   https   youtu be CXl O ViuBw  The sp  traits are all too obvious  his humanitarian work  the way he constantly pushed himself physically to the absolute limit during tour performances  his relative humility for a man of his unprecedented fame  and  most notably  his creation of the Neverland Ranch as a place to replicate the childhood experience that he always longed for  All textbook countertype   traits  I m not completely set on sx sp yet but it makes the most sense  and he is absolutely not sp blind ,isfp
I always thought he would ve been an ENFP type   but knowing that ISFP can be mistaken to be intuitives really has me thinking LOL,isfp
Book harry being sarcastic doesn t mean he s an     like yeah sure he s a lot more assertive than movie Harry but he never really wants to be in a position of power authority  and resists being in those kinds of positions unless he thinks it s the right thing to do  e  g  he was very uncomfortable with his image as the  chosen one  in book    and never really wanted to compete in the Triwizard Tournament   was very uncomfortable with the attention  especially negative attention  he got for it   He speaks up for what he thinks is right but he doesn t want the associated attention for it  nor does he want to be considered a leader  again  unless it s for something he believes in like with DA   The only other example I can think of is him being a quidditch captain in book   but even then  his leadership skills don t really come naturally    Unrelated but I just realized that both my elementary school comphet crushes  Harry Potter and Zuko  are ISFPs  Huh,isfp
the whole  i don t want anyone to die for me  mentality when they re not technically fight for Him is soooooo fi,isfp
why sp sx      can someone explain  gen,isfp
He puts his Fi and Se to good use throughout the series  Ni is shown when he had that hunch about Draco Malfoy being a Death Eater and neither Hermione nor Ron believed him ,isfp
why is he typed as FVLE  it literally makes no sense especially him being  E,isfp
He looks more attached and worried about how others perceive him ,isfp
Anyone with arguments for FVLE ,isfp
If his Ni was a little better a lot of things could have been avoided  I hope that now in adulthood this function has developed,isfp
Addressing Harry s  w  votes and why I think they re wrong    Ok so there s precisely two  w  comments in this page  one is talking about impulsive actions taken by Harry and other analyzed him according to childhood pattern  To each their own    First of all  childhood patterns is not a very accurate way of typing Enneagram wise  and it s said in most Enneagram books there are that childhood patterns might change depending on the person  it may not be entirely accurate and it s not a reliable source because it depends on the child s mind and why their unconscious self decided to adhere to those coping mechanisms   Ok  so that being said  you can say Harry fits in  s childhood pattern  BUT  it s possible to say he fits in most of childhood patterns and I can prove    s were normally presented with the absence of love from a parental figure   likely a mother  Fits Harry   s normally felt disconnected with both parent figures  feeling absence of love or just overall disconnection or misunderstanding  Fits Harry   s didn t know where their place were  where they belong  Fits Harry   s were normally disconnected to a parent figure  thinking they couldn t get the nurturance they should  Fits Harry   s were normally abused by a parent figure  they then learn that their place in their family is of a nurturing role  normally a patriarcal   strong   role  Arguable  but somewhat fits him   s didn t find any place to exist  they often feel like their opinions weren t listened or that they couldn t manifest themselves at all  Fits Harry   Getting this over with because I won t type him by childhood patterns    Now  getting aggressive or asserting himself doesn t make Harry an    While  s are much more in contact and excessive with their angriness   s aren t free of it too  as every gut triad type  You can see Harry denying anger whenever people point it in him  which is more common between  s and  s  Harry s approach to most of his situations sells him off fairly decently  His passion of laziness is evident  apparent in procrastination  alienation and distractibility  His coping mechanisms are also      of a    whenever he explodes in anger he rather put his conscious self to sleep   playing quidditch  sleeping  goofing with Ron and the twins and so on  Harry is much more focused in the well being of others than his own ever since the first book  he s disconnected with self impressions and internal sensations in most of the time and tries to brush it off because for him it is not that important  also a   trait  Harry s anger is shown as passive aggressive behavior most of the times  either by being unpolite and rude or just acting accordingly  which is much more related to   than to  s  The second is much more concerned with being direct and getting things over with than being shady   s are  no nonsense  people  they have little concern with those matters   I hope that s clear ,isfp
    stem  can show some     in him but not enough to convince that tritype  Being uptight one    stem   is present in him prominent with Fi dominant emotionality despite his terrible socialization and distaste towards others  even himself though some arrogance show in him to cope homself from his insecurities  Rather a depressive and loner who wanted to be free and share his passion to the world  being stuck in the dissastifactory life which led him into moserable life  He had nowhere to go but to work in Krasty Krabs  survival needs   He needed love and appreciation too  any types needed this but mostly  s have mostly this  Overlay   and   also present that he wanted to be recognize his potential    Despite his grouchy peraonality and depressive life  I admire Squidward in personal way ,isfp
I think Squid is more suited to ISFP than ISTJ  because it has a strong artistic Fi function  and a strong Ni function  I can t write much about it  I m not that well versed in mbti  but I think it s the right type ,isfp
he is like the cartoon version of michel from gilmore girls  even the ISTJ mistyping,isfp
imagine a type with just FiTe   Maybe that s him  he s the most uniquest and it shows with how artistic he is xx,isfp
I really want to understand the votes in ISTJ  he doesn t demonstrate Si or Te besides  being grumpy   Could any ISTJ voter explain ,isfp

I KEEP COMMENTING HERE HEJAAHAHAHHA  Well anyway aren t high Si users duty oriented and responsible  Squidward literally hates working  and he s more of the type to do what he desires instead of fulfilling his duties  I m still not best at typology tho so I could be wrong but I just don t see Si dom in him  D,isfp
um  ISFP  where is the Se  how are you seeing it bc it s literally nowhere to be seen  i ve read the books and watched the films and  even though they re my golden pair  she is the most annoying INFP ever  constantly in her own head  daydreaming about Edward   The Fi Dom is obvious of course  Constantly introspective and highly sensitive and emotional but reserved and private about her depth of feeling  which overcome her to insanity at points during the story  But an ISFP is not detached from reality at all  and I see the clear difference between the two types with my two best friends  Are they  mentally  grounded or are they floating in space  I ll get back to this point in a sec  Bella has no Ni   this is shown in the way she has no clear plan for her own future  except being with Edward  which is actually very Ne   she wants to align her future with his  we all know Edward is an INFJ  so it would make sense they re a silver pairing  She constantly worries about the future as well  but ISFPs have no awareness or care to think about future possibilities or others  agendas  Sexually  it s so clear she is an Si user  specifically Si Child   The optimistic Si is shown through hers and Edward s interactions when she s constantly pushing him and eager to have sex  but his inferior Se combined with the old fashioned thing and vampire stuff  irrelevant rn lol  causes him to be pessimistic and reticent  which annoys her after a while  She is receptive sexually  and before you use the argument of the first time they have sex both as vampires  I wanna remind you that she was actually still the receptive one in that situation  He was eager to make love to her without the setback and she was eager to receive the experience   Going back to the detached from reality thing  this is usually the most observable external trait of INFPs  and the Child  aka tertiary  function is  in orbit  so to speak with the trickster function  aka PoLR   Even just watching the movies  the amount of times she trips and stumbles and even is aware herself that she s unaware of her surroundings  a lot in the first film   INxPs all are never fully present  thus making them likely  LIKELY   to be clumsy  not care know how to dress as stylishly  which is Bella   I could also see some people using the manic  adrenaline junkie  thing as an argument for Se  that makes no sense either  ISFPs are responsible with their Se  not reckless with it like an ESxP or ENxJ could be if immature or using it for relief comfort ,isfp
wow i just found out that she actually does have a personality,isfp
Ni  asks Edward a lot of prying questions bc of her suspicion and is good at reading others  Fe  cares a lot abt her relationships  Ti  goes hand in hand with her Ni to use logic and observations to come to conclusions about Edward  Se  cant keep her eyes off Edward lmfao and is cLuMsY   Edit  i havent watched the movie im basing this off of the book,isfp

An explanation of her Se over Ne   As someone who read all books  long ago  I expect you condolences  just kidding  Meyer has a potential  but the relationship between the main couple was just so toxic and messed up  I never noticed any Ne  She never thought about the new possibilities or new ideas how to improve things around her  she never dreamed about anything elusive  The new moon showed her Se  I think if she was Ne user  she wouldn t need to experience an illusion of Edward s presence through the adrenalin  trust me  Ne users are able to do with their own imagination most of the time  I can imagine that most of the INFPs would create their own dream world and keep the memory of Edward  but they wouldn t need live experiences that much  But of course  everyone is different  even INFPs  But all Bella s attempts to escape from her mental situation was very Se s  I think INFPs would most likely to cope in some artistic way or  as I mentioned  they would create their own world of imagination  or many of them would try to find some spiritual way to cope with it  but maybe not all INFPs would agree with me   But Bella tried to cope by gaining more emotional and adrenalin experiences  she didn t even want to think about an option that one day she would get over Edward  Also  as I know many INFPs  including myself   they tend to think not just about the situations but also about hidden meaning of them  but Bella didn t even try to think about the reason why she gets those vissions of Edward  she just explained to herself by the hypothesis that she is crazy or she tries to fulfill her subconscious desires  then she just focused on actions  But I think INFPs would try to figure that out  Also  INFPs usually think about very abstract concepts and elusive thoughts  Bella never does  As I remember  during all the books  she just described situation  her feelings  behavior of others  She is thoughtful  but very practical person   Also  when she became vampire  she didn t suffer as much as others not just because she had a healthy daughter  loving husband  caring family and she didn t loose that much  but she didn t even think about everything she lost  she was just excited about all new amazing ways how to enjoy her vampire powers  She is always worried about her loved ones  she is very loving person  so of course she does  but she doesn t think too much about her own future ,isfp
The older I get  the more I understand Bella  Ironically enough  there s some genius in the simplicity of her character   she s relatable and any girl can fit herself in Bella s shoes  This definitely can be seen as one of the cons  but let s be honest   that s one of the reasons Twilight became pop culture phenomenon   Here s my analysis    ISFP  Fi Se Ni Te  Fi   Undoubtedly  Bella follows her heart and stays true to herself and her desires  She s not concerned with societal norms or things that don t interest her  One of the examples would be her  dropping  highschool clique after meeting Edward   I imagine Fe user trying to make a balance between these two worlds  Throughout the series  she s actively chasing after the vampire world  and more specifically   Edward  Bella s also a kind hearted and sensitive soul  who s quiet and prefers to be alone  She s a strongly emotional person  but not necessarily expressive   Se   It seems to me like some people interpret using Extroverted Sensing as being physically active or skilled  While this can be true  it s not always the case  It s also characterized by  living and engaging with the present moment  gathering information from the concrete world around the one  Contrarian to the stereotype  Se user still can be clumsy  Bella takes in sensory information around her through engaging with the world and interpretes it through the lenses of Fi  To add  she is also reckless and impulsive in her actions  primarily being driven by her emotions and desires  In New Moon  to get out of the Fi Ni loop  she overused Se to the extreme by risking her life  Notice how better she felt after doing it   Ni   One of the things that make Ni differ from Ne is the fact that it s primarily focused on one  specific goal or possibility  Bella s goal was to be with Edward for eternity  sexual    and actively taking steps to reach it  getting married  becoming a vampire   Her intuition is on spot  looking at how fast she realized Edward might be a vampire  Bella doesn t pay much attention to the past  as she s focused on here and now and future  The only time she was stuck in the past was when Edward left her  but she was depressed because her core Enneagram type  sexual   was triggered  lost someone she strongly merged herself with    Te   She has hard time being objective or rational when it conflicts her desires or beliefs  Fi vs Te   It s worth noting that Bella is fictional character  not the the best written  so it s not that easy to type her ,isfp

Why Chol Mel  I don t really see any Mel traits in him  Chol Phleg seems more fitting ,isfp
he s still an ISFP throughout the series as this guy is nothing more than just a really unhealthy Fi Se user who s stuck in an Fi Ni loop,isfp
I think most of his typology is right  but i wanna bring up the temperament real quick  why phleg mel over phleg sanguine  the descriptions of a phleg sanguine sound a lot more like him than a phleg mel  specially these ones my friend sent me   you are a phlegmatic sanguine  you are peace loving  patient  well balanced  easy going  friendly  happy  cooperative  caring  people oriented  diplomatic  trustworthy  fun loving  and humorous  You are very thoughtful of others  with a knack for empathically putting yourself in other peoples shoes  and value peace and harmony at all times  When the Phlegmatic and the Sanguine natural tendencies are combined  it produces an accommodating  people oriented person who is routine  friendly  and tolerant of others  The Phlegmatic Sanguine is naturally motivated to bring harmony to their environment  They easily accept others  They are easy to be with both in the work environment and as a friend  and they have difficulty confronting or pressuring people  They are more friendly after warming up  and can be very talkative at times  Phlegmatic Sanguine is loyal  consistent  and dependable  They are very independent minded and want to operate by themselves and set their own pace   and for phleg mel  The Phlegmatic Melancholy combination is driven by two temperament needs  The primary temperament need is to be accommodating  The secondary need is to do things right  Either need may dominate their behavior depending on the requirements of the situation  When the Phlegmatic and the Melancholy natural tendencies are combined  it produces an accommodating  routine person who is concerned about doing things right  The Phlegmatic Melancholy is a natural helper and is the most consistent of all the Phlegmatic blends  The Phlegmatic Melancholy is a frequently found pattern  The Phlegmatic Melancholy needs to be alone most of the time and to spend time with their family  They are nice  gracious  and cordial people  They rarely show emotion or affection  They are routine  consistent  and loyal  They have a strong desire for independence and will resist change  especially sudden change  The Phlegmatic Melancholy is accepting and tolerant of others  They have a stoic expression  flat affect   kazuha is an open and social person  who gets along with anyone in his environment and is accepting of the present  rather than trying to dominate his surroundings  and being unaccepting of change  he is in tune with them  when i read about phleg sanguine i think more of what kazuha is like  also  it may be a bit stereotypical  but sp  s do tend to be phleg sanguine or phleg dom  if you look at what phleg sanguine is typed as on pdb its almost his exact typology lmao  i know he has a lot of phleg mel votes but i hope it gets considered and changes eventually   ,isfp
Most precious ISFP boi ever to me  I couldn t think there is so intense debate about his type  isn t Se Ni really visible  He s in tune with external environment and enjoy every sensation it brings  combine with tert Ni digging more in his personal feeling through symbolism  I would say his poetic aesthetic is inspired from those   components  such a laid back artistic aura lol ,isfp
just a question  genuinely curious    why are people saying INFJ  he s quite spontaneous  goes with the flow kinda guy  also  in touch with physical reality  i wouldn t say he s very intuitive questioning ,isfp
There wouldn t be as much fuss if people tried to interpret Jung instead of manipulating his descriptions to fit a function stack  EIEI IEIE  he didn t ever mention  Patiently read Jung and Freud  what they established as conscious and unconscious   the concept of introversion and extroversion  and you ll see he is just the archetypal SiFi ISFP    which is why no one is able to properly explain his Se or Fe lol  If you think he is an ISFJ because of Si and it s Jung you re paraphrasing   then you also think he is an ISFP  but in twisted ways ,isfp
if all the ISFJ arguments are for si not fe  and he clearly has fi  couldnt he be INFP ,isfp
Why high Consciousness in Big Five  I just don t see it in him  Consciousness is about competence  order  dutifulness  achievement striving  self discipline and deliberation and I may be wrong but I don t think Kazuha cares much about this stuff   Also I always saw       for his head fix  idk  He always seemed to be more of having fun and enjoying the outer world than withdrawing from it  like  he seems to be way too in touch with the outer world to have a triple withdrawing tritype in my opinion  but I can be completely wrong about that   If anyone has a reason for that typings  RCOAI and      I would appreciate hearing it  I m just in doubt about them  ,isfp
I had read some of his voice lines  stories  as well as ISFJ and ISFP arguments  and I am sorry but ISFP makes much more sense  The ISFJ arguments aren t bad  but people rarely say how he would be Fe Fi  and even when they do  the Fe arguments are mostly bad from what I had seen  and always focus on him mentioning past experiences from Inazuma meaning Si  and I disagree  Most people who were always living in one country  and then were forced go to place that s not like what they are familiar with would compare those two  and it doesn t necessarily mean Si  Literally anyone would do that  it s human nature  Also  Kazuha is easily a Fi dom  constantly judging and thinking based on his Feelings  not group s  INFP is out of question because honestly  where his is Ne  this dude is too aware of his surroundings  Se   and Fi Si loop isn t good argument here  Kazuha is mentally rather well  so he shouldn t be looping  and loop doesn t make your aux function magically disappear  I would also like to add that Fi is a very subjective function  and that s why his Fi Se might appear to be Si user   And bruh ISTJ voters wtf are you on  where is his Te aux,isfp
why did this get taken down Lol it was just a thought   anyway   i find it reaalllyyy hard to believe he isn t Si dominant  although i can see why people vote fi dom  he initially came across as an ISFP  i feel his profile was open to voting a little too early  we didnt know anything about his personality at first  just that he s from inazuma and his friend died lol   but i guess we had no way of knowing at the time   ,isfp
Itadori is more likely an ESFP  React first process later indictive of Se Fi  He eats the first finger without fully processing how his values feelings only that he needs to act in the moment to save his friends   And he has some stupidly dumb plans that only works bc of his enhanced strength which is very Se Te like such as punching through a wall  He saw an opportunity to surprise the demon  Se  and took the most straight forward way    through a wall to get there  Te    He doesn t really think see through things  indicative of inferior Ni  Like when Nobara childes him for not thinking what would happen if he punched the kid or if it turned out not how it happened  Or when he accepts to challenge Sukuna for rights over his body and thinking he can win and then gets his head lopped off  That s a serious Se Ni imbalance   Ymmv tho  I thought for a while he could be an ISFP but the more I watched read the less I saw of dominant inferior Fi Te issues and more glaring Se Ni issues  Credits to  eggisfruit from reddit  ALSO We have noticed that Yuji already knew about his soul n his body when mahito touched him n also he seems to know more about himself n obviously we can see that he knows his own values   He also is confident that he is strong even after the curse womb arc As u can see he was confident that he could beat sukuna in his inner domain  He also decided to help people so that HE won t regret his living and also stated that HE HAS DECIDE HOW TO DIE    MANGA SPOILER  Recently in culling game arc he said that he was good at remembering faces  n also belives he could be of good help to the society  that is up until shibuya arc but even after that he decided to live    Yess he do get s emotional but for an ESFP fi is the second dominate   As for an se he always enjoyed the present instead of worrying about the future and has been careless of what will happen to him in the future after eating sukuna s finger   So He is an ESFP in both cognitive n letter    Way   U can get that if u read the manga n get to know him more detailed   And it also makes sense that he is an ESFP coz he matches every traits of an ESFP,isfp
N o acredito que ele seja introvertido  Sempre me vem   cabe a a parte que ele conversa com o Jupein  n o lembro  em que ele fala com o menino  e acaba fazendo amizade com a m e do Jupein tamb m e at  vai jantar na casa dele  N o faz sentido  o n mero grande de votos me parece um efeito manada,isfp
Kinda ironic how his inf te is sukunas dominant,isfp
Being idealistic doesn t mean that you re an intuitive  and Itadori is the perfect example of this   An INFP ENFP would be worried about the conceptual congruence of his ideals  and Itadori doesn t do this  He is worried about how his ideals affect the real world and how to apply them  That s why Nanami  Si Te  said to him that his ideals are very difficult and exhausting to apply   On the other hand you have Mahito  Ne Ti   who pointed out that Itadori s ideals had incongruences and made him suffer for don t realizing it before  He was so focused in the real world that he just forgot of the conceptual congruence,isfp
Itadori s definitely a socially extroverted guy  its just that he uses WAY more Fi than Se to not be an Fi dominant ,isfp
Itadori is more extroverted person in my opinion  EXXX maybe  Because I don t know why he s an introvert when he s more extroverted than maki for example and she s ESTJ  IDK BUT YUUJI AN INTROVERT PERSON WHAT  HAHAHAHA,isfp

I already posted a while back on her being an EIE  subtype wise she does seem more Ip than a standard EIE so H subtype seems the best fit  Probably does have a creative aspect  definitely don t see HN  will say EIE HC over EIE HD  I do think she has an Si accentuation though  which probably explains SEI votes in part  especially combined with H subtype ,isfp
After a lot more research into enneagram and rewatching the documentary  I realize I was wrong and that she s probably a  w  instead of a  w   I m not one hundred percent sure about this or her instinctual variant but  w  sx sp seems pretty likely for now  Here s some things from the documentary in general I observed that made me come to this conclusion       Billie seems to downplay herself a lot in her interviews and in the documentary  which is kind of anti    I know many   s have low self esteem but her way of looking at herself seems to be more  I don t matter  than  I m more broken than others  which is more   than    For example  in the documentary  there s a clip of her talking to her fans where she says   This is so weird  you guys  I m like nobody  I don t know why you like me   There s also a clip where she s talking to her team about having the music video be the visual during a performance for one of her songs and she says   My favorite thing during a festival show is looking at the crowd and they re not looking at me        I thought her willingness to express dark emotions in her songs made her a four  but then she said this about her talking about dark topics in her music   I never was like   I m going to talk about this   and  I m going to talk about this   I just talked about what I was feeling   A   would be a lot more aware of the image and emotions they were projecting  to a painful extent      She also said this in the documentary  and if I m not wrong this is a really   thing to say   I m a person that wants to make things better for other people and  you know  do the right thing no matter what it s doing to me  or whether it s right at all  The right thing should be what s right for you    This is also such a Fi thing to say  please stop voting her as an ISTP and actually watch some of her interviews       I know a lot of people say she s not passive enough to be a   but is she really that assertive  She did say out of line stuff in a lot of old interviews but that could just be immaturity  I mean  she was a teenager    a strong   wing  and whenever she did it had a kind of  lightness  to it  like you weren t really supposed to take it that seriously  In actual situations  she seems a lot more passive  Like the way she interacted with Q in the documentary  and in interviews lately  she s stopped saying that kind of stuff pretty much entirely    She did behave a lot like a   in her earlier days  When she was around     But I feel like that s not an accurate way to type her since she was probably disintegrated then and her type was probably still in development  But now that she s healthy I don t really see any   behavior in her    I m still not a hundred percent sure she s a  w  since she seems a little too comfortable with her dark emotions feelings to be a   but it does seem more likely than   for now ,isfp
Her entire album is about how she deals with her inferior and how Fi superimposes her functions  billie eilish seems more focused on her thinking rather than her identity  she seeks to differentiate her thinking from the rest through her songs  She is in a fi demon  even so it shows that her songs are always directed to someone in particular and she seeks inspiration in other things  which would make a TI FE,isfp
Anyone using integration and disintegration as a basis for argumentation  The lines being stress  and growth  specific was a mistranslation of Naranjo that has wrongly been perpetuated ,isfp

Seriously speaking tho  I dont see much Fi on her I see Fe inf tho  Unlike what her fanbase is known to be like  her music dojt focis much on the sentimentalism or emotional  I see a lot of casions where she tries to be  edgelord mean  tho  and tbh she is usually very antiphatic  proppositally or not  and all that Gruge style too,isfp
why is he typed as melancholic    i rlly don t see many mel traits in him  he s not analytical or detail oriented  he s not prone to moodiness  not a deep thinker  etc,isfp
Where is the argument for Si  The only thing I could find for it is the moon scene  but it seems like he s just making an unrelated connection  which correlates more to Ni   Let s not forget that Si is not only about reminiscing the past  but also using it as a device to navigate the future present as well  Ali in this case only chose the shape because it reminds him of his hometown  not for the reason that it could potentially help him survive ,isfp
subjective experience is not a good argument  I know  but I will say as a little aside that all the healthy ISFP  s I ve met in my life are very  very similar to Ali  generally relaxed  laidback people who care deeply about those close to them and can be self sacrificing to a fault  now  to move on to a more objective argument  I think Ali shows stronger Fi than Fe  while he is extremely caring towards and considerate of others  both Fi and Fe are capable of being this way  and Ali s altruism stems more from his internal value system and morality  Fi  than from the beliefs  feelings  and attitudes of those around him  Fe   one prominent example that come to mind is his insistence on calling Sang woo  sir  early on  despite them being social equals and Sang woo expressing his displeasure with the term  as Ali values Sang woo s actions and kindness towards him so much that he believes he should address Sang woo in a manner that conveys his appreciation for and value he bestows upon him  additionally  the scene where Ali fights with his boss regarding him not getting paid demonstrates strong Fi  in my opinion  rather than  perhaps  take primary umbrage at the fact he is unable to provide for his wife and child  he seems more upset that he feels as though he is not being treated fairly and receiving what he deserves  this seems to be an apparent showcase of stronger Fi than Fe to me,isfp
The individual prefers to focus on immediate tasks  taking things as they come  rather than try to evaluate the outcome of present trends  Inclination to tell stories or narrate events on a sequential basis  rather than outlining how one event led to another  He perceives time in an undifferentiated manner  the past  present  and future are all perceived as being in or near the present  When talking about the future  especially one s longer term plan   the individual treats it as if it were accessible today and often is not aware of all the developments that must happen first  He generally has a poor sense of how long things will take and what the best amount of time to spend on things is  Therefore it is difficult for him to stay on schedule without extensive  even total  pre planning ,isfp
ok can we not clutter the comments with unnecessary remarks such as  whErE S hIS fI  or  omG hOw iS hE aN ISFP   by doing so  you re only burying the stuff you re looking for    if you re confused and want justifications for the Fi Se Ni Te function stack  literally just sort by top comments and scroll a little  not that hard      i know my comment is contributing to the clutter  but this had to be said ,isfp

why did yall vote him as an ISFP   where are his Fi   Se     and why mel sang  i don t see mel at all,isfp
To me he was a clear ENFP  More muted then some ENFPs in fiction  but clear when seeing his interactions with an INTJ ,isfp
I think xSFJ voters expect ISFP to be angry selfish grrrrr edgy Eren TATAKAE thing which is not even realistic to what ISFP are like  yeah like enneagram and socionics are unimportant   Mind explaining the Ne and Ti because an xSFJ is not only Fe and Si,isfp

Very tame  and less witty compared to the books  but i didn t always like book harry so that might be for the better to some degree  but would have prefered to see more sides of him still  Wish the movies showed more of the classes  and school parts  there we see more of the character realationships  and drama  and don t say that they couldn t fit it in they defiantly could  the movies became shorter and shorter because that they wanted to focus on Voldemort and the good vs evil part of the story mainly  but that was only a small part of the books  leaving thoose other parts out removed alot of character stuff and plotlines  Show us more of what Harry s strengths and weaknesses are ,isfp
He is one of the best examples of ISFPs and he is just a solid chosen one protagonist from most people s childhood that his adventures throughout films and books gave us comfort and belief in a possibility of anything could happen with magic and not believe that what people tell us who are is true ,isfp

Fi and se is seen through most of the movie and her ni is too strong to be inferior  I really don t see any valid arguments for tertiary te  However i think she s an obvious INFP in the book ,isfp
The scene in which Coraline describes the frame is pure SE  I don t believe that INFPs would describe what you re seeing in the frame just the way it is  and yes for what it could be   Speaking of the painting I always have the impression that it has been abandoned or that it has lost its parents  I automatically want to try to imagine what it looks like and what your life should be like    I don t know anything about  I don t know your story,isfp
can someone thoroughly explain sx sp over sp sx  is it because shes sx  orrr ,isfp
I believe many have confused their Ni with a Ne  I m happy with ISFP in this profile  going back to the ESFP would like to ask moments where Coraline used Te   I see more Tertiary Ni in her as for example in the way of looking for the meaning of something but in an applicable way since Se is its auxiliary function  in many moments of fear and conflict she demonstrated more Inferior Te for her way of dealing  acting personally and not knowing how to act anymore  I believe she would be more inconsequential or would be taken by the abstract if her Ni were the inferior function   ,isfp
can someone give me a good argument for Fi dom    I don t see how she wouldn t lead with Se but that s just me,isfp
Te Ni  she can read how people perceive her and use it to adapt to any situation she s in  for example  when she makes her mom buy her gloves or when she s lying to another mom   Se Fi  when her family hides feelings from her she feels lots of pain and might get frustrated if people lie about how they see her,isfp
I think an ESFP would be more impersonal acting and thinking  Se Te   Coraline in every moment of the film is totally personal  Fi Ni   clearly has Fi  Te  Ni and Se but I don t see her as a dominant Se  where is tertiary Te ,isfp
wait can someone tell me why sp   i dont remember,istj
I don t know how much more ISTJ he can get,istj
This should be the ISTJ stereotype tbh,istj
Hey there     leans on expensive car ,istj
i dont really comment on anything but since this one was too obvious i wanted to add one too   Si doms has a consistent approach to everything and do whatever they believe is right  They store data and filter them according to their personal beliefs so they have their own standarts  They seek out familiarity  stability and security  They are traditional people and they tend to act accordingly to an existing standart  I would put some examples here but literally    he is the embodiment of si dom    Extraverted thinkers can set aside how they feel about something to seperate the objective facts from their emotions  Their judging is based on logic and facts  The best example for that is the theory that he killed guizhong due to her becoming corrupted  mentioned in archaic petra and jade cutter lore  also the fact that he genuinely wanted to help traveler but couldn t because of a contract is another  more canon  example ,istj
I love the way his type is so obvious if si was a person it would be john lee,istj
hes ESTP prove me wrong he literally looks so Se dom,istj
he is both wise and well versed in the cultural traditions of Liyue    It is the preserving tendency of the Si dominant ISTJ that fuels this of course  the immense want to archive information as it is and keep it alive    He s quite balanced as an ISTJ as he is not overly adverse to change  seeing how he actually instigated it by stepping down to see whether the people of Liyue could handle themselves without him   he likely used his Ne to consider this possibility   also him not accounting for the fact that he d be mora less is definitely cause his Ne is inferior lol  Si   Fi makes him very melancholic and appreciative of the times that have passed ,istj
this is such an easy typing  he shows no other functions except si te fi and inf ne  all his voice lines are recollections and memories lmfao to the point where he s even considered kind of a grandpa by the fandom there s no ni  just because he s incredibly attractive doesnt make him an INTJ haha,istj
The ISTJ more ISTJish on all fiction   Why INTJ votes  tho ,istj
unswaggiest demon slayer character ever,istj
Nadie ha pensado en que podr a ser ISTP    Soy la  nica rara  Ok   ,istj
 w  makes way more sense to me  This guy is as tranquil as the water he wields  Whether in combat or in a dispute with his comrades  he always has a level head  We never see an outburst of frustration or anger the likes of a typical sp   would have ,istj
Why is he a    he doesn t seem to be concerned with morality just about getting by,istj
Why Melancholic dom  I saw more of phleg mel or mel phleg on him,istj
Giyu is Fe PoLR  The same guy that got upset when he was told that no one likes him  Okayyy   ,istj
I don t see how Ne PoLR just decides to let Tanjiro live because him and his sister seem different  Doesn t that fit Ne suggestive more  Anyone with a good understanding of socionics want to explain   edit  why was I downvoted ,istj
SP   mistyped as   imo    The characteristic  passion  of E   what we find most localized in the emotional center of this type  is  Envy  which is not so literal  and requires some context and clarification    In E   envy is the most characteristic element at the motivational level  Envy involves A PAINFUL COMPARISON BETWEEN SELF AND OTHERS THAT MAY BE FELT AS WORTHLESSNESS  competitive rage or an excessive striving for merit  Envy can be focused on specific people   as  for example  a brother or a sister  or generally  as with envy of the opposite sex  or envy of the privileged or wealthy    TTS by Naranjo   And in his case  his feelings of scarcity manifest as a sense of being inferior  of not being good enough  and he compares himself not only to his childhood friend  but the Hashira as a whole  He isolates himself from the Hashira as a consequence  and this is misconstrued as arrogance by the others  but when we learn what he truly feels  we find a completely different story      Heroic Self Deprecation  Giyu lives with the belief that he is not worthy of being the Water Hashira and standing with the other Hashira after he survives the selection  because of Sabito  Saying that he is underselling his abilities as a Hashira is an understatement  seeing as he is strong enough to trivialize demons as strong as a Lower Rank and even hold his own against Upper   Akaza  Kagaya  Shinobu  and Tanjiro try to get him to dispose of this mindset  with Tanjiro eventually succeeding     Inadequate Inheritor  Giyu believes he is unsuited to be the Water Hashira and that he took the position from a more worthy successor  He later elaborates that Sabito  another pupil trained by Urokodaki at the time  should have been the Water Hashira  while Giyu only survived the selection because of Sabito protecting him  This is combined with his grief at Sabito s sacrifice and the perception that he did not pass the selection on his own merits  This fact haunts Giyu and makes him doubt his worth as a Hashira  rejecting his position as Urokodaki s successor  However  this dissatisfaction is what leads him to recognize Tanjiro as a potential student worthy of Urokodaki s mantle     Perpetual Frowner  Giyu always has a serious or even unemotional expression on his face  Justified since he sees himself as different from the other Hashira and not worthy of this position  He only smiled for a total of four times in the manga       It is revealed later on that Giyu suffers from an inferiority complex which he developed since his participation in the Final Selection  It gets severe to the point where he contemplates abandoning his position as the Water Hashira until Tanjiro helps him realize that instead of acting on his survivor s guilt  he should cherish his life and live on for the people who sacrificed their lives for him      However  not only can we notice his feelings of deficiency and shame  but also the way in which he reacts to them  and the things he values in life  all of which align with this type       The Self Preservation Four is the countertype of the Four subtypes  AND SO IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THIS PERSON AS A FOUR  Although this Four experiences envy like the other Fours  they communicate their envy and suffering to others less than the other two Four subtypes do  Instead of talking about their suffering  these Fours are  long suffering  in the sense of LEARNING TO ENDURE PAIN WITHOUT WINCING  THESE FOURS ARE MORE STOIC AND STRONG IN THE FACE OF THEIR PAIN     As Naranjo explains  the other two Four subtypes are too sensitive to frustration  They either suffer too much or they make you suffer too much  as a compensation for their suffering   The Self Preservation subtype is the countertype Four because they go to the other extreme  DEVELOPING A HIGH CAPACITY TO INTERNALIZE AND BEAR FRUSTRATION  They make a virtue of resistance to frustration     THIS FOUR SUBTYPE RESEMBLES A ONE OR A THREE  Self Preservation Fours  focus on autonomy  self sufficiency  and working hard may make them look like a One  however  this Four feels a wider range of emotions   MORE UPS AND DOWNS   than Ones even if they don t always express their feelings      The anger Giyu expresses in the story isn t perfectionism  he reprimands Tanjiro for being unable to defend Nezuko in a meaningful way  which is what a subtype dedicated to countering deficiency would concern themselves with in the first place  about doing what it takes   Giyu is a a person who truly believes there is something wrong with him and that he simply isn t worthy to be a Hashira  His development doesn t come from him dealing with his resentment or intolerance  it comes from learning to see his own worth and value ,istj
I don t understand people who say that he cannot be LSI   This guy definitely has  D Ti and  D Si that I am completely sure of as it s something that can immediately be seen from his first encounter with Tanjiro in how he carefully understood and analysed his moves  his awareness of his surroundings and the detailed way in which he perceives and understands it is very indicative of high Si    Also  as some people below say that he sacrificed his principle of killing demons indicates Fi valuing also doesn t make that much sense to me as although his Ne is surely  D as can be seen in him being adherent to this principle  he still goes about logically analysing Nezuko s reaction  comparing her attitude to what demons NORMALLY do and how she must be in such a critical condition  must be craving human flesh etc and thus reaches the conclusion from his experiences with both siblings that they really are a special pair   However what makes me rethink SLI is specifically the way in which he refuted Tanjiro s begging in front of him  telling him how  becoming strong was the ONLY way to solve this situation as the weak don t have any choices and rights and strength is what makes you superior and a champion in life    He  in fact  even considered running away in the face of obstacles  turning your back and not fighting back with no matter how much strength you have got as something very RIDICULOUS   He literally criticised Tanjirou so much just because the guy knelt down in front of him and because he didn t charge at him with his axe which was something that he was supposed to do to protect Nezuko   I seriously cannot imagine a person with Ignoring Se talking like that  no matter how much non stereotypical they are  The above line seemed very Se valuing to me personally and should fit with him having Se in Ego block   But I am still not clear and I ll return back with a changed vote into SLI maybe or even a better argument if I become sure of LSI ,istj
  Non English speaker alert    A bit off topic but what instinctual variants are stand for  I know it has connection with enneagram but I want to figure out how it s working  Sp stand for his ennea   and sx for his wing    Did I get it right ,istj
the enneagram   in this man,istj
this guy reminds me of light yagami LOL both are LSI social   with a   wing the only difference is one is healthy and the other one aint ,istj
i always thought kunikida being an ISTJ was a lot more evident than him being ESTJ  the anime and manga both portray his ISTJ characteristics very strongly    slight spoilers   in the anime  from the very first episode itself  we see how much he hates his routine getting disrupted  following his routine has always been more important to him than the efficiency of his routine  the entire hitori ayumu ova portrayed his dominant si and tertiary fi very well  the fact that the bomber guy held a grudge against kunikida because of kunikida s excessive ideals is also pretty strong evidence  we also see him giving a lot of emphasis to his ideals  in the anime  he keeps mentioning how he doesn t want anyone to die in front of his eyes because of his ideals  in the manga  he literally puts his life in danger to save the rest of the ada members because  again  ideals   what could be coming off as him being te dom could actually be a manifestation of his choleric dominant temperament ,istj
This is the core   representation we all needed  Love his character and his struggle was very relatable to me  he s underrated as hell ,istj
I really adore how his Si dom Ne inferior contrasts with Dazai s Ne dom Si inferior  which results in Kunikida getting infuriated with him because of that ,istj
He s like the definition of an enneagram   ,istj
The most Judger and eneagram   character I ve seen  I m reading the  st light novel   Dazai s entrance exam  and he doesn t stop talking abt planing every single second of his day and his ideals lol  and I love how he is a Si dom and Ne inferior while Dazai is a Ne dom with Si inf lmao,istj
Enneagram   core is immediately obvious when reading the light novels  In the first  he constantly talk about living to his morals and ideals  He is concerned with doing things right ,istj
i remember when he was typed as an ESTJ   it was horrifying,istj
When I typing a comment or a post and always tapping the wrong area or accidentally close to submit the comment under near at my keypad  It definitely loses all my favorable remarks and going back to square one  Oh well crap  I will never get to used of this    And also the snow feature always glitching as I scroll back and forth  ,istj
I don t think I ve ever seen a  tag yourself  profile where the consensus is a sensor   wow   ,istj

Why are we forever stuck with our old medieval status now    It s been weeks since I m a  honorable steward  despite having received hundreds of new upvotes   Can t we just maintain the   systems  the peas AND the community standing with the old medieval status  It was quite funny and very useful to detect newbies  cause you wouldn t stay a  fair page  for long if you ve posted good comments  I miss having immediately a vague idea of who you were actually talking to ,istj
THEY COULD VE JUST ADDED THE DARK MODE OPTION AND THE ABILITY TO SEARCH USERS WHY DID THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE THING ITSSO BAD,istj

while they were updating it was hard to get on cuz it kept on saying too many uses online for this small website or something like what,istj
alright not gonna lie  i didn t mind it before and thought it was kind of interesting but now i can t find       and its starting to get         annoying ,istj
Pq ela ta ISTJ  se ela   IGUALZINHA a do filme que claramente   ESTJ  eu li os livros e acho ambas mt fi is  uma das poucas personagens do livro que foi super fiel no filme  pra mim   ESTJ nos   ,istj
I m not      against ISTJ but I do find it annoying that most of these comments are  She is ESTJ in the films  not the books  or  Her Fi is high cuz of spew   They all seem short and repetitive  Anyway  I still think she is an ESTJ  In the first couple of books we can she leads her life with Te  She always makes decisions that will best help her exceed in her academics  to the point of over working as we see in book    She always wants to be right  relying on factual information to prove her point   When it comes to her goals she does what  she knows  will help her accomplish it  which is essentially her Si supporting her Te  She isn t the type of dominant Si user who is always going over the tried and tire method and always seeking comfort in the the familiar  They reflect more b  making decisions  That is why they lead with an introvert function  We aren t even in her head like harry but whenever she is on page she is always either talking about school work or helping the boys with something in the most effective way    Te    Even if she is an LSE  I still think her cognition works like an ESTJ   As for the remaining two  I don t see why I need to explain when the first two are important  Which is why I disagree with some of you guys here  if you are not quite sure what a type is don t decide by what the weaker functions are ,istj
Hermione has ethics that she follows such as no breaking rules etc etc but u can see in certain situations she breaks them too when she deems it fine  In year   she made that potion and she celebrated george and fred creating a havoc in year    While annabeth  an INTJ stuck to her fi at all times  Especially at the sphinx scene  Compared to her  Hermiones fi looks like water  Her wanting rights for elves looks more like ne  She has read a lot of muggle books after all so she knows how slavery looks along with its effects  I think how she tried to get the attention to spew was backed by her fi  which was y it was considered      for so many years  Her fi is all over the place everytime she tries to backup that case  Even when kreacher was being an         to her  she deems it fine  She understands why he behaves like that  clearly showcasing fe  Also her fe was developed too  she calmed the waters in year   when the weasleys and harry heard the order of phoenix convo through an extendable ear  So how can she be an ISTJ with that amount of ne and fe at such a young age   ESTJ makes more sense ,istj
My only doubt is  how is she Fe blind  Yeah she s very nerdy  diligent and all about books and rules initially  strong Si is clear   but she s not so cold and unaware or other people s feelings    Why not ESTJ ,istj
why RLOAN rather than RLOAI  just asking,istj
RLOAN       NON   INQUISITIVE     yall are watching what you are Voting or    psdt  why not rloei ,istj
hermione n o   ESTJ  s  a dos filmes  a dos livros   claramente ISTJ ,istj
any attitudinal psyche arguments ,istj
She s not Fi inf   she literally created an entire campaign fighting for the rights of house elves because of her own personal convictions on the issue  regardless of society at large not agreeing with her ,istj
I agree with her being Si Te Fi Ne in the books and Te Si Ne Fi in the movies  and I think it is pretty well represented by her relative Fi development  In the books  she organizes S P E W  off of her own resolute morals  despite when her opinions of right and wrong differ from everyone around her  Obviously  this whole plot line was cut from the movies ,istj
While everyone is talking about the enneagram  i want to attempt an argument for C   L  i just feel her limbicness is overblown  A list of episodes where twilight shows her  limbic side   taking context into account because not every yell means limbic  so I haven t put episodes where there is a build up to the limbic anger Swarm of the century S  E   Feeling pinkie keen S  E   A bird in the hoof S  E   Lesson zero S  E  Its about time S  E   Keep calm and flutter on S  E   Games ponies play S  E   Princess Twilight Sparkle  Part    S  E  Three s a crowd S  E   Trade Ya  S  E   Twilight s Kingdom  Part   and    S  E       Amending Fences S  E   What about Discord  S  E   No Second Prances S  E  The Saddle Row Review S  E  Celestial Advice S  E  A Flurry of Emotions S  E  Shadow Play  Part   and    S  E        School Daze  Part   and    S  E        Horse Play S  E  Friendship University S  E   The Beggining of The End  part    S  E  Sparkle s Seven S  E  The Point of No Return S  E  Between Dark and Dawn S  E   A Trivial Pursuit S  E     Roughly     out of a total of     episodes twilight appears in     episodes show her being limbic  Look back at the list of episodes  even when she is  limbic  its more of a feeling of dejection or annoyance than a significant shift in mood except for her twilighting moments most of the time  or if the anger is built up to  but those moments are few and far in between and only get farther  Even then  she only gets more calm in the later seasons  She even makes a comment to this development in the episode  the summer sun setback   in general  she seems to be very calm   like when approaching anything  Even if you disagree with me there  lets look at the neuroticism subtraits  another reason I cant see limbic Neuroticism subtraits   anger  anxiety  self consciousness  irritability  emotional instability  and depression  Anger and irritability   she rarely gets angry or annoyed  mostly its contained or she does not let this affect her judgement  Anxiety and emotional instabilty   she is definitely prone to anxiety  but mostly observed in her twilighting episodes  otherwise contained   Self conscious   not worried about how others see her  not worried about how she sees herself  the most self conscious she is is her friends calling her  princess   Depression   definitely prone to depression when she is not able to see a way out   now you can say she is on the line between calm and limbic  but I dont really understand that outside her Ne Grip episodes moments  TL DR I think the difference between C and L is holding in your negative emotions vs displaying it freely At least  this is what i think ,istj
that one rloan vote made my jaw drop tbh,istj
i see a lot of good arguments for  w  but i still believe twilight is a type   sp so     Self Preservation Ones  according to Beatrice Chestnut       This subtype has a need for foresight  a desire to plan everything out  and a compulsion to try to have everything under control  This One also has a faulty sense of security with regard to survival and an implicit anxiety about things not going well and the consequences of failure  This tendency toward feeling anxious and constantly on guard can  in some cases  trigger obsessive compulsive defenses  that is  Self Preservation Ones can become obsessive in their thinking and compulsive or ritualistic in their behaviors as they attempt to reduce anxiety by thinking certain thoughts or engaging in certain behaviors  There are so many things to be done and worried about that this One is rarely able to relax  This subtype is the epitome of a true perfectionist  as they are especially hard on themselves if they don t get things right  They feel compelled to insert themselves if necessary  to make sure every important detail gets scrutinized and perfected    i dont really have to explain anything further  this already describes Twilight so much  and if you look at the   descriptions  the evidence isnt as solid as this one   Twilight focuses a lot on everything being perfect and for everything to go well and that s why she puts a lot of pressure and expectations on herself  she constantly overthinks things and will refuse an option that would have an even SLIGHT chance of it going wrong  she also has a VERY vivid imagination when it comes to things thatll happen to her if she fails  quoting the  implicit anxiety about things not going well and the consequences of failure     i agree twilight has many traits and evidence leading her to become a    but type   including her variants is stronger evidence for me imo    rememeber that your variants greatly affect your enneagram as well  they arent just seperate ,istj
imo shes  w  over  w   her desire is to be knowledgeable  competent and useful  Also head triad fits her more than gut triad tbh  She does have   desires  but she shows more   desires  Btw her tritype is     over      triple competency really makes sense for her  also sp so over so sp   imo  i do see so   traits but sp   fits her more tbh  sp   s often get confused as enneagram   s or enneagram   s   also healthy ISTJ  her te is obvious imo  her logic seems to be very objective and she cares more about efficient information and facts  also i did see a lot of fi tert  Also the si dom is obvious too ,istj
love myself a healthy ISTJ protgonist   can someone explain limbic  most of the time she seems to keep a level head,istj
Twilight is a   with a   fix  not a   with a   fix  She certainly is not a social    Not certain what type of   she is     w   Basic Fear  Five wing sixes fear being useless or incapable  They seek to improve the world around them in order to feel worthy   Basic Desire  Their basic desire is to be competent and useful  They usually show this by picking up new skills and pieces of knowledge that can be of benefit   Troubleshooters may withdraw from others to cope with stressful situations  which can tend to make them feel lonely    w    Basic Fear  People who are type one with a two wing generally have a basic fear of being immoral and making impure choices  They avoid this by making a conscious effort to make ethical choices   Basic Desire  They also have a natural desire to be upstanding and humane  They try to fight for the rights of those less fortunate and love being hands on in making a difference by volunteering in their community   Activists tend to respond to negativity by redirecting their emotions in order to gain a sense of control  In type ones with two wings  this may lead to sudden outbursts or breaking points  as they work through their emotions more externally ,istj
THINK  SHEEPLE  THINK  USE YOUR CRITICAL THINKING  we literally see her fear in the season   premier  she fears being incapable and disappointing her mentor  after she became a princess she was able to let go of this fear  I dont see anyone actually explaining  w    ,istj
why Si and Ne over Ni and Se ,istj
twilight isnt that much trying to be perfect as she tries to study about magic and stuff from books to be smart and helpful in society   w ,istj
Also  I thought it over and why LVEF LEVF  Her  freakouts  seem to always be about her volition and her fear of not doing well or her willpower and not anything like emotions related  imagination  bonds  morals  etc  ,istj
Self preserving six  I m curious  why ,istj
I definitely believe he s a  w   but to play devil s advocate  here s a take on type   for my own enjoyment  dr  spoilers      When looking at the core values  type   wants to be unique  Hajime berates himself in the anime for being  normal  to the point where he agrees to become Izuru Kamakura  It also aligns with the desire to fulfill something missing in a   s life  He believes that by gaining a special talent  he can be fulfilled   Obviously there s more to an enneatype than that  hence why   is not in his tritype  Still  I find it interesting how he aligns with those two elements ,istj
could someone explain the   in his tritype  not that i don t see it at all  i just see him having a   more,istj
i love how everyone agreed that he is an ISTJ you guys just can not be more ISTJ than him,istj
Not saying that i disagre with ISTJ    But what are the arguments for it ,istj
has anyone considered the  so subtype over  sp  i don t really remember the game that much but i think the description also fits him,istj
ok why RCOAN  I see Limbic over Calm   He often showed his anger frustration anxiety and stuff  Also he is VERY overactive and hes very over stressed about stuff  He ususally focuses on the negative side instead of being positive  Makoto is an SCOAI and hes triple positive  tho he was a bit negative sometimes  he mostly focused on the bright side and he was pretty chill and calm  RLOAN makes more sense imo cz tho he was tsundere  i saw A E  He was pretty interested in his teammates and the other members ,istj
I never understood why he s Limbic Calm in his Big    He s often showed anger frustration many times throughout the game  He s quick to overreact too    But they re in a kg of course they re going to be freaking out and emotional  In the prologue before the kg was even announced  he over stressed himself instead of focusing on the positive side that they re at a beach  I can understand why he would be nervous and such  Not to mention he isn t such an optimistic person either  He s quick to see the negative side in situations   And for someone who has Melancholic and Choleric combined  I can t see this man being Calm Limbic ,istj
I think he is LSE FVLE  His logic is extremely insecure in trials  and is rigid  Same with physics  Emotion is generally unbothered  Volition is powerful but flexible  non dominating   As for LSE vs SLI    i believe him to be a delta ST rather than beta ST  and for him imo Ni polr fits more than Fe Polr  He always gets agigated and annoyed at Komaeda s Ni ramblings  not attemtping to understand them and shutting them away quickly ,istj
I m wondering  is Hajime a     or a      Can someone please clarify which one seems more reasonable   I can see him have a   fix  but does he use it more than his   fix  If so  can anyone provide examples    I m just a tad bit confused on why ,istj
idk about the observation functions but her Ti Fe is pretty obvious to me,istj
I think they have fe fi  they seem to have very little interest in their own feelings and thoughts  but fixate on others and try to pick apart other peoples actions and motives ,istj
INTP voters pls explain i have no idea how that makes sense,istj
Fi  expresses self in own way despite what others say Ne  stepping out of comfort zone sometimes Si  frequently remembering mom Te  hardworking,istj
I think Haruhi should have Fe instead of Fi  She s not ever shown to recognize her own emotional needs  but is very quick to recognize them in others  Additionally  I feel like the Ti Fe interactions of ISTP fit Haruhi better than the Si Ne in ISTJ ,istj
ISTP voters  do any of you have an argument for Ni tertiary  At least ISTJ voters can cover every base with their arguments  And why are there so many INTP votes  I haven t read the manga  is it a lot different than the anime  If so  that d make sense   Also why Phlegmatic Melancholic and not Phlegmatic  Dominant    gen  And why  E  She seems pretty assertive with how she feels and her ethics ,istj
idk if she is INTP or ISTJ,istj
I m surprised she doesn t have more ISTP votes  I understand the INTP votes because of the Ti Fe tho ,istj
is it possible that she s an ISTP with developed fe ,istj
Somehow I thought she was typed INFP for the longest time  Shows how much I know MBTI   maybe lol,istj
I was neutral to all  All have their pros and cons  Though i considered ESFP a bit boring ,istj
someone I knew said they were one and I really didn t like them so that put a bad connotation in my mind  I came to the conclusion they were mistyped from   p and I do acc love INFPs ,istj
like they re actually so cool irl like what  pos,istj
I still don t fully  get  the ESTJ even though they re  me backwards   but as I got older I definitely came to appreciate the No BS  No Drama approach to life  By BS Drama  I mean badly used Fe type things like backstabbing  manipulation  and so on   A healthy ESTJ who has all their functions well developed is also funnier than you might think  the Ne is hilarious when it sticks a foot out to trip you when you aren t paying attention  and has a soft Fi underbelly that really cares about you if you re family or a friend and you can count on them to have your back ,istj
i think they are great,istj
The  We are not so different  kind of thing ,istj
Only in real life,istj
Also ISFP ESFP,istj
  ,istj
even though we rarely ever see eye to eye  i ve come to realize they re genuinely very nice people,istj
I love ISTJs the most  Favourite MBTI type  most inspiring ,istj
Are you guys sure of his instinctual variants  I get the impression that he s forceful enough to be sx blind  I m not seeing the phlegmatic temperament either  and I don t know in what world this man would be  V ,istj
kira yoshikage without hand fetish,istj
he s such a d lf yeah yeah    letters required,istj
I love the anti capitalist king,istj
This man literally makes it so easy to type him  istg   He clearly states and describes every strategy and idea he has  In one episode  somewhere around episodes       he thinks to himself how strange it is that Itadori puts emotions BEFORE rationalization when in battle   Of course  not all ISTJ s are like this in real life  he seems to display them as the robotic choleric stereotype  But  he truly follows that strange stereotype well   not slandering ISTJ s at all  I actually find them incredibly fascinating and inspiring ,istj
i love how we all love him  he s just the best honestly  so serious and badass but so tired and completely through with everything and everyone  but also secretly a softy   he s just so great and lovable  i swear there s never been an ISTJ character that i didn t love    ,istj
Imagine being this much of an ISTJ   best character in the anime so far  don t   me ,istj
I love how everyone in this board just agrees that he s an ISTJ  Very calm and not chaotic  except for the occasional subtle thirstposting  just as he would probably like it,istj
i literally have the best conversations with him  Wish he could show his Fi more  Love u dad  ,istj
He always blames us when he loses his keys  at the school meeting of parents he brought newspaper and read it when all the parents listened to the teacher  he left all the material stuff he had at    and went out to sleep on the streets just with with backpack because  He wanted to find his reason for being  and he became a religious positive man that everyone loves  and has adhd,istj
yeah he loves art,istj
Se do meu pai muito doentio,istj
I thought he was ENFP because he s nice and random lol  ,istj
i got him to like taylor swift LMAOO,istj
My dad is goated ,istj
My Dad is a Sociopath ,istj
   year old service technician for a car dealer that still makes fart jokes  loves cooking random things starting new projects  having a few beers and watching the Science channel   yeah  I m not sure what the hell his MBTI is  I m fairly confident in the other types though,istj
we re extremely similar and completely opposites idk how to explain,istj
My dad is an interesting guy  He has a massive vinyl collection but listens exclusively to elementary school assembly music,istj
I don t know how but we re the same person,istj
mines definitely ixtp  but he comes up with the craziest      in the world but at the same time is incredibly detailed with his surroundings so idk if hes ne or se pick a damn struggle,istj
no wonder why we ve always been so similar,istj
My dad is ISTJ  w  sp so     ,istj
he annoying but ok fine,istj
im slightly scared of my dad but I also appreciate the scariness cause he always tries to get me to work instead of being lazy love u dad   ,istj
I love my dad,istj
big brain  dad humour ,istj
my dad is a rare kind  i love him,istj
I can see arguments for ESTJ  but I dont see much Ne at all so going for ISTJ for now  ENTJ is a big no   no where tf is the Ni  ,istj
ive read most of the comments and i think ENTJ in te se loop really makes sense but sometimes our aux function gets more visible than our dominant functions cause the dominant function has always been there so it makes it hard to realize sometimes   but the main reason behind my ISTJ vote is that she struggles with ne more than fi and she is obviously not sp  she is literally the opposite of sp     sx   is kinda similar to   core maybe thats why   core   core debate is still going,istj
I feel like Maki isn t an ISTJ  And I know y all are gonna say  Oh we just can t have any healthy ISTJ s without people thinking they re something else  But I just don t see an present Si in her character  I feel like she s more ESTJ  in many situations of ESTJ s revealing their Fi  they tend to get lost in it  kiyotaka is a great example of this  Mondo s death caused him to become trapped in an Fi loop  When Kaito was presumed dead she entered an Fi loop which basically made her show her emotions a lot more outwardly A LOT more often  This is a very common ESTJ trait,istj
Hmmmm  not really buying the  w  enneagram for her  she doesn t seek security or alliances at all  Also I think her being cautious and secretive doesn t mean she s a    of course an assassin would go to measures to hide their identity from others  especially in a killing game   I think  w  may be plausible  She likes being in positions of dominance with others  especially characters like Kokichi  and also seems to get into a lot of conflict during the game  She s a bit too uninviting and irritable to be a   in my opinion    wing is also way more plausible than a   wing  I think she develops her wing as the game progresses more,istj
Even a pencil has more personality than her   ,istj
lol those   ISFP votes because she is capable of loving someone and has trauma,istj
Maki with aux Ni and inf Fi    Si still IS a sensory function  except it s more subjective and tends to compare past to present  Maki presented strong Si Fi loop a lot of the time  quick to reach her own conclusion based on personal experience and feelings  and it was always apparent in how she dealt with Ouma  Her inf Ne is painful how she never considered any possibilities and wasn t open to anything new or abstract   I would also like to add that loop doesn t magically make your auxiliary function disappear  and if you think she has Ni because she is sus of everyone then guess every person with attachment issues is Ni dominant as well,istj
how is maki harukawa an sp     sp  is the subtype of   that is characterized by acting warm  friendly  and overall harmless in order to win others over and build secure alliances with them  as we know  maki does not do that at all  rather  she does pretty much the opposite  being the kind of character who threatens people with death when they try talking to her  i d say that her intimidating and hostile counterphobic nature fits sx  far better   i m also curious as to why she d have a   fix btw ,istj
Ngl  I think she s an ENTJ  Just a guess  but I ll write more evidence once the thoughts have gathered   I just don t think it s valid to think she s an Si user because of her past experience knowledge  Anyone would have more knowledge of murder the more you re exposed to it  If Maki is an Si user  then Kaede would also be an Si user because of her past experience with piano and making references to it in the  st chapter   If anyone has more evidence to prove her Si usage  please feel free to comment ,istj
Why an   fix  I thought all ISTJs are supposed to have type   somewhere ,istj
Can anyone explain why shes ISTJ and not INTJ  She has an end goal that she works really hard for and isn t so  in the moment  acting  She thinks about the future far more than most of the characters  Can anyone analyze ,istj
so called  free thinkers  when cartoons gfs have reversed function types,istj
So here is my analysis of how the function stack relates to her actions    Dom Si  Very aware of inner herself and physicality as expressed when she understand how she may have been quite mean to Luz   Aux Te  Results in her being very goal oriented as seen with her focus on getting into the emperor s coven  Also she is very bothered by inefficiency shown in when she paces around the owl house with a clipboard and tries to make sure everyone is productive  She also devalues herself when she hears Hunter s interpretation of the tamagochi message leading to how much she values results   Ter Fi  Can be very loyal to her belief of hardwork which leads her to respect luz  Also uses this function when trying to comfort Hunter by relating her own experiences to his current situation   Inf Ne  Can be quite stoic  She also takes her time to fully consider and take in things ,istj
I ll have to see how the rest of the show plays out to decide if she really did change to a  w   I feel like the  w  argument could just be her   fix  Not sure though I d have to rewatch again ,istj
 n o sei ainda opinar sobre seu eneagrama  bom  eu acho que a amity   uma otima ISTJ  na verdade d s do inicio do desenho   possivel ver sua SI TE e sua NE inferior  oque faz muito sentido inclusive  enquanto seus irm os s o NE dom e SI inferior ela   SI dom e NE inferior  e bem  que ela discorda dos seus irm os em tudo   obvio KSKKSKSKSK,istj
I ve seen a lot of people online compare the owl house to little witch academia because of Akko Diana and Luz Amity s dynamic   I do think Akko is Se dom and Luz is Ne dom  and Diana is   core and Amity is   core  but the EXFP ISTJ dynamic is SO cute   I have one conclusion  ISTJ lesbians deserve the world ,istj
Hmmmm come on she is clearly an ISTJ it is sad to know that she and the Light share completely opposite roles but love speaks louder  She has a deductive vision of the future like all IS  she is very logical also she obeys her mother out of fear of breaking a rule and in the end she went there and broke that rule TI ,istj
why Si   Ni  I don t disagree I just want opinions and explanations,istj
lately I ve been seeing people trying to say she s an INFP  how so  how is fi dominant  where s her ne  i haven t seen any actual explanations so can someone at least explain ,istj
can someone explain why sx   so  ,istj
Why this image  ,istj
im so happy I found his mbti without even knowing him  he is dead before my birth           my mum totally approved       ,istj
He died when I was about to turn   but I typed him according to what my family told me  he was such a funny but sad man ,istj
one of the most influential  admirable people I ve had the pleasure of having in my life  he was pretty easygoing and laidback  yet he had an underlying sternness and rigidity to him  he and I would always go hiking  fishing  and bowling together  almost always capped off with a nice meal at a restaurant afterwards  he was immensely kind and humorous in his own way  and he had a real knack for uplifting you and making you feel like you could achieve anything  he was a great father and a wonderful papaw to me,istj
My mom hates him but hes nice with me,istj
The fact that he is ISTP is very strange  since the most common mbti in my family is ISFP  ENFP or ESFP  but he is ISTP  Honestly  I didn t spend much time with my maternal grandfather  the only thing I know is that he is a remarkable Ti Dom  and I realized his other cognitive functions  Se Ni Fe  by how my maternal grandmother describes him  for now I am only clear that he is IXTP  and I think the ISTP description fits him better than the INTP description,istj
He s an old alcoholic farmer who is very hardworking  He has a pretty short temper  He doesn t like a half assed job  He cusses like a sailor  But  he can be super funny  He tells me jokes while we re sitting down by the creek  He makes jokes all the time ,istj
I never even meet him lol  He died when my mom was in her college  Im only typing based on what my mom says about him  and i don t even know how to describe him or telling the reason why i type him as an INFP,istj
A very sweet man  loves singing old songs  drumming his hands on any surface  and we bond over making very corny puns  He s not the most responsible guy and can be a bit of a layabout  but I still love him very much  His late wife  my biological grandma  was an ISTJ  so   golden couple in real life ,istj
rlly cool guy,istj
he went from armless to armed,istj
this one goes out to the fellow lfve voters  genuinely do not understand how this man is vlef please help   confident volition i can see and definitely a high logic  but where is unbothered physics   genuinely asking  ,istj
I don t know why there are so many     votes  he cares for the people he s close to and helps others but none of those are exclusively indicative of a   fix  nothing about him is really        He does not display any outward affection nor need to be loved  neither is he as warm as you get from a   fix  He can be sensitive at times  but for the most part  he presents himself as more cold and imperturbable if anything  He s practical and pragmatic  both of which would point towards a   fix more rather than the more idealistic and positive        also tends to makes one try and help others to grow and they usually have higher expectations not only for themselves but also others  but Aki s criticisms regarding goodness and need to do better are entirely geared towards himself  As a last fix  he s not as image focused or vain as a   core  but he s still very results and achievement oriented  He is initially much more emotionally detached and cold because of how focused he is on his goals  His strong work ethic and desire to execute also exacerbates his harsh self criticism  Pretty clearly   fix to me tbh   He surely isn t triple compliant  double competency makes a lot more sense with how he s always taking it upon himself to logically handle situations  usually acting as the most sensible person in the group  Again  everything aforementioned about how harsh he is on himself and deals with things rationally applies here  He does secretly cry for the sake of others  but that s really only after he attempts to push his emotions away so they don t get in the way beforehand  and he s still quite repressed as he s hardly ever vulnerable in front of others regardless  His emotionality also doesn t manifest in the same way I d expect from someone with a   fix  theirs is usually attached to affection and pleasure   Tritype isn t as dependent on motivations either   you only have one core desire rather than three anyway   it s more behaviour focused  and I think that makes it pretty clear that he doesn t have a   fix ,istj
does anyone have any arguments for LFVE  i m super open to them   AP isn t my strong suit  that being said  i can t see him as  F  he doesn t seem very material and concerned with showing people the  finer aspects of life   while he did share his living space with denji and power  he was doing so because of makima s request  not because he wanted to  i also believe he is  V    V  the reason he is a devil hunter is so he can accomplish his goal of defeating the gun devil and that is why he has been fighting this whole time  a  V would be much more likely to give up on this goal because they tend to be flexible in their goals as opposed to  V ,istj
Are we sure about his tritype  I agree with   x but I can t really see the    Can anyone explain   edit  I m voting     for now   check reply ,istj
I don t understand the  w  votes  He is so obviously morally motivated and worries more about his internal moral code rather than the moral codes or wellbeing of the people around him  Sure  he cares about the people closest to him  but he s more concerned about self preservation rather than helping the people around him  He reminds me so much of Megumi Fushiguro from Jujutsu Kaisen  Both have a strict moral code that they seem to live by  hence the ISTJ  w   His Si is so well developed   he s one of my favorite ISTJs in fiction  Was upset at the way they wrote his ending though ,istj
Still salty about how it turned out for him  His sacrifice was absolutely beautiful  He s the most selfless character in Chainsaw Man  He silently treated people with kindness  he is my fav character along with angel  reze and denji  I realized i always like ISTX characters  Aki Hayakawa  Megumi Fushiguro  Langa  Mikami  Mikasa Ackerman  Uenoyama  Rei  Hakkekkyuu  Akutagawa  Hatori Sohma  Ayato  Nezumi  Genos  Decim  Zhongli  Tadashi  Hijikata  Tomoe  Sasori ,istj
I m still not seeing  w  voters explain their votes beyond saying he saved people and loves his friends so here s why he s not  w   in my opinion  I m basically begging people who disagree to say why  Aki does not put his self worth on wether other people love him  or need him  He doesn t have a desire to feel loved like someone with a   wing does  Aki pushes people away in order to  protect them   Aki is not dependent on the approval of others at all  He s entirely dependent on the approval of himself  and himself alone  Another important difference is in how they work   w s are very involved with others  mostly their community  while  w s prefer to work alone so they can basically plan out their idealistic goals in peace  The second explanation is literally Aki s life hunting down the gun devil  Him being a good person does not mean he has a   wing ,istj
For enneagram  it s obvious he s a    but wing is tricky  Here s my thoughts  Feel free to discuss this with me   I m not sure about his   wing  he does help others  but he doesn t seem to attach his self worth to helping or aiding other people outside of his goal  In fact he seems rather averse to it  Aki seems to turn to routine    staple  in order to avoid his problems  His goal is very altruistic  but I don t think it provides proof of him having a   wing  In fact  I think aki s goal is just more proof of his   core  He clearly blames himself for what happened to his brother  him helping Denji and Power does not show a   wing to me  but rather him not wanting to make the same mistake again  He even says to Angel Devil that if Angel wants to die to do it far away from him  because he s tired of seeing people die in front of him   Could any  w  voters explain the   wing  I just don t see it at all  He s a nice person  but that doesn t make him incapable of being  w  ,istj
I don t see how he could be  w   His beliefs line up way better with how a  w  would act  He isn t one to start philosophising his morals  but would rather act on them instantly like he did with trying to take down makima  He feels a big duty to help others  mostly denji and power  Enneagram   is a perfectionist  whereas one with a   wing would immediately start to work on it and acknowledge their mistakes  Someone with a   wing is way harder on themselves and starts critiquing everything they ve done up to the point of that mistake  which is something aki does a lot  If anyone has any other arguments concerning this I d be glad to hear them,istj
If you think ISTJ are boring   You are shallow and there is no arguement for that   I LOVE ISTJ  I LOVE ISTJ ,istj
YAAAAAY  w  consensus finally  violet is suuuuch an so ,istj
she s really reminds me of mikasa from AOT  and they both have the same VA  best girls ,istj
She is  w  its clearly Why people think this  stuff,istj
anyone think about thesis that she can actually be INFP in grip  anime seems like journey to develop her fi and she somehow looks too fi driven at end to be ISTJ i am not sure tho,istj
Can anyone explain how you place the orders in tritype  Why is     over     ,istj
Why Six over One tho  Because she was loyal  Nah  it s just her Si ,istj
i feel she s so sp   sp so  she has a need for rules an authority and she has a strong moral compass  she s more concerned with helping others than herself and she s extremely reliable  i m not super educated on instinctual variants so correct me if i m wrong but i think the type   so sp description fits better ,istj
She is officially a  w   ,istj
I totally agree that  w  is a more suitable option for her  but I think so sp      sp so  Violet is a pretty clear social   from my point of view  the way she seeks safety is more in function of obeying an authority figure  following guidelines  and adhering to certain values and rules as a substitute for her inner sense of confidence ,istj
I think that in ep   you can really see Violet and Iris  Fi usage but Violet s Fi combined with her Te and Si  She writes the letter to the character who turned Iris down because it was her duty but was not able to view the social nuance of the situation until it was later explained to her  If it were a character like Luculia acting as the letter writer  instead  her strong Fe would have picked up on Iris  discomfort over the party situation   at least  IMO ,istj
ISTP  I am tired because no one will listen because here any kuudere or obedient character is put as ISTJ but here are my arguments  Ti  She uses Ti all the time  everything she does is based on her logic   The arguments I see for Si is  she held to be a soldier and follows it without question  That s what you think Si doms are  Obedient people who just follow orders  watch the anime again  she does what SHE thinks is logical and has independent thinking  doesn t understand collective values and is unintentionally rude to people  Fe inf   Also  It s common for Ti doms to be like  without expression  Se aux  she is direct and lives in the present  objective and practical  she prefers to do things rather than observe and internalize  Si  she is an adventurer after all Ni terc  Episode   shows her Ni terc  she is symbolic whit things she values rather than walking into a range of possibility  Ne  I also don t see Ne inf in Viollet because she was willing from the start to venture out without bothering to go to a different world she s never seen  A Ne inf would be very scared to want to do what she does as a doll Fe inf  The most obvious of all  Her journey is to understand the universal concept of what is  love  a collective value she doesn t understand  she is rude to people without meaning to  she doesn t know how to get close to anyone and  feels  the feelings of others without understanding why  She doesn t have Te and Fi  arguments are terrible here  ,istj
Wtf is with the INFJ votes from some of the comments  Having deep feelings  empathy and wanting to learn basic human decency doesn t equal Fe  Having a strong bond with Gilbert  an INFJ  doesn t mean Violet is an INFJ  Being  mysterious and hard to read  isn t a solely special INFJ trait  Just because you relate to her  doesn t mean she s an INFJ   Stop pulling dumb arguments out of your ass ,istj
At first   w  seemed just fine but then when I came here again and saw some of the  w  arguments I started to doubt   It would be great if  w  voters could explain their opinion  since the comments I ve seen so far mostly talk about  w ,istj
Violet is definitely  w   She afraids of being without support and guidance  If you ve already watched the anime  you can tell from her reaction when Gilbert died  If she was    she wouldn t be so dependent on someone else s orders  she would have made her own way  but she was left without support and guidance  she didn t know what to do  still let me write down   and   basic desires and fears  some of their characteristics       ENNEAGRAM        The committed  security oriented type  Sixes are reliable  hard working  responsible  and trustworthy  Excellent  troubleshooters   they foresee problems and foster cooperation  but can also become defensive  evasive  and anxious running on stress while complaining about it  They can be cautious and indecisive  but also reactive  defiant and rebellious  They typically have problems with self doubt and suspicion  At their Best  internally stable and self reliant  courageously championing themselves and others   Basic Fear  Of being without support and guidance  Basic Desire  To have security and support  Enneagram Six with a Five Wing   The Defender   Enneagram Six with a Seven Wing   The Buddy   Key Motivations  Want to have security  to feel supported by others  to have certitude and reassurance  to test the attitudes of others toward them  to fight against anxiety and insecurity       ENNEAGRAM        Ones are conscientious and ethical  with a strong sense of right and wrong  They are teachers  crusaders  and advocates for change  always striving to improve things  but afraid of making a mistake  Well organized  orderly  and fastidious  they try to maintain high standards  but can slip into being critical and perfectionistic  They typically have problems with resentment and impatience  At their Best  wise  discerning  realistic  and noble  Can be morally heroic   Basic Fear  Of being corrupt evil  defective  Basic Desire  To be good  to have integrity  to be balanced  Enneagram One with a Nine Wing   The Idealist   Enneagram One with a Two Wing   The Advocate   Key Motivations  Want to be right  to strive higher and improve everything  to be consistent with their ideals  to justify themselves  to be beyond criticism so as not to be condemned by anyone  I know she fits   too but I think   is closer  You can read the difference between   and   in the source where I got what I wrote ,istj
imma need this site to stop typing every ISTJ as a core   please    ,istj
She s a pretty clear   core imo    core for her is off  She s always focused on her safety and security and the security of the people she cares for over fearing being evil or corrupt  I don t think she s   fix tho  double positive Violet doesn t make sense to me  She fits triple compliant very well ,istj
why is she phlegmatic dominant ,istj
how is she a     i don t see any   in her whatsoever  i really can t see her core fear being to be corrupt or evil  she reminds me a lot of mikasa  who s an ISTJ  w  with an attachment to another person  who they do everything in their power to follow    You re defenseless when you re eating and sleeping  Your reaction to your enemy slows you down   this line from Violet struck me as something typical of a Si dom    a rule she learned in the military that she never let go of in the present  to defend herself from some nonexistent enemy  Violet also has a very strong value for her duty  a known trait of the social       The name given to this type by Ichazo is  Duty   which doesn t mean they  do their duty   though they often do  as much as it means that they focus on  what their duty is   In coping with anxiety  the Social Six consults the guidelines associated with whatever authority they adhere to  They focus on knowing what the benchmark is and on obeying the rules of the game  Archetypally  the guidelines of whatever system a Social Six follows become a kind of replacement authority for the first authority the parent  usually the father  While they may have rebelled against or been disappointed by their actual father  they look for a good authority in life as a way of finding security  Total submission and obedience to authority  and the rules associated with authority  helps them feel safe in the world    Violet s a textbook so sx  w  imo  i m not sure where the  w  came from at all   sure  she s hardworking  responsible  and dedicated  but i don t even see her having a   fix  i think she has an sx  w  fix instead       i also feel her  w  fix is pretty evident in her character  no need for explanation there  what s with the   fix votes  she has absolutely no   in her  ,istj
ISFJ                                     ,istj
About her eneagram i wouldn t think she fits the standards of    Although she was a soldier who killed several people she wasn t aware this was inmoral thus have been trained to do that since birth  in fact killing all thoose people was the right thing to do at the moment and following so closelly the orders of the general speaks for   behavior  Specially on the episode when she had a breakdown about being worth living after comiting such crimes when she finally realized her  body is burning   I think she always wanted to do the right thing but din t exactly knew what that was ,istj
any ideas about her alignment ,istj
I really don t understand the overwhelming amount of type   votes  she doesn t share the core   desires and fears  Basic Fear  Of being corrupt evil  defective Basic Desire  To be good  to have integrity  to be balanced  she s morally grey throughout the series  and we can tell that being good or moral is far from her priority ,istj
I think her Te aux is not intentional  I mean  she doesn t know what is right and what is not  so  she doesn t calculate her words   And I think is not necessary to explain her Si dom  because is too obvious    GOD  I LOVE HER ,istj
may I ask why  w  instead of  w   ,istj
One of the best ISTJs if I may say so  as far as depicting the cognitive processing and heart ,istj
Such a deep  melancholic  developed  and beautifully written character  Her Te Fi usage made the show for me  and she offered such a unique perspective for a protagonist ,istj
I absolutely loved watching her discover her Fi and truly growing into herself and her emotions  By the end of the series shes an incredibly healthy and fleshed out ISTJ and it s such an amazing journey to see ,istj
Guys please tell me did Violet really have her birthday on July  th because I saw that her birthday is on July    and this is my birthday too https   www animecharactersdatabase com characters php id      ,istj
I had jumped from thought to thought wondering if Violet was INFP because her stoic demeanor reminds me of River  To the Moon   It is my overanalysis  confusing INFP and ISTJ for similarity  I also considered she could be an INTP for thinking is high on her stack  but alas  it didn t click  There is none other than ISTJ as her type because she is VERY dutiful in her ghostwriting work and her communication is blunt with others  leaving a trace of coldness   I think that was already obvious   She has fi for seeking her purpose of the three word affection but isn t in tune with her feelings  Let s not forget she isn t moved by criticisms either  but later reflects on it  Her mannerisms being soldier like is also an inference of ISTJ  not that I m suggesting ISTx are similar mannered   Lower Fi suggests her ineptness towards understanding people s feelings  rather than the lack of social skills to connect with others   Unlike INTP  she is mechanical as a person  rather than robotic  which I think of INTPs  stereotypically  I think of mechanical as precise in their work and their words  which resemble Violet well    Personally  I relate to the personal feelings she experiences within and feels the certain melancholy and fragility in her general expression  yet strong  body and mind    I ve only left at a third of the series  so more may be added ,istj
why ELVF  still learning this new system  i was leaning towards  E because i would think she d have insecure emotion  but i could be wrong about how that works ,istj
She was my comfort character for a while after a close relative died  v  I love her ,istj
Strong Si user  Phlegmatic that stands out ,istj
just because someone is a good person that doesn t mean they re        good   for example  temperance brennan from bones helps solves crimes  on any website she is a hero  protaganist  or  do gooder   yet she is the most lawful neutral character i ve ever seen  although her and violet probably come to a tie   violet is in an environment where she is pretty much told what to do all the time  and because she s a war veteran  and because she is who she is  following orders is her calling  in the spectrum of morality and rules  violet really just does what people tell her to do  right now  she is a lawful neutral  if she were to develop as a character in regards to her alignment  its pretty obvious she would be heading towards a lawful good alignment  but i think this would ruin her uniqueness as a character  violet follows rules because they re rules  not because they re morally good  if you get deep down into her reasoning  then yes  she does has a moral compass like everyone does  nothing is as radical as   if you re neutral you have no morals   because well developed people and fictional characters are more complex than that  a big part of this anime is violet evergarden  a lawful neutral  learning the complexities and good of the world  do you think there would be a plot at all if she was a  neutral good  all the way around  or even in the end  being a lawful neutral doesn t make her a completely thoughtless and or a completely dependant person ,istj
https   hero fandom com wiki Violet Evergarden approved pure good character  so how is she lawful neutral ,istj
She s a sweetheart  I wish I could watch the last movie that came out   ,istj
wait why core    watching the anime she seemed more core  ,istj
Just found out she s    brb boutta go throw myself in a volcano  ,istj
She is very protective like her name,istj
Any reason for   core  I see her more as a   but am open to arguments ,istj
I m in love with her aaaaaa also the anime is so original and well written istg,istj
Hi guys  I m new to this community and I have a question  why not INTJ  I can clearly see why she s ISTJ  she is so well written  but I think it s a little bit hard to me to see the difference yet,istj
Her hair looks amazing      Also she kinda reminds me of saber lol and they re both ISTJs too,istj
shes literally so beautiful holy moly  like god  also the anime is so majestic ,istj
She is such a precious character  The anime drove me to tears  So wonderfully written ,istj
all i have to say is that i am in love with this woman,istj
One of the ISTJs with good character development  I love her,istj
What does phlegmatic mean  I mean where can I find the test ,istj
I hope this will stop people to stereotype the ISTJs as a robot with no generous side ,istj
She reminds me so much of Kanao from Demon Slayer and Aigis from Persona    This story is so beautiful and touching  Her apathetic behavior is just   so heartbreaking to watch  I m so happy she became a much healthier person  and I m grateful for this anime  I feel like it taught me a lot  in a strange way ,istj
Hello  I leave this comment because I wanna analyze one of my favourite characters ever  Violet Evergarden  First of all  we ll start withe her Si  Her Si it s SO DAMN OBVIOUS  since the first   minutes of the anime  she wakes up and attends orders from her major  and that s her Si loyalty  However  Si doesn t come only from loyalty  in fact being a Si user means to be very captive of reality  details  to be very sensorial  As I previously said  Violet woke up expecting orders from her boss  however  this mannerism is shown troughtout all the anime  She has   immagination    fantasy  she is really aware of the conception of reality and the world she lives in  Therefore    Ni  she almost never thinks about the future  In fact  Si does mean that you also rely a lot on past and personal experiences  Then we have Te  the cause which  combinated with her Si  she is disciplinated  organized and careful when she works  Who develops high Te almost always is really captive to finish and do efficiently their tasks  and Violet is one of them   Te Si combo is observable when someone calls her and she reponds with  roger   also the focus she puts on her missions too  And now  her Fi  on the start of the series  she didn t have Fi  She didn t recognize emotions  how to call them  how to properly feel them  She only understands it on the final episode  where she truly starts to understand the importance and meaning of  love   She begins to understand herself and her emotions  her nature  the feelings  nature  as Fi reccomends  She starts to build values on her depeloved Fi  Last  Ne  Literally her inferior function  she isn t that imaginative  she hasn t got the quirkness and perspective of a Ne user  not even afar  In a nutshell  Violet is an unhealthy ISTJ  who later starts to become more self aware  I hope you enjoyed my analysis ,istj
This show really opened my eyes on how unhealthy ISTJ s can be  You can see that she s developing her fi  The story is truly her coming out of her apathy  Beautiful anime  made me cry multiple times ,istj
Why would she be a core    I d argue that her main priority throughout the whole series is her loyalty to Gilbert and following  or deliberately choosing to not follow  orders of those in authority over her  rather than primarily striving for moral perfection and integrity  This lines up much better with core   rather than    I do think she has  w  as a strong tritype fix though  so that influences how she behaves  Also  as for a   heart fix  I think that she uses competency strategies when it comes to heart triad issues rather than rejection strategies in that area ,istj
I don t like when people type almost everybody as INFJ s but hear me out I have a theory  might not be true   I kinda agree that she is an INFJ but I have my doubts  My theory is that I think that Violet might be autistic with the INFJ INTJ loop  kinda reminds me about Shaun from The Good Doctor    The reason why I believe that she might be intuitive is based on the way she tries really hard to analize and process information  Yes  I know that she is always asking others to explain her stuff and replaying that she doesn t understand some subjects  But if is really the case that she is autistic  that might explain why she is unable to understand other s emotions to it s fullest and her trouble with communication  She probably has intuition but she doesn t seem to display it  or well     she does but only when she is in combat  It seems like she kinda doubts herself about her intuitive  calls  and a reason could be because she suffered emotional abuse back in the military way before she meet Gilbert  meaning that she probably was restricted to gave any opinions  give comments to others or own her own thoughts  Think about it  when you are a kid  is completedly normal to ask questions  I mean that s how you learn about life and the world right  Now imagine this autistic little girl in the military that was forbidden to discover herself  to be manipulated and be mistreated to the point to be seen as a weapon rather than a human being ,istj
Like other kuuderes seems to be a ISTJ INTP hybrid   she has traits of an ISTJ but the vibe of a detached INTP that others see as weird  She often behaves like a Ti user but uses no Ti to question anything in her world nor does she show any Ne  Her struggle is with her feelings  she s a feelings inferior archetype  it s clearly her last function as a character  However given how she s presented  no type fits well  No ISTJ would ever act like her  they re extremely sociable  affectionate  comfort loving types that easily integrate into society ,istj
can someone explain to me how her SiTe works  Or your tertiary Fi  I have the impression that the majority voted as ISTJ for the stereotype of  respect the authorities  and  efficiency   The whole journey is about how she came out of apathy to understand other people s feelings  everything she feels is much more outward than inward  She does not feel empathy as a Fi user does  she has never in her life been interested in values or morals as a tertiary Fi  I would say that she is a probable TP  so I would like someone to explain to me without the argument  she is obedient ,istj
Interesting to have an ISTJ admiring an INFJ so highly  from the few episodes I watched  she was completely eneamoured with him and his way of being ,istj
https   www psychologyjunkie com            the nine types of INFJs which one are you   If you read this article  you may find that what INFJs go through inside are much different on how you view them  As what they extrovert is much different from their inner world  I think the important part about typing someone with trauma is typing them after they have overcome their trauma  This show requires you to read between the lines and come up with your own opinions of what the characters are thinking and going through  This  in addition to INFJs being mysterious and hard to read due to being Ni doms  makes it hard for people to see Violet Evergarden as an INFJ ,istj
Literally just her developing Fi,istj
Her whole story is about developing Fi  she suffer from Alexithymia   She listens to the storie of others and relate them to herself and her past experiences ,istj
The seven INFJ votes are ridiculous  Zero Ni ,istj
If you watch back the episodes again and again and again and again  you ll realize that the development is on the Te Fi axis  Her growth is nowhere related to the Fe Ti axis  From a useful tool  to a willful person ,istj
Violet is an ISTJ  w   Her Si is very high  Her sense of duty and discipline are immense  She doesn t have enough Ne nor Ni to be a true Intuitive  I m an ENFP  w  and she basically has many opposite strengths and weaknesses of ENFPs  At first  I wondered if she s an ISFJ  but no  She s not like my ISFJ mother   helping others out of Fe and Ti  She s doing it because of dominant Si  auxilary Te and tertiary Fi   she wants to fulfill her duty  she makes sure the results of the systems are achieved and she wants to understand the process of emotions especially love  Violet reminds me of my older ESTJ sister  Violet has done very well to achieve strong dominant and auxilary functions at such a young age  In the story  she develops her tertiary function which is Fi  Her Fi balances her Si and Te in the end    is about indolence  sloth  action and holy love    is about resentment  anger  serenity and holy perfection  The main point of Violet Evergarden is holy love and holy perfection ,istj
In episodes            and after that that she becomes true ISFJ  She has all type traits   even before  when she had  PTSD  and disorder she always was selfless  altruisic and wanted to protect people who she cared about  Then she becomes kind  compassionate and empathetic  She sees her destiny as helping others and works tirelessly to do it  when someone asks for a letter  she doesn t care about her own need only other person s   ISFJs are industrious caretakers  loyal to traditions and organizations  They are practical  compassionate  and caring  and are motivated to provide for others and protect them from the perils of life   They are conscientious and methodical  and persist until the job is done  ISFJs are driven by their personal values  and are conscientious in their behavior  They typically want to work hard  get along with others  and make sure they do what is expected of them ,istj
for all the INFJ votes  where s the Ni  at the beginning we can all clearly see she likes following orders and has a hard time from switching to being independent  she s straight forward and focused on the real world  she doesn t daydream at all ,istj
Anyone who thinks she s an ISTJ doesn t have the best understanding of how trauma works  Or the cognitive functions for that matter  Even as the blank slate she was  she had a much easier time understanding others emotions than her own  Very obviously Fe  not Fi  ISFJ seems most likely  but I wouldn t discredit INFJ either ,istj
The beginning of season   really makes it look like he s fixated on the past with comparing Dazai to what he used to be along with refusing to let go of all the things he s done to get to where he is  However as we see in later seasons Akutagawa doesn t commit his actions because of his obsession with what he s been through  However someone like Kyouka who is Si dom  has done everything we ve seen because of her refusal to let go of the fact her ability killed her parents therefore she can t be anything more than a killer  at least until she realized the truth   Akutagawa seems to function more from personal morals rather than what seems to be facts  His line of  the weak will die and make way for others  may suggest he has a stronger Te than Fi but he seems to disregard his own judgments by constantly being reckless when it comes to  the hard truth  or Te despite having clear inf Te  We also see him losing his mind when he is questioned which leads to him risking his own life just for the sake of impressing Dazai  This shows he has a very strong sense of Fi Se  MANGA SPOILERS in the fight against fukuchi we see an instance of Ni where he accepts his own fate knowing fukuchis tricks and what he s capable of in order to stop them from killing him  By letting himself get left behind it s both a great sense of Fi and Ni with him making this choice by adhering to both the boundaries he set after the deal he made with Atsushi  and of course knowing well he was gonna suffer consequences if he let himself die  His inf Te might be hard to notice when it clashes with his Fi however you can see it during his arguments with Atsushi about the fact that saving people doesn t automatically give him the right to live  I have yet to find a stronger instance of Te in him and anything that indicates any Si  Yes i know Si doms can act reckless as well or get too much into the moment and get themselves hurt as a result of Fi but that still doesn t make up for the lack of Ne  at least based on what i was able to find  and his Fi Te  I hope the ISTJ voters back peddle on their votes cuz it s very stereotypical at this point  I m not saying Si doms are boring and can t have character development but Akutagawa hasn t done all that he s done just because he s suffered and wants to be the strongest version of himself  that could be an indicator of any introverted function  Let me know if i left out anything or made any mistakes cuz i probably made some with my comparison of Ne and Ni so my bad ,istj
just grow up akutagawa is an ISFP sx  w  vote him ISFP even spam vote it I am so sick of this mistype,istj
I do see a bit of melancholic influence  but why is he melancholic choleric over choleric melancholic  I d say that his result oriented nature dominates his motivations far more than the analytical nature   Also  LVEF  Why  I believe VFEL is more accurate for his motives and character alike   https   www attitudinalpsyche com personality profiles tessera vfel ,istj
I think chol Mel   Mel chol,istj
i totally see him as a sx  w   like sx   his inner motivation is envy  that is represented by his constant need to improve  to show dazai that he s good enough,istj
why  w     w  makes more sense for me,istj
i don t get why he is voted as ISTJ  in my opinion he s ISFP  his te inferior is so obvious,istj
ok  i ve done a huge surf of his page and to be fair i have to ask  where is his Ni  i see more Ne rewatching the show now than i do Ni  let me explain   akutagawa likes conciseness  he creates innovative and well thought out plans quickly  take the s  finale  where he produced the idea of giving the coat to atsushi to merge their abilities  if we compare him to Ni users in the series  take Fyodor  he doesn t plan the way they do  they make long  intricate plans and predict the outcome of things  akutagawa doesn t do that    i have to admit  i m tied between ISTJ ISFP but please can you guys explain Ni  ,istj
please please look up how sp  s can look like   s ,istj
okay but are you serious  sp   armin is a great representation of this but mikasa is completely different of him  none of the typical behaviours or personality patterns from sp  apply to mikasa  if anything  she fits so  wayy more ,istj
She definitely is an IxxJ  As she seems very introverted when it comes to observing her environment or maybe perceiving in general thus i think she has an introverted perceiving function as dominant  If she would be an IxxP I think she as a character by having a dominant introverted judging function would make her much more noticeable if that makes sense but she seems rather withdrawn in general    However I would not say that her Se is inferior because especially when it comes to Eren she seems pretty aware of things that happen in her environmemt thus ISxJ   I would rather say Te Fi because she usually does what she is supposed to do  Te Fe  but if she doesnt  it usually can be connected to her own principles and feelings  for Eren   Fi  rather than critical thinking  Ti ,istj
 Spoilers about Mikasa s development in the final arc      I m back  I noticed that there s a debate about Mikasa being a sx  so I decided to write my own opinion on it   I think Mikasa is not sx   and is in fact a type    Sx s can be defined by many things such as a need to gain a sense of being they don t find inside themselves through fusion with somebody else  They have a sense of uncertainty about their own identity and a lack of structure in their lives  and they look to other people to satisfy their sense of who they are and what they want without realizing this is happening   According to Beatrice Chestnut   The reason Mikasa isn t a sx  could easily be explained by this quote Isayama used to describe the main trio   Some were filled with pride   Mikasa   Some were filled with hope   Armin   Some were filled rage   Eren  But all of them screamed  Pride  Pride in AOT is the ability to live your life with your head help high  to unapologetically live however you want no matter what  It s interepreted as a strong self identity and a strong will to live  Pride was also Historia s arc since she was always living the way others wanted her to live until Ymir called her out  When pride is sx  s biggest weakness  it is Mikasa s biggest strength    When Armin and Eren were struggling and having huge emotional roller coasters that redefined who they were and what they wanted  Mikasa s goals self identity  strong moral code are set in stone  Til the end  she still has that strong sense of what is right wrong and won t hesitate do go against Eren when needed  That s why many people who think that development is only   crybaby with anger issues    badass cold guy also think that Mikasa had no development    Her attachment to Eren and her fear to lose him is not because she finds a sense of  being  in Eren  With or without Eren  she will continue to  be   She proved it in season   when she found out that Eren  died   She s the most resilient character with Levi  What Eren brings to her is security or like Mikasa would describe  a warm home  Her development wasn t about find her own identity apart from Eren  she already has that  but to deal with her anxiety about losing her home  She feared feeling the same insecurity she felt when her parents were gone or when she lost her home during the fall once again  She then started to behave irrationally whenever Eren is in danger during the beginning of story  Sadly for her  her home will always be in danger because of the scenario but also because she relies on supports outside herself for guidance to survive    Mikasa will eventually learn that people she loves including Eren will all die one day and clinging protecting them in order to maintain the little stability that is left will not change that  A support goes beyond a person  structure  ally or belief  It s an internal resource she has a control on and that life cannot take away from her  She can even create her own support since Eren can no longer fullfil that role  which she does in chap        Mikasa shows a good evolution of a type      From  fearing being abandoned and left without supports  which created reckless behavior to the point of injuring Levi s leg  Distrusting of world  always choosing her selfish desires over the world   To  being internally stable and self reliant  Sacrifice her support  warm home  and accepting being left for a bigger cause  Trusting others and create a new bond with them  Creating her own warm home while not forgetting about her previous one   Enneagram   and   are similar so it s understandable that there s this debate going on  However  in my opinion  a better example of a sx  in AOT  unhealthy one tho  would be Ymir Fritz,istj
I can understand why some people mistyped here as ISFJ  The child function is the most function that the person will lean to menifiest with people who trust the most that s why you find Mikasa expresses her love to Eren all time this due to her Fi child that makes her specify a few group of people to care about and express her feelings to them freely but look at others who aren t her friends or people she doesn t know she will appear so formal and cold and focus on the job that she has to do only  I really liked her she is very interesting character who manged to balance between her feelings and her thoughts  In the end of the managa she was the person who offered the greatest sacrifice in the Alliance along with Hange   Her choice was the key to solve the problem and the most difficult descion she took all her life    in the end she prefered others over her feelings so I respect her ,istj
The characterization of Mikasa is primarily someone who abdicates her sense of self  ignores her presence  and takes an indolent approach to her opinions and values   Let s begin with her childhood memories  Chapter    when she was kidnapped and saw her parents get killed  She was in a state of hopelessness like there was nothing she could do   I m cold    Where should I have fled to  Wherever I am will be too cold for me    if you  the mom  and daddy aren t there   She had already given up because she was already separated from her parents  with no one to go to  Herself is only relevant if there s someone to merge with  After what happened she says she s cold and has nowhere to go  Eren gives her the scarf and tells her     It s warm  right        It s warm    C mon  let s go home quick  OUR home   If you compare this to her thoughts on her parents  you ll notice that s not just about physical cold  it s about the lack of something to make her feel okay  to give her motivation in life  After she finishes remembering everything she speaks to herself   In this world  I do have someplace I can return to  Eren    so long as you re around  I CAN DO ANYTHING   That shows how much does she measures herself based on others  on Eren   With Mikasa  it s less about anxiety and fear and more about the need for peace  a stable state of mind  There s no paranoia  obsession with security  questioning of potential dangers    She s amenable and attached to what s connected to her    TYPE NINE REPRESENTS THE ARCHETYPE of the person who seeks to harmonize with the external environment as a way of staying comfortable and peaceful  even though this means a loss of contact with their internal environment  Akin to the meaning behind both  fusion  and  union   this archetype s drive is to maintain a sense of calm and connectedness through merging with the outside and diminished awareness of the inside    Btw it feels really obvious that she fits gut   head  She deals with problems by action and body impulse rather than rationalizing them  just compare her to Jean  Floch  Levi LOL ,istj
can someone explain how is she melancholic dominant   ,istj
I think there are too many type  s in attack on titan  D,istj
melancholic dominant    how ,istj
I m having debate in my head whether she s INTJ or ISTJ,istj
eng dub making him sound like he smokes    packs a day ill get him out of there ,istj
I m not dismissing Xiao being ISTJ cause I m not sure rn but can someone reason his Si  give examples or something  but not him remembering his suffering or yakshas dying bc that s just trauma not introverted sensing lol,istj
New pv he so cute maybe in    we know more him why i think after    he came to meloncholic  dominat  Is this growing feeling character ,istj
Not me finding out that I easily get crushes on XSTX types  cause it s my opposite lol  anyway  Xiao seems more calm and collected in other languages besides English  anyway  he is pretty straight forward  so I m leaning towards ISTJ  I think he rather has a clear Si  mainly  cause due to his past trauma he seems to rather hide his emotions  in the Lantern Rite  I MISSED THE EVENT  E CRY  He seems to enjoy the lanterns in the sky but he says that he doesn t  although  it is pretty possible he s an ISTP too though  still not quite sure,istj
A little confused as to why Xiao s tritype he s        Not saying it s wrong  but is there an argument    I see a sp three fix  possibly  Some pieces from Beatrice Chestnut s evaluation of the self preservation three    Self Preservation Threes express a concern with security in that they have a need to feel autonomous and self sufficient to know how to take care of themselves and others      They seem outwardly calm and organized  like they have it all together  but they are anxious underneath  These are assertive people who specialize in solving problems and getting things done in a high quality way and while they work very hard  they don t show their stress  They are usually financially secure  highly productive  and  in control   but they also report feeling an underlying sense of anxiety related to the effort it takes to achieve the sense of security they crave    He does not mingle in mortal affairs  deems their traditions as repetitive  and withdraws once he s done his duty  as well as to not be a burden  He contributes to Liyue in that he protects the people  as all Yakshas had set out to do   Threes tend to focus on task  on efficiency  on performance  Of course  Threes have feelings  but as much as possible  they put them on the backburner whenever there are things to get done and with many Threes  that is most of the time       has a very personal sense of individuality  fear of having no personal identity and significance   whereas   builds their identity persona on external validation  The personality type Three exemplifies the search for the validation of the self  and so Threes look to esteemed others to determine who they must be  what they must do  in order to feel valuable and worthwhile    Xiao is further fulfilling a pre set role  He is happy to repay his gratitude to the Geo Archon  and he acknowledges a Yaksha s role in Liyue  as they had vanquished demons in the past  He doesn t do this to earn love connection from the mortals  or to somehow cultivate a personal sense of authenticity identity  Oftentimes  fours have a hard time accepting being happy doing something that was preset for them  let alone being solely acknowledged for just that  This is the opposite case for Xiao  he s fine with ONLY being acknowledged for being a Yaksha  as somebody fulfilling their traditional duties    Even in Xiao s voice lines  you can see his over identification with his  legacy    Xiao   Who s there  Oh    You think I sleep  You have no respect for the ways of the adepti    Xiao   If you want no trouble  stay away from me  See me as a weapon  and nothing more    Of course  these can look very similar to a SP four fix  But the distinction on Beatrice Chestnut s website deems Xiao as         Self Preservation Fours can also look like Threes  especially Self Preservation Threes  in that they work hard to achieve a sense of security and may be anxious  however  in contrast to threes  these Fours will often work at cross purposes  unintentionally thwarting their own efforts  whereas Threes tend to achieve what they are working toward   It just goes back to Xiao being rather tunnel minded when it comes to his place in the world ,istj
how do you guys not see the Fe     he literally helps everyone,istj
I can t understand why did you all vote chol mel    he s definitely mel dom or mel chol   ,istj
lmao why VLEF   his F  is the most obvious thing in the world   also yeah i dont see chol mel  hes LITERALLY epitome of melancholic ,istj
 L Xiao scares me  They easily explain what drives them to learn subject matter in depth  weakly resembles him,istj
I dont see Si in him at all  why ISTJ over INTJ ,istj
Guys IVs are a part of the enneagram system  you shouldn t vote SP because she s  introverted  and  emotionless   Rei is one of the biggest SP blind SX  s to ever exist in anime tbh  Most of her existence revolves around the close relationships in her life  Gendou specifically    According to Beatrice Chestnut    Sexual Nines unconsciously express a need to be through another  to gain a sense of  being  they don t find inside themselves through fusion with somebody else  They unconsciously use relationships to feed their sense of being because it can feel too challenging or threatening to be on their own  they substitute another person s agenda for their own because it feels more comfortable to stand or be through another     Sexual Nines defend against the pain of early separation  and separations in general  by unconsciously denying the existence of boundaries  This is an attempt to avoid being aware of their own deeper sense of isolation  aloneness  and individuality  This Nine may have the sense that  I am when with the other   In maintaining the important connection in tehir lives  they may be so focused on meeting the needs of others that they betray their own needs    SP  s are one of the enneagram subtypes who are most grounded in reality  the E  s ego fixation  sloth  manifests itself in the SP   as loss of self through everyday activities and physical comfort  Rei had absolutely   acknowledgement of her physical comfort  instead her loss of self showed in her merging with Gendou and taking on his values  opinions and ambitions  to the extent of completely neglecting her own physical well being  The SX instinct doesn t necessarily mean the individual is intense  emotional  or interested in romance  It represents the need for intensity through one on one relationships  regardless of romantic nature  especially in the SX  ,istj
she s not a self pres   at all lmao her entire identity is based off of gendo   nerv and what they tell her to do or believe in hence the sx  s desire to  merge  and take on the wants and desires of others  I haven t watched eva in a while  but i m fairly sure there s a scene where she states that she s afraid she will lose her identity if others leave her  which is so obviously an sx   mindset ,istj
Self preservation as main iv  Really  She literally admitted that she d k ll herself if comander Ikari told her to  that s the most sp blind move ever  Rei doesn t care about her health  her personal state or even her wellbeing in the whole show  As Asuka said  Rei s a  puppet  BECAUSE she lacks the ability to think for herself once  I propose sx   most likely sx so,istj
Just realised that almost every significant character in this show is on the Te Fi axis ,istj
Literally she is the opposite of sp ,istj
Wait a sec  why   fix over    Is there any reason  Bcs I don t see it   ,istj
I don t agree with her typing but I m glad people are finally realizing that she has personality and feelings and is closer to a  w   Previously the comments were  she s a doll  she has no feelings  and things like  she s sp because she only thinks about herself   This is good    ,istj
Rei is the most sp blind character ever  Self preservation nines prioritize fulfilling their own needs for comfort  Rei is the opposite,istj
why SP   though  i haven t seen the series in forever  but isn t a huge part of her character centered around the way she merges with the wishes of the people around her and entirely lacks desires of her own a sense of self   which is more in line with SX   afaik   SP  s are described as the most  eight ish     which gives them a stronger sense of boundaries  i just don t remember this resembling her much  not trying to argue a point or anything just genuinely curious  this is all considering you can even type a character like her    considering what she is,istj
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY INTP VOTES  IF THIS MAN IS NOT A SI DOM THEN NOBODY IS ,istj
you call this guy an ISTJ  he s always spacing out and is passionate  ISTJs are not like that  also he isn t gay lgbters stop trying to claim him,istj
can someone explain why     over     ,istj
i can understand the Ti votes but can someone please explain where he shows Ne usage  and if not Ne  where does he use Se   INTP AND ISTP votes confuse me in general but i d really love to hear replies talking about his Ne or Se usage so I can understand ur guy s perspective,istj
Why Egocentric over Accommodating ,istj
He s connected to his past experiences through sensorial stimulation and compares how he felt back then and now  thats si fi  His te doesn t really show up at first sign but is present  langa is goal oriented and he implements his learnings in a effective way to complete his own goals and for it he has problems noticing how reki might feel  te fi fe blind ,istj
Why so many votes for INTP  The Si is stamped right on your face ,istj
Langa is a good example of a character who you d easily mistype based on stereotypes  he comes off as an INTP  but actually clearly is another type based on cognitive functions  ISTJ   even though he doesn t fit any of the ISTJ stereotypes ,istj
Ok as an someone who used to think he was INTP I can attempt to explain why INTP voters think he has Ne   Evidently Langa is depicted to have a very creative skating style  He views the terrain around him and thinks of new ways to move forward  I believe INTP voters view this creative style as Ne usage  However it is also valid to think that this creative style is only creative because it is actually adapted from his snow boarding experience hence it can be seen as Si usage as well    Honestly I see both points of view as pretty valid  I see how some people can think he is Fe inf given his awkwardness in expressing himself and him not being able to read the room and being pretty aloof hence justifying the INTP votes  But I think it is also worth considering that Fe is the PoLR of ISTJs as well which makes Fe the hardest function to develop    Still really on the fence but i think this comment is just to try to explain why INTP voters thinks he has Ne ,istj
                                                                             ISTJ    ,istj
People on this site constantly love to forget that just because a character likes control does NOT automatically mean that they re an   ,istj
this guy has so much si  its crazy,istj
      Comments favoring Tobio s supposed   core and it s arguments revolving around his  need for control  and domineering personality completely dismiss the fact that both Type   and   are placed in the gut  anger  triad   Enneagram   is  undoubtedly  the type with the most expansive access to anger and the one who feel most comfortable acting upon it unrestrictedly  Enneagram   s reaction to anger and its natural impulses  on the other hand  often results in over criticism and a self demanding tendency  both instigating a need to correct and control it s environment so it fullfills the   s ideal of perfection   These    tendencies all apply to Kageyama s character  turning him into the archetypal One in distress  an overbearing perfectionistic that  in order to put structure into the outer world  engages in an exceedingly critical behaviour  in an attempt to make others comply and adhere to his demandings   ,istj

Planning to write something  but  clairehu tiger has summed it up better   The reason why he is ISTJ   ESTJ    I would say he s more caught up in experiencing and refining his subjective impressions towards volleyball then focusing the most on the implementation  An example of this combined with inf Ne is when Hinata wanted to improve their attack  but he could not see the meaning in improving something that was already working well even Hinata tapped into his Ni at that moment to forecast those developments  but Kageyama insisted on perfecting what was already there   Compare him to someone like Sokka even  who has tertiary Ne ESTJs are far more  results focused  being Te doms  and would prefer to rely on Ne to help them to get them out of ruts to get results  The end goal is of utmost importance  There is a tendency to get creative in order to generate them  by creating and toying with their Si impressions  I don t see Kageyama tapping into this as much  and despite his terrible social skills  he does not subordinate his Fi to his Te to that extent IMO  The gap between Si and Ne is larger than between Fi and Te just look at how predictable Kageyama can get while playing  but he makes up for that by relying on those very precise Si impressions  going quality over any kind of quantity of maneuvers    Sx  s are intense as hell though  it would make him seem like a Te dom   There are a lot of very good ISTJ arguments  you can look for them starting by looking at the oldest comments ,istj

  Type  s wants to have control over their own lives and do their own thing in their own way  they only fighting outside control with anger and assertiveness so that their impulses for excesses and desires are not restricted     Type  s on the other hand need to have control over their environment  insisting things are done their way with authoritative assertiveness due to their critical and demanding desires of Anger  as opposed to the assertion of independence and freedom   that results from the desires of Lust   Has everyone forgotten that the main passion of Enneagram   is Anger      s is also included in the frustration triad  while  s is included in the rejection triad     Ones are searching for ideal autonomy  That means perfection and complete self control  Ones focus on what s wrong or out of place in a given situation  They become frustrated when they see that things don t live up to their standards and when they feel obligated to improve everything  Their sense of self is based on this frustration   it shows that they still care about making things better     Eights reject their own needs  especially their emotional  vulnerable side   The Eight only has one gift left to prevent further rejection  her strength and will  Eights believe in their power and know that others can turn to them from strength and leadership  Eights expect to be rejected  but because they are so  tough   they give the appearance of being able to handle it ,istj
       Recently  people have been debating the probability of Megumi being a   core  and I m very glad at that as I disagree with the   core consensus  I think that he was just voted as a   because he gives off the ISTJ   stereotype  which is essentially Aki Hayakawa from Chainsaw Man  It s fair as they re very similar characters but I think that it would be beneficial if we really go into depth about the differences between   and    and digest what s most proper for Megumi himself with the information we know  First    core will get debunked  then after I ll go into depth about   is just a general fit  while also contrasting it to        is an enneatype that becomes overly critical of the world through it not perfecting their ideologies and feels a sense of dignity to correcting it  SP   would deal with this by worrying about everything not being perfect and hence obsessively trying to fix things that don t need to be fixed through a way that doesn t let anger show very much  SO   would deal with this by setting a rigid standard for others and expecting them to follow  while a SX   would deal with this by intensely confronting the world and openly criticizing the things they disagree with  None of this necessarily fits Megumi  He pretty much just subconsciously holds back and whenever we see his thoughts in the manga  he doesn t really seem to care too much  If he does  then he just disregards it  I mean  seriously  does the man who says  I m sorry  I don t care if I m right or wrong  I only believe in my conscience  I will follow my conscience and save people  If you disagree with that  then    Let s agree to curse each other  really sound like a    yet alone any of the subtypes   I understand that people might be able to see SP   as sometimes SP   s repress their desires to stop their worries  but SP   s still are very angry at the world and have a strong sense of reform  Some popular examples for comparison are Shinobu Kocho  Ayaka Kamisato  and Yukino Yukinoshita  Moreover  just because he is a serious figure that others look up to certainly doesn t make him a    He might come off as rigid  however it s not in the way that   s are    s can be quite rigid too  which will be covered in the next few paragraphs      is a very misunderstood enneagram in the typology community  People often look at it as a type that only loves restoring peace and that s the main thing that they desire  however that s only a third true  Social   s is the manifestation of   core that do that  whilst SP and SX   do things in their own ways  It s important to note that enneagram isn t solely core fears and desires  there s so much more to the system than that  which I hope the community can see soon  In fact  the system is mainly about how people cope with pain  If   isn t just about peace  then what is it    All gut types           are centered around some type of faculty  a comprehensive and profound tool to harness the behavior the world    deals with by being domineering and constantly seeking intense experiences    deals with this by creating their inner comfort that s stable and can be flexible for their own satisfaction  While   deals with this by again  becoming overly critical of the world over it not perfecting their ideologies and coming after the world to correct it  Just from this alone  I m sure that   becomes pretty fitting for him off the bat   Sure  he does have ideals but having ideals doesn t make you a    pretty much everyone has something that would be perfect for them  What he believes in is not even something that he ever really tries to change about others either  eliminating SP     SX     nor really try to set an example for others  eliminating SO     He simply believes in getting rid of curses and thinks that being a sorcerer is selfish  Does he ever do anything about it  If you need to think about that  I recommend reviewing over his character again      s have a certain degree of psychological inertia  They can come off as thick skinned  unexciting  and have a lack of fire or passion  Megumi lives a very chill life and pretty much just keeps to himself  Others complain that he doesn t really talk about himself often  nor does he really care to  They also tend to over adapt to things so that they can remain inner peace  Throughout the course of the series  Megumi goes with the group for everything and just focuses on fulfilling his duties so that he can just do what he needs to do  get it over with  and go back to his own comfort ,istj
I find this page quite interesting as SLI and core   together doesn t really seem a very probable combo even in fiction as it s quite a contradiction   I agree that his Se doesn t really seem like a valued function at all  unlike Tomioka from KNY who is clearly seen believing in the superiority of strength in society and how you just cannot live in this world without confrontation and determination to achieve your goals  and his Fi also seems as valued to me so I think I agree with SLI very much   Also I think that it s very much possible that he isn t a core   as well  I cannot see him as exhibiting any kind of anxiety that SP  s are usually known to show ,istj
Edit  ngl this comment sucks  Megumi isn t an SP   at ALL SP  s are more self perfectionist and focused on being perfect for others  Megumi doesn t give a single      about other s ideals and focuses solely on what he thinks is right,istj
Please explain why he is melancholic  I don t quite understand ,istj
god his fi is beautiful  and paired with his enneagram  like can you get anymore perfect,istj
Just want to say  loving the ISTJ appreciation we have going on in the comment section,istj
I m pretty new with the Big   but could someone explain why he s RCOEN vs RLOEN  His sense of self worth it pretty bad and he freezes up when his comrades are in danger    i m confused,istj
Megumi  Values socio Fi Some people  Oh yes  he is LSI   Obviously SLI or ILI  I don t understand LSI voters at all  Beta values  Seriously  Also  even Gojo said about Megumi s hesitation to use his power and how he always hold himself   Yeah  Se creative for sure  And about Fi   He said by himself how it s important for him  Megumi listened about Fi from his sister and Yuji  he was obviously affected with it  he rethinks their words and change his views  with Yuji it was when they were fighting in prison   Idk where do you see LSI   ,istj
when he said  I choose who I m gonna save  that screams Fi to me,istj
I ve been thinking  I have asperger s and I m INTP  but well that obviously doesn t matter much  but hey  Sherlon has too much Si Ne  and neither of the two can be inferior since it has too much of both  I have thought and it couldn t be Neither of the two dominant ones since they are opposite since that would indicate that they were in the end  one of the others  I thought you wanted Ne Si    I mean INTP because none would be inferior  or even ESTJ since it would be something similar to intermediate with Si Ne  although its energies are taken from being alone  not from the outside  I trust INTP a lot more  since there is no way that Ne is lower  maybe a very developed Yes  It would not be strange since it is not impossible to develop its tertiary function and less for someone like Sherlon  I will not give arguments about the use of Ne si because it is obvious,istj
Ok  here is what i am getting    He has a tedency to overcontrol like an IxxJ type  i dont know whether it is Ni or Si yet   It seems that he has a Ti preference over Fe  he only answers to his own logical conlusions  he is horrible at reading the  vibe  of the room  considering other people s emotions like Fe usually does I think most of us can agree on that hence the INTP  ISTJ and INTJ votes  which dont make sense because they are all very different from one another  He is jumper in my opinion  either Si Ti or Ni Ti which would make him ISFJ or INFJ which is completely unacceptable how could sheldon be an ISFJ lol  What do you think ,istj
Remove those wrong LII votes  such an obvious SLI  Just read any description ,istj
why is he typed as RCOEI while having such a strong and clear tendency to neuroticism  also  he s totally a   so sp  always seeking to be appreciated and seen as a reference  role model on his field of study for all the competency he acquired  imagine being a  so with a   fix     about the ISTJ vs INTP debate  I used to support him being INTP because he really is INTP in a few episodes moments  but its usual for this type of series to sacrifice the character s personality stability for the sake of laughs    sheldon s personality trademarks are the ones of a  very unhealthy and stereotypical  ISTJ  w   so I might stick more to that vote on the future  if you think he s INTJ I m really sorry but he doesnt display any sign of Ni Se    or at least I ve never noticed that    edit  so many INTP and INTJ voters saying people are voting ISTJ just because of his memory and routine  pls do u even know what Si is   one of the main points of having high Si is knowing and keeping up with what s best for your own health and safety  knowing what experiences were good and bad and placing value on the right things  sheldon has a really good memory but you can notice he changes completely when talking about something he knows it s important to him  almost like he s living it all again  that s high Si my comrades  chef s kiss    BestFunction    WishIHad ,istj
He s a textbook social   ,istj
I could possibly see an argument for INTP  but ISTJ is just simply not true  Everyone likes to type him as ISTJ just because he is a neat freak and a stickler for rules  but honestly I just see this as overblown Ni Se loop and a symptom of possible OCD  in tandem with obvious Asperger s     Ni   It s all over the series  He has this vision of how things should play out and he s always at odds with everyone else because he  has to get his way  because it s the right way and everyone else is wrong  He has no respect for tradition or structures of power except his own theories and bemusements  If you need further proof  the episode where the four guys develop an app together for scanning pictures of scientific theories is a clear cut indicator of Ni  He acts like a baby and insists that his way is right and theirs is  stupid   a common trait of INTJs  and insists they throw out everything and start from the beginning of his vision  They all kick him out eventually because he is annoyingly impossible to work with  a trait of several unhealthy INTJs    It s not just this that signals that  but his entire job is based upon his own musings and theories  pretty much fit for a Ni user  Take for example the episode in Season    featuring Dennis Kim  the adolescent who is disproving his work and on the rise in the theoretical physics community  Because INTJs are so obsessed with the idea of  success  in some way or form  unhealthy ones take their ego far enough to the point where they have to be at the top of the field or else their  talents  are wasted  This is a common trend with Sheldon  In the episode  he eventually decides that if this kid is going to be correcting his work  he will switch fields and collaborate with the other three guys  getting to the top of their fields  This plan fails and the other three become so irritated and annoyed by his arrogance and condescension that they throw him out  This is because he can t get behind ANYTHING that doesn t line up with his vision or how he sees things  and he either decides he has  no respect for the entire field   like he does with the Geology department at his workplace  which is a recurring joke   or he tries to hijack everyone else s experiments to fit his own somewhat formed  if not inexperienced vision  This is what happens and this is why they all tell him to  go away  and kick him out  A common recurring joke of unhealthy Ni doms is they  think they ve got the whole of something or everything figured out   yet they really don t and just get way too ahead of themselves and become arrogant  Sheldon REEKS of this   Te   Always telling people what to do in a condescending tone  mostly in conjunction with his Ni  Very reminiscent of unhealthy INTJ arrogance  very common in fictional INTJs  especially Walter White from Breaking Bad   In addition  goal oriented with a systematic approach to utilization and living  If something does not line up with efficiency  he freaks out   Fi   Very stubborn and childlike Fi that comes out as a result of childhood bullies  being overlooked in life  and a sense of how things  should be   Whenever someone messes with or bullies him  he takes it very personally  like all INTJs do   because anything that is done as an affront to them feels  wrong   Thus they internalize it in a form of black and white morality  If someone wrongs them  they hold a miniature grudge  Take for example the first Wil Wheaton episode  Sheldon mentions that he has a  list of numerous mortal enemies  he has stored up on a floppy disk since he was a child  IIRC  it was in this episode   where Wil Wheaton is placed  amongst a childhood bully and Hollywood director Joel Schumacher  who  destroyed the Batman franchise    for humorous effect  Wil Wheaton sees this absurdity in Sheldon  and like the ENTP he is   pushes his buttons  However  because this Fi is weak and seldomly used in comparison to the first two functions  its downsides are also easiest to resolve  Because  eventually Wil Wheaton  becomes his friend  later on almost instantly due to a quick corrective action on Wil s behalf    Se   Absolutely difficult for him to improvise or adapt in any sort of situational circumstance that does not involve planning or executing a process of his own design  Very symptomatic of an unhealthy INTJ  Always scanning the environment to check if things are in place due to cleanliness OCD  hint  the very second episode of the series where he breaks into Penny s apartment when she is asleep and cleans it up  he cannot even sleep knowing that it is like that  This is an unhealthy loop of Ni Se   He cannot deal with change or even slight spontaneity without some form of a plan or routine to be set in place  However  he will act out impulsively to baser urges when under the influence of stress  alcohol  or drugs  i e  caffeine  ,istj
I think many believe he is a Si Dom  because of his strong memory  even though this isn t related to typology  Typology rather effects the way people remember things and their strategies  but not how well they due in it  Sheldon clearly uses Ne  It isn t his inferior function at all  He has a wide range of interests and loves drawing parallels between different subjects and seeing the patterns  His style of humor also reflect ships Ne and makes him appear a bit random and chaotic at times  His inferior Fe is also clear  He is in constant battle with this function defying social norms  but also having this small urge issued him to fit in ,istj
Si Fi is obvious  he has a concrete personality and wants to reconcile the past in the present and doesn t like change in any form  about enneagram    I think he is a   so sp not sp so you can read the description  he is definition of   so sp ,istj
I think him being on the spectrum makes him superficially seem like an INTP  The high IQ  analytical nature  many random interests can be explained by him being on the spectrum  Also a person s academic personality  the mindset they adopt in their field of study  is different to their actual personality in most cases ,istj
I know that strawmanning is rampant on this site but somehow I m still surprised to see so many  Omg INTP voters vote because he s a nerd  comments when literally no INTP voter has implied to be doing so   The first and most obvious thing about him is that he leads with logic  He needs everything to make perfect logical sense    and he is subjective and exacting and abstract in his logic  He lacks Te  He doesn t look to external data to validate his judgments but instead resorts to questioning to find logical consistency   Secondly  he is hopeless in the real world  He conceptualizes information because that is how he naturally understands things   on an abstract level  He chafes at applied physics and psychology because they don t show the same theoretical promise that theoretical physics does  The fact that he lacks variety and spontaneity in his life is because he s not an Se user   Ne isn t about doing one crazy thing after another because the focus is on abstract potential  not on sensory experience  INPs are not really known for being wild and crazy  Both his Si and Fe are immature  He is rigid and has an awkward  uncomfortable relationship with the sensory world  sensory experience  and is a slave to social norms ,istj
Would you like to explain me why he is a  w  ,istp

Pretty clearly ISTP w  well developed tertiary Ni  One of my easier typings IMO   Dominant Ti  Allegedly thinks of policy and ideas while swimming  seems to be pretty deliberate with how he speaks  some  code speak   which isn t really code speak  as it s easy to figure out if you know much   the actual code speak he uses ire more Ni I think   Auxiliary Se  Likes to show himself doing physical things  was heavily involved in judo  riding horses  etc   but it feels a bit too forced to be Se dom IMO  where it s really natural and just permeates into things   Strong Se pushes him towards enneagram type   IMO in his case   Tertiary Ni  Seems to have a vision  although some in his inner circle say he just suddenly decides things which sounds like Te    somehow I don t think that s really true though   Focuses a lot on a central vision of a multipolar world with Russia being one of the poles  Seems to be very good at observing things in a big picture sense based on intuitions  very hard to detect Ni in public figures though    Inferior Fe  Pretty clear that he doesn t really have much interest in getting along with others really unless he thinks it will benefit Russia as a country ,istp

I don t know why people think he is an INTJ,istp
about  w  vs  w   i would maybe give a  w  vote  talking about the   type in general  w  more independent than  w  and are less likely to rely on others to meet their goal  they are driven forwards even when people doesnt have the same opinion as them  wanting to control their environment and make the possible and impossible changes  his only dream is to  return his country to its former greatness  and he is striving to make it real  they express their ideas more freely and doesnt care about peoples opinions  he is one of the world leaders throughout history who have been very private and reserved  but yet successful with his actions  his fear is to lose control over what he has after working so hard  he has a  friendly  side and he values the thankfulness that he gets from some people in his surrounding which is a part to why he keeps going with his work  he does not like to show his emotions and his mood changes a lot and that is something he values in his actions    I would say that some of these things are common  w   in this case  traits which would lead to  w   w ,istp
just compare her and jade west  who s a very obvious Fi dom  to see that she s NOT a Fi user but clearly a Ti dom,istp
even if there aren t many  i would like to hear the    people who voted INTJ lmaooo,istp
A lot of people here have already clarified why she s an Se user and not an Ne user  but I still see lots of people commenting about Fe vs Fi so that s what my argument will be focused on  Maeve is a pretty obvious Ti dom  She is someone confident in her own judgement and rationale  and heavily relies on reflection and logical dissection to make her next move  But when this doesn t go to plan  her inferior Fe can get the best of her  She takes it out on others  and her usual trust in her own judgement quickly devolves into a refusal to listen to outside advice  when she should   often isolating herself from the feelings of others   Think  when she thought she got rejected by Otis  she refused to speak to him for months  never followed up and generally just cut him out completely  This is Fe grip  It s too much for her to handle  When her Ti is overused  she ends up seeing Fe as her enemy  ultimately resisting social interaction because of its unpredictability  Part of me wants to think this is also why she refuses to get too close to anyone  not just because of her trust issues from trauma  but because she sees Fe as an unpredictable enemy  Her arc with Aimee is a fantastic example of working on building her Fe  although nobody should can ever perfectly use their inferior function   She was hesitant at first with Aimee s advice  in favour of her own rationale  Ti   But once Maeve saw that Aimee s advice actually started working  Se   Maeve got over her Fe grip in some ways and learned through experience  Just my two cents ,istp
maeve is  V    rd  or insecure  volition is characterized by a sense of doubt in own abilities  social standing  the very self   Vs are very sensitive to disrespectful and demeaning remarks  it takes them a lot of effort to build up confidence  they often don t feel like they have the right to have more in life but they really want to  another part of  V is that a person often struggles with making life changing decisions and needs support from other people to both make sense of their wants and can dos and muster enough resolve to do what they eventually decide to do  why did she avoid dating jackson in s   why was she so touched by the public proclamation of his love  why did she run away form the dinner with his parents  because she felt inferior to him  she felt that she is far below his social level  that he has everything and she has nothing  that a guy like him cannot settle for someone with a background like hers  these are all  V fears  why did maeve not want to go to US with the gifted student program  it s a big life decision  and oscillating between options choosing the safer option even if you can certainly do better avoiding making the decision altogether are all behaviors common among  Vs  maeve has decided to go after all only because aimee encouraged and provided support for her in time  essentially why  V is best paired with  V  there are far more examples of this  maeve is good at hiding her anxieties and insecurities but they absolutely are there  and they become readily apparent when examining her behavior and motivations,istp
She is core   but  w  fits her at some point too  I don t understand the   on her tritype ,istp
She is definitely not an Fi dom  The way she decided to choose Isaac over Otis just because it was more rational to opt for a person with whom you ve smoothly bonded over time instead of looking deep into what your real feelings are seems Ti dom with inf Fe to me  An Fi user will have their priorities straight and clarity in emotions  Had she been that  she wouldn t have been so confused about how she feels about Otis   especially in season   and    She doesn t realize until there s some stimulation   for eg   Otis giving the moon and stars speech  him starting to date Ola  etc  ,istp
i think when they were left behind at the france trip it got very obvious that she doesn t have   in her tritype  i mean look at otis an obvious    maeve is not a   just bc she likes to read but she def has   in her tritype rather than   and she appreciates knowledge  isolates herself from people just bc she feels like it  tries to look cold from outside and i don t think she is anxious  loyal etc  she doesn t think of bad possibilities that much  ofc ppl who don t have     in their tritype can have those traits and those are not  s  s only traits but at least it explains why she has   in her tritype rather than  ,istp

Do     voters have any reason for     on her tritype  Her whole thing about being unapologetically yourself seems very   ish to me  I don t she s more concerned with security than with individuality,istp
She s definitely an ISTP  w  her ability to choose her battles like that time she stopped eren from attacking reiner and bertholdt and she assessed the situation analyzing the titans from below and eren still healing    She used her Ti and Fe when she helped Reimer and bertholdt when the titans were attacking them she used her inferior Fe to help out historia and them instead of choosing what she wanted and going with historia and her Ti when she chose personal logical means instead of personal wants  Her  w  shows constantly when she keeps telling Historia to live for herself and how protective and sacrificial she is for her and her comrades     Her Childhood made her into an ISTP and  w  the people that worshipped her betrayed yet she still protected them which made her have an inferior fe and after she turned into a titan shifter  The thing she loved and she was freedom and she did everything she could with it and looked out for her interest for the longest time till she died ,istp
i see se ti  and her fe seems too strong to be inferior  i agree with enneagram    but why wing     also  she s my fav character         ,istp
question abt her big    why N   I  ,istp
Not sure why she s voted      the   fix seems a lot stronger tbh,istp
Why Ti Fi  I honestly think she uses Fi quite a lot  for example even the reason she wanted to meet Historia  She said that she sees herself on Historia and wants Historia to live for HERSELF not for OTHERS  even tho Ymir was like that before too which is why i get the Fe    So she wanted that Historia don t make the same mistakes as her and can relate to her which is in my opinion Fi  Also when she left with Reiner and Bertholdt it can be explained by Fi  Ymir felt that she owns them so it was  the right thing to do  to leave with them  also Historia wanted her to stay  if i remember right   so both of the choises could ve been explained by Fi AND Fe  Okay I m not still      sure about her being an Xsfp so like give me examples of her Ti Fe thanks  ,istp
She is a living ISTP stereotype,istp
i would like to explain why ymir is VLEF to me  english is not my first language feel free to correct   V   ymir highly trusts and values her own sense of character and dignity  ever since she regained her human form ymir put a lot of attention on what she desires and the responsibilities that come along with that  she funnels all of her energy into building her own goals and expressing her willpower   there was one thing i wished for with all my heart  if i m ever given a second chance in life  i want to live for only myself  that is my sincere wish    living this way is my way of getting revenge  i m going to be living proof that your fate isn t decided at birth    from there  i began to walk and i lived the way i wanted  i have no regrets    also ymir prefers to quickly understand what needs to be done in any situation  it became quite obvious when the castle came under attack by titans capable of moving at nigh and she resolved to use her titan to save comrades  i would even say that she always reacts and acts quickly   ymir tends to trust her own knowledge of human endeavors over others and be aggressive about her opinions on obligations  goals  willpower and how to overcome obstacles  she was extremely perceptive and could discern the nature of the people around her with alarming accuracy such as historia s martyrdom mentality  reiner s split personality disorder and sasha s desire to look good in front of her peers by hiding her native accent and developing an extremely formal way of speaking  due to her experiences and belief in self pride  she tended to rudely criticize people for being untrue to themselves  especially sasha in the beginning     L   ymir is open to others  confusion and is quick to help unsure attitudes regarding logic  she highly trust her own abilities to investigate reasons behind any action  she express honest opinions irregardless of how aggressive they are    that s really starting to get on my nerves  that stupidly polite way you talk  why do you keep it up even around us trainees  wait    let me guess  you must be ashamed of the way people in your village talk  right  you know  you re pretty sensitive    for a dumbass  so  all you know how to do in hunt  and you re afraid of society  am i right  probably don t have much of a reason to become a soldier  either  sasha  are you gonna spend rest of your life playing a character because you re worried about what others think of you  that is so pathetic  talk to me in your words     E   ymir has an innate humorous gift  she is inclined to brand a sharp joke and irony about all sorts of phenomena of life  especially those that are distinguished by pretentiousness  she does this with an absolutely imperturbable look  she feels people  their inner world and is able to always remain herself  ymir easily notices the mood and current statement of other people but does not know how to react accordingly  for example  when connie was talking about his village in chapter     ymir changed the subject on purpose so that he doesn t get too worried about his family    hahaha  so    your mom was a titan  connie  if that s the case    then why the hell are you so tiny   c mon  connie  how does that even make any sense  i always knew you were a moron  but    maybe it s the opposite  maybe you re some kind of genius  right  hahaha  so if your theory is right  then your dad must be a titan  too  right   cause if not  then  you know    how would they be able to do it     F   ymir is unattached to the physical world around her  she used to have very hard time paying attention to own comfort levels  this has been especially noticeable since she was a child and lived together with group dedicated to the worship of ymir fritz   in adulthood she also seems to have an easy time adapting to different physical and practical needs  she does not usually care about the value of objects and possessions and has an ignorant and carefree attitude towards all concepts of the physical world  since ymir regained her consciousness and human form  she has traveled to the walls and somehow got access into wall sheena and then spent the next two years living within  sneaking about and spying on their society  surviving as a skilled thief ,istp
someone please put matching icons for ymir and historia,istp
the traveler is so old their functions will be developed   like i said in an old comment   their voice lines  true personality  separate from little choices throughout  have a LOT of Ti   there is no Fi to be found in the traveller  although there is an argument to be made for Fi in the abyss twin  their Ti outshadows their Fe by a lot   and since they re so old   their Ni will be developed as well   and even their inferior Fe   they ve had time to develop their Ni and Fe   and it shows  although Ti outshadows it    additionally  the playable traveler is the same exact person no matter Who you pick   honest to god   subtle differences such as hangout art or really subtle variations in voice lines are Not Enough to argue for Traveller Aether   Traveller Lumine separate profiles   stop it  ,istp
lumine ISTP do not question me i will die on this hill,istp
once this game gets more information about both of them  backstory  how did their past travels go in the worlds they visited  voice lines  etc    and their contrasts we might be able to differentiate them even more   pretty much at this time typing them separately is impossible  we can only rely on small differences on how they react  how they look in the hangout art  different responses in their voice lines   these teeny details we notice  for now can only type them as one cause  like i said we don t know much about them yet  but I agree on separating their profiles so as of now i won t vote yet though their ni in the past event was evident so that s something edit  also since it s confirmed that they were alive during the archon war  their functions should be all developed,istp
what the hell is going on on this page INFJ and ISTP voters are at each other s throats and then all the random ISFP votes help       why tf are yall trying to type them differently they re both the exact same,istp
I m not entirely sure about the Traveler being ISTP right now  but I really can t see INFJ  Inf Se where   Also not to mention that y all haven t even made a real argument  maybe I just didn t see it so if that s the case please tell me   but everything that I ve seen by INFJ voters for now was complaining about the Traveler having   profile so like    Anyways back to the point  the whole point of the Traveler here is to quickly adapt to their surroundings for example this voiceline   Paimon  You learn new things so quickly  Paimon  You ve already got such a good grasp of Teyvat s language   Traveler   You re a good teacher  Paimon  Paimon  Hehehe     Traveler   Who knows  maybe the quality of your nasty nicknames will improve someday   I understand that the Traveler is mostly a self insert character what makes them a lot harder to type but as I said  the whole point of them is to quickly adapt to their surroundings  They seem to have a great deal of Se  it s undeniable but fr  I don t know if y all started this INFJ thing because of their Ni usage in the new event but is it anywhere else except that event  I m not that sure because I quitted genshin   Also they can be a Ti dom and still help people  first of all they re very old  I guess all of their functions are developed and balanced by now but a Ti dom s main fear is the tribe not approving their ideas  They can overcome it by communicating their ideas  everyone approves the Traveler wanting to find their sibling  they love them  they love the tribe  I ll update this comment at some point but I just can t see why INFJ so I m writing this before it becomes the consensus lmao,istp
I think we saw a lot of traveler s tert Ni in the new event  but I wouldn t go so far as to say this is evidence they are INFJ  I can t really see Fe aux or Se inf  and I m having trouble finding arguments in here for it  Also why are some people saying they should have separate profiles  They have the exact same voice lines in game  unless I m missing something ,istp
no  the twins shouldn t have separate profiles  they have the exact same dialogue and make the same decisions in game  we also need to stop thinking about the dialogue options we choose  since our own thought process plays a part in that  look at their dialogue with paimon in their profile screen  i agree the abyss twin should have their own profile  but aether and lumine should share the traveler profile     i ve also seen someone argue  lumine is INFJ because her stats are better than aether s  this profile is a mess    ,istp
Whatever the cases  both travelers would have the same mbti  Mihoyo wont make them different in any way  Unless if mihoyo decides to make the evil twin have an actual personality then I won t mind for another profile for the abyss twin    Besides that  traveler s way of thinking and making decisions is really interesting  I wouldn t disagree INFJ nor ISTP  Im not sure if its Ti Ni or vice versa  but they definitely do have both of these functions together,istp
They showed more ni on the latest event  I think this is just the start of them showing more of their ni cause the lore is gradually getting twisted rn,istp
Is it just me or is traveler s ni rlly extreme in the recent dragonspine event   ,istp
Listen to me why INFJ makes the most sense for him  Ni  as we said he had a long term plan  his Ni Is clear  Now what are his other functions  Clearly Fe Ti  People here are mistaking Fe with his Sexual   enneagram  He never had his own values  even his mom said that we wanted to be an Hero just for Endeavor  just for his admiration  he absorbed Endeavor s value like a Fe user would do  Also seeing his revenge for publicly humiliating his father right in something he always wanted was to be the number one hero gives me indications that he used a Ti analysis combined with Fe  What are the arguments for Te  I don t see any Te in him  He Is a dissapointed and unhealthy INFJ  How can you consider him a Fi user when in the japanese version he said this   I m not saying everybody should be selfless and pure  Only you   That s a disappointed Fe user  him being egocentric and him wanting to be appreciated by his father comes from his   sx enneagram  I agree with Se inf arguments  since he never cared about his own body and got several injuries just to make Endeavor proud of him  Also enneagram   makes a lot of more sense for an INFJ than INTJ ,istp
Can someone explain why he is a fi dom  I don t see any te in his approach,istp
Why Sx  over Sp   He sounds way more reserved about his envious and frustrations  Sp  are quite prone to reacts at things and competes for their valued priorities ,istp
I am gonna explain why he s an INFJ  w    Ni  His long term plans and how he s future oriented clearly points out he s a ni user  Fe aux  he clearly gets what the others feel in use this in an unhealthy way to manipulate people  He used his Fe to understand what Endeavor and his mother truly thought about him  Ti  Even though he understands the values of his father he disagrees with them because of his own logical reasons  Se inf  Didn t care about his body in the past  I think he devoloped his se more in the present  I can see why so people think he s ISTP or ISFP since they both use Ni too but his Se inf Is so clear as a child   w  also fits him since he wanted to be recognized by his father  For INTJ  I don t see Te in him  looks more like he hates Endeavor s Te  About fi arguments  don t mistype enneagram   for Fi  he s egocentric but he never followed what was right to him  even his mom said  are you sure u really want to be an Hero   He just did what his father wanted  he absorbed his value as a Fe user would do ,istp
Is the only INTJ argument Ni Fi loop   Loop theory is made up by some guy on a personality forum to type people with personality disorders  it s not a reliable theory and lacks solid basis  The inferior Se argument is also incorrect  Not caring about bodily sensations   Inferior Se  because that s an Si thing  Se seeks the strongest sensory input and abides by the reality of sensations  It doesn t focus on bodily sensations but rather on adapting and reacting to sensory input   Planning   Ni dom  Dominant Ni users focus on the abstract essence of an object  something from the real world   form a vision out of it and transform it into their reality  I really don t see how Dabi s Ni would be stronger than his Fi  And his aim is not to accomodate to objective fact  Te  but rather to seek his own ideals  Fi    His Fi is actually just him being a Type    Enneagram and MBTI overlap often  one can t disprove the other unless you have an argument against Fi dom  So I m open to debate ,istp
This is just an idea that came into my mind while reading the manga  but what are the chances of Dabi being a Si user  His goals and motives comes from his past  his thinking is comparing his present to the past and generally  Dabi is someone who seems stuck in the past  Honestly I think Dabi being ISTJ or at least having Si tertiary would make so much sense  I first noticed it when he said  the past never dies   I m not      sure that he is a Si user but if you think about it it actually makes a lot sense  If you think the opposite feel free to explain why Se Si  I just couldn t get this out of my head ,istp
INTJ voters  please explain to me where is the Te aux  You guys are so focused on his Ni Fi ,istp
We do not have enough information to properly gauge Dabi s MBTI yet  Especially because his functions are used extremely unhealthily   All the arguments for inferior Fe  dom Fi  and inferior Se are moreso describing sexual Four  And although he likely is in one  loop arguments can t be the main basis of your argument  And you can t make your aux function disappear   Wait until we return to the Todoroki family subplot to get more info  especially since we still have blanks regarding how he became Dabi  and what he s been doing for ten years after Touya s supposed death before joining the League ,istp
This isn t supposed to be a big trump card for the Fi argument so don t take it as such i just find it interesting  We see a huge difference between the actual translation and caleb cooks personal writing especially when it s about the villains  Sometimes he will entirety change the meaning of the jp sentence   I m not here to complain this time tho    I just find the way in which Dabis speach to endeavor was so carefully crafted and the way in which he says things in jp shows so much Fi and understanding of Fe    Here s a link to a blog that explains the jp text  they also do it for many other bnha pages ,istp
When will people realize that not every IxxP type is an Fi dom  You guys know that Fi is supposed to be gentile and unassuming  he is literally confrontational and very blunt with his deeply held logic and beliefs  He is also a massive Ti user anyways given his personally logical focus and extraverting of feeling  even with it being his fourth function  Fe fourth can come as the most immature and unhealthy form of Fe since it doesn t have much awareness of those around them yet often want to express value sentiments that apply to everyone  but they see that often as impractical and therefore we only really see feeling expression at its most unhealthy  Fe inferior in grip seems whiney and emotional  Te grip on the other hand is the short while where Fi doms seem commanding and blunt  but usually theyre very soft and easygoing  Feeling function leads are just generally more caring about keeping harmony than Thinking function leads  compare him to an ISFP like Frank Ocean or Britney Spears and you ll see the difference clearly    ,istp
Those Fi dom votes do not make sense his Ti Se edginess is over the top and he reeks of inferior Fe  Tert Fe would also make some sense in theory   As stereotypical for a young guy  I was usually annoyed by people who show too much Fi in my childhood and I probably would have liked him less if he showed more or even if he was a Fi dom  He does show Fi more in some of his songs but it is still heavily influenced by Ti and Fe ,istp
Why would Em be sp   sx  He seems like a stereotypical counterphobic six to me ,istp
 And there s a million of us just like me Who cuss like me  who just don t give a      like me Who dress like me  walk  talk and act like me And just might be  the next best thing  but not quite me   Yep definitely   in the tritype,istp
What about ESTP  ISTPs are Ne blind and there are some arguments mentioning that his Ne is not as low as blind spot but I still don t think Ne is one of his first four functions  ESTP ,istp
Clear Fi Si loop in his raps specifically when talking about his mother and ex wife and daughter  Uses Ne as a catalyst for his creative word play and rhyming schemes  Rhymes orange with door hinge cmon now  ,istp
He just acts like a tough guy has a      ton of ne going for him the only reason you think he has ti is because of his eneagram being  w ,istp
Jokes and jokes and jokes and jokes and HA HA HAha ha  SPAGHETTI SPAGHETTI SPAGHETTI SPAGHETTI SPAGHETTI   MILE ,istp
RLUEN suits him more rather than RLUEI  He has no appreciation for art aesthetics  At least he is not known for that  nor is he interested in abstract concepts but rhyming  Also  his vocabulary is pretty average which also indicates his lack of interest in reading  A tough person  can endure extreme hardship though ,istp
How is he sp   He is icon of the sexual six ,istp
can someone tell me howwww he s a over e in big    ,istp
why v   l in ap   D just wanna know,istp
Can someone explain why he s ISTP  Using cognitive functions for their arguments  I d just like to understand the reasoning   I m not saying he s not ISTP  simply curious to know WHY he is  according to most people  ,istp
Makes sense that Ash is ISTP  I think he lead with Ti and Se and tahts why he is good at making fast judgements during crisis    And lastly he s Ti  Ni tends to analyze the situations and sometimes see the worst case scenarios   idk could be because he s     He also tends to detach himself in order to achieve a quick outcome  Mostly he tries to find the logical reasoning in the situations immediately along with hes Se  Hes Ni also seems to be a bit up but this could be because hes   as well  I think he tried to find conclusions about things in immediate environment and that s why he when he was in a panic situation he tried making a conclusion about the environment before taking any action fast,istp
how is he Accommodating over Egocentric  Being Egocentric doesn t make you a mean or bad person  it just means you re more focused on your self preservation,istp
The fact that Sx Sps can lose the sight of their role in groups and Ash literally said same thing in the ending   destroys me ,istp
why sp   instead of sx    ,istp
You know that one scene where she refuted the argument claiming that God doesn t exist with Ali  She was so headstrong in her stance using subjective logic about her grief  and couldn t comprehend the idea of her dad passing on is tied to some greater purpose or meaning  Especially when she said  Why does your life have a purpose but my dad s life doesn t   Honestly  I truly believe in God but I wouldn t dare try to debate about it with her if she were ever a real person  She s crystal clear Ti Se  although her Se is pretty unhealthy   She s very down to earth ,istp
Why is every ISTP so cool like wtf,istp
The most obvious sp sx  w  to sp sx  w     For Self Preservation Nines  it feels safer to take refuge in physical comfort  or in a routine that structures their experience in concrete and familiar ways  than to have to show up in the world and risk potential conflict or overstimulation  It s easier to erase yourself by losing yourself in comfortable activities than to reveal yourself or open yourself up to whatever unpredictable or complex thing might be happening in the outside world       Keep in mind she s the same girl who watched    straight hours worth of TV to avoid her problems  She didn t even bother getting up to use the bathroom or eat  She preferred to completely engross herself in superficial physical activities rather than cause any more conflict than there already was                                                                                   Sexual Nines are not connected to their own passion for living  in the good sense of the term  passion    and so they try to locate it by blending with another person  When they are in close relationships  they may have the sense that there are no boundaries between their experience and that of important others  The merging with the other takes the form of an energetic taking on of feelings  attitudes  beliefs  and even behavior  These Nines feel a sense of loneliness or abandonment that seems like it can only be filled by another person  whether or not they realize it consciously       Her entire   unhealthy   relationship with Jules  She has known the girl for a few weeks   I can t imagine them knowing each other for longer than a month    Despite that  she pretty much centered her entire existence around Jules   and even stayed sober solely because of her    and when she realized that Jules wasn t ready for that kind of intense commitment  she broke  Rue doesn t like herself or her life  so she tried to find meaning through another person  This is a textbook example of   merging   with another person ,istp
SLI       were we watching the same show    ,istp
Her Se seems to be the only part of her type getting any attention so I m linking a vid of her Ti Ni in action  https   www youtube com watch v ZxZwvWSYEVA,istp
ISTP to the core  High use of Se  almost none of it good ,istp
she s just like me fr    ,istp
i m wondering if she s RLUEN or RLUEI because i could see both non curious and inquisitive traits in her,istp
Mom  Phineas and Ferb are changing Ferb s type to ISTP ,istp
ISTP and ENTP perfect duo,istp
I don t see much Ne in this guy,istp
He reminds me of Chiaki from Danganronpa   and now I know why  ,istp
just because he s smart and quiet doesn t mean he s an INTP that s not how cognitive functions work  Ferb is all about building things and solving problems rather than delving deep into them  which is more of an Se trait than an Ne trait,istp
He s smart as hell but isn t interested in talking too much  he has more talents as people know  He is a healthy INTP,istp
FLVE fit s the tiniest bit better,istp
Somehow this makes so much more sense then INTP Ferb because even tho I thought INTP made sense  ISTP Ferb just clicks  That tertiary Ni makes so much more sense than auxiliary Ne ,istp
You do not need to necessarily have ne to be creative  Even then  these are traits that should not necessarily be used to fully type a character  Ferb is a great example of a ISTP who shows this and breaks the generalizations   It s pretty cool to see mbti types break stereotypes ,istp
Now i know why he is so awesome  ,istp
Nothing   core about him  he s pure    I m not convinced he even has a   wing  I see a lot of mockery  making light of everything  and  ish goofiness ,istp

Shrek is the first person to come to mind when I think of ISTPs ,istp
I m glad this is up  so i can see what the perfect personality combination looks like,istp
Shrek is an obvious ISTP   You see his use of Ti when Shrek points out logical fallacies in the actions of other people  In one of the first scenes of the movie  when Shrek was attacked by a mob of humans who feared him  one of the people warned his fellow mobsters that Shrek would  grind their bones and spread it on bread   Knowing full well that he doesn t eat humans himself  Shrek attacks the man s logic by obviously lying to him about what he does to his human victims  Shrek confirmed through his deception that humans would believe anything they are told if they are afraid of something  and that makes them malleable  Through Ti  Shrek got to understand how humans behave and how to get them away from him without violence  When Shrek and Donkey first visited Farquaad s castle town  Shrek tried to understand why Farquaad would need to live in a castle that is obviously too large and impractical for a single person to live in   Do you think he s maybe compensating for something   Shrek understands the procedure for interacting with humans   I m An Ogre  You Know   Grab Your Torch And Pitchforks    He formed a logical system of how humans are so influenced by their fear and tribalism that they use violence to rouse out that which they fear most   outsiders but especially ogres  He also assumes all humans are like this until he meets with Fiona  And even when he was with Fiona  Shrek also assumed that Fiona is afraid of and disgusted with Shrek as well  Shrek changes his logical framework as he gets more information on how some humans can actually come to love and respect ogres   Shrek s comparison of himself to onions is also his use of Ti   that he has multiple layers and he hides the most vulnerable and sensitive parts of his psyche away from the world  Donkey uses inferior Ti to point out how ogres and onions are similar on the surface  such as smell or coloration   Shrek pointed out what he meant on a metaphorical level   that ogres are not as simple minded as they are made out to believe  that Shrek himself is more complex and intelligent than others believe he is  That nobody should insult or fear him until they get to know him  Shrek uses Ti again with his banter with Fiona later on  When Fiona asked Shrek what type of knight he was  Shrek knew that he wasn t a true knight since he was an ogre  but that he was still a knight anyway because he actually did what other knights could not  and that was rescuing Fiona  His  one of a kind  knight response to her question is multifaceted   he is an ogre  he is not actually knighted  he does not act or behave like a stereotypical knight  and he saved Fiona s life when true knights could not  Prior to this  when Donkey asked whether Shrek s farting is the cause of the sulfuric smell  Shrek points out a logical fallacy that if Shrek actually did fart  the smell would overpower Donkey s nostrils and kill him  Shrek used Ti in his first on screen quote when he read about the fairy tale book of a knight rescuing a princess  Realizing the impracticality of fairy tale romance  Shrek dismisses the story entirely and makes practical use of the pages within as toilet paper   His Ti manifests as humor  but in other times it manifests as him getting clarification on the intentions of others  When Shrek formed his verbal contract with Farquaad to rescue Fiona for his swamp back  he wanted absolute assurance that Farquaad was going to obey his word right down to keeping the toadstools intact  He didn t want Farquaad to undermine him  In Shrek    Shrek uses Ti to devise a strategy to rescue Fiona with the help of the fairy tale characters he bonded with in Shrek    In Shrek    Shrek points out an obvious trap of pancakes in the forest to an unsuspecting Donkey   Shrek also has strong Se  The very first scene in Shrek   was him enjoying his swamp  showering  going to his outhouse  and harassing and pranking villagers  He has good kinesthetic awareness  as Shrek was able to overpower and defeat Farquaad s trained knights and combatants in a tournament despite his lack of training  He later navigated his way through Dragon s tower  survived multiple deadly encounters with Dragon  and rescue Fiona  Shrek bonds with Fiona by playing with her in nature and pranking  He enjoys burping  farting  and sensory humor  Shrek was able to ride Donkey  who was a white steed  to Harold s castle despite having no formal equestrian training  Shrek lives in the present and is very adaptable  Shrek goes on several fetch quests without any complaints or reservations  In Shrek    he misses pranking and scaring people so much that he made a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to get those days back ,istp
That ENTJ INFJ votes is pure gold,istp
the way keeps to his swamp certainly see a bit of ISFP  w ,istp
Shrek is love   Shrek is life   By the way    WHOEVER REMOVED THE SEXY PICTURE YOU I WILL FIND YOU AND WILL KILL YOU  ,istp
The very few people in Shrek s close inner circle see his Fi personal sense of moral responsibility  For the rest of the world  though  he s a textbook Si dom who s very irate because he doesn t get WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP    EDIT  Also  a lot of the arguments for Ti here are actually describing Te ,istp
if he stares at me like that any longer  i m gonna bust a nut ,istp
so glad that ppl r finally starting to realize that he isn t sp sx this man is such a sx  ,istp
this man is literally the definition of TiSeNiFe i don t care,istp
Why sp   According to Beatrice Chestnut   Self Preservation Sixes seek friendly connections and alliances  and to do this they endeavor to be friendly  trustworthy  and supportive as good allies are supposed to be  As Naranjo clarifies   not trusting themselves enough  they feel alone and incapable without outside support   Self Preservation Sixes want to feel the embrace of the family  to be in a warm  protected place where there are no enemies  They search for an  idealized other  for protection  and they can have issues that look like separation anxiety  Like a child who needs to hold on to the mother  these Sixes don t feel confident in defending their own self interests and survival      Her explaination of sx  fits Levi a lot better   The Sexual Six is the most counterphobic Six  the one who turns against the passion of fear by assuming a stance of strength and intimidation  Instead of actively feeling fearful  these Sixes have an inner belief that when you are afraid  the best defense is a good offense  As Naranjo explains  anxiety in this Six is allayed by skill and readiness in the face of a possible attack  They often appear bold and even fierce  They go against danger assertively  and even aggressively  as a way of denying and coping with their  often unconscious  fear   ,istp
I remember the scene from season   where he fought against kenny and hid in a bar behind the counter and then kenny entered  then levi saw a glass bottle in the shelf and turned it in order to see kenny s reflection without directly having to face him   Idk but isnt that actually Se  Ni as he recognizes small details and then uses his Ni or maybe Ti to make use of it in a rather unexpected way lol,istp
I told myself that I wasn t going to do this  but I can t hold it in       SELF PRESERVATION    Please miss me with that bullsh  t  Sp  s are well known for being WARM  FRIENDLY  AFFECTIONATE  and CHARMING in order to build alliances to feel safe  Yes  I understand that Levi might represent the sp fix by itself   without mixing in the enneagram    but it s not supposed to be that way  So  s are different from So  s  just like how Sp  s are different from Sp  s  You know why  Because you have to keep the ENNEAGRAM and core type in mind when you re picking out someone s IV      Extremely fragile on the inside  and even overly childish or immature about certain things and subjects  Always relying on others  authority  and loved ones  Indecisiveness and constant worry  SP s have a fear related to survival a fear of not being protected that fuels a driving need for protection through friendship and other kinds of alliances with others  They search for a community and try to keep friendships for protection  and they can have issues that look like separation anxiety  Like a child who needs to hold on to the mother  these  s don t feel confident in defending their own self interests and usually live according to their obligations and duties  These  s may seek to escape anxiety by delusions and imaginary scenarios  false worlds  and deceit  They have a passion for compensating for the fear of separation  which manifests as building sympathy and fitting in  There is a lot of hesitation  indecision  and uncertainty  They doubt themselves  and they doubt their doubt  Feeling uncertain and unable to find a satisfying sense of certainty  SP s have a difficult time making decisions  They are also prone to assuming or feeling the blame of others  Maybe an outcast within his society  and can like to show off  but often becomes cowardly in dangerous situations  Chuunibyou ish  Attempts to impress people in order to be protected or liked  accepted  May pretend to be courageous  but when faced with danger they fearfully retreat  or excessively friendly and giving as a way of preventing an attack from outside  Delusional mind and wild imagination  over thinking and over adventuring into fantasy  Usually skilled in their academics  but they tend to have moments of procrastination and avoidance of tasks  obligations  duties  Inclination to introjection   picking up traits from other people  like parents  relatives or friends  in order to  survive   their adaptation is focused on acting like normal people and common everyday people to not be rejected       To give some context  Peter Parker   from the MCU    is a sp    Peter         Parker  That doesn t sound right  does it  However  sx can easily fit Levi         Rejection of fear and worry  transformation of anxiety and insecurity into pride and vanity  haughty perceptions and distortions of reality within their own conscience  Assumes that people did things they did not  projects doubts and thoughts into what is real  often seeing themselves as strong  beautiful  leaders  They fear nothing and wrathfully react to things  They try to keep a calm and cold composture  Strong confidence in themselves and conviction in their actions  perceives people as subordinates and may be demanding of them  idealizes themselves and their partners or friends  Shows great respect and admiration for people if they decide that the persons are deserving of rewards  Assumptions and assumptions  but the SX  keeps his mind on logic and calculus  Attachment to power and tends to ponder about most things  Usually paranoic  suspiciousness is a characteristic trait of this subtype  the SX  keeps an eye on his partners and friends  everyone and their own surroundings  SX  wants to be able to tell if someone is hiding something from them or not  Tests the loyalty of people  Does not like lies  Dunning Kruger effect may be common  If the world is dangerous to the   overall  then the SP  relies on people and relationships in order to feel safe  and the SX  relies on himself and believes that he is an authority  or at least very capable of becoming one  therefore safety would be permanent  But it isn t  and safety is often attacked by the possibility of people being enemies disguised as friends  So the SX  can be quite asocial due to this  Anxiety in this   is allayed by skill and readiness in the face of a possible attack  They often appear bold and even fierce  They go against danger assertively  and even aggressively  as a way of denying and coping with their  often unconscious  fear  They have a passion for searching for or securing a position of strength  power and control  These  s display a forcefulness that comes from not wanting to be weak  they avoid vulnerability and dislike being open to people  They are unfriendly at times  ,istp
There is no way this man is a sp    sp   s are known for using their fear to seek out allie s and therefor acting warm to people for the sake of protection  they often seek alliances and reassurance  sx   fits way better as sx  s take their fears and act against it  appearing tough and not expressing their fear  armin is a good example of a sp    levi is most likely an sx  ,istp
 Edit  I m not against subtypes at all  I ve just been thinking that maybe they are taken way too seriously  That s all   For anyone not voting sp sx  Guys  why are we so reliant on subtype descriptions   There s way too many different opinions on them  Beatrice chestnut  Riso and Hudson  etc    sp dom makes sense for him as a person  sx doms seek intensity and connection and I think that lesser importance to him imo ,istp
Ackermans by their very nature are the embodiment of self preservation   ,istp
I think he s an ISTJ  A lot of people here are voting him as ISTP  but Ackerman instincts   Se  His SJ temperement is clearly seen throughout each season ,istp
INTJ voters are you sane  Levi is the most ISTP character ever  A Ti dom character with perfect tactics  extroverted sensing rather than introverted  If you think he s a team player  he s just has well developed fe ,istp
Why Non curious  Sure  Jotaro may be highly practical and pragmatic  but he also has a wide array of theoretical interests like Marine Biology and Detective Work he delves into for the sake of it  I don t understand why his openness would be particularly low  is it just because he s a Sensing type  Also I m pretty sure having a   in your tritype  anywhere  is an automatic indicator for at least moderate openness ,istp
What type do you think his wife would be ,istp
Base Ti is not just adherence to structure  Jotaro is highly focused and observant  and remarkably quick to act  SLI is an IP type  less rigid  and most importantly  Delta  Jotaro for sure does not demonstrate base Si  as well  Look to Yoshikage Kira for ego Si  Even if he s off his rocker  Kira has detailed rituals and preferences at the forefront of his character  Jotaro almost seems to exist purely to fight evil  and his lack of Fe isn t an issue  as strength of functions are the same in LSI and SLI   The difference lies in values  then  and Jotaro does not ignore Se,istp
ISTP but good at brainstorming  It s an INTJ,istp
Can somebody explain to me how he is     instead of    ,istp
I really don t get why people are voting for him to have a   fix  ,istp
Why Jotaro is  w  and not  w    genuine question ,istp
He s basically a stereotype of Fe PoLR but still voted as LSI just because ISTP and LSI are  similar  function wise ,istp
Can we actually call him the ISTP stereotype itself ,istp
  I d like to contribute this comment to  HairesLuciens    Firstly  an innocent and genuine comment appears suggesting that  s can only be extroverted  as naranjo s description of them is very much externally stimulus focused  instinctive and rejects the process of abstraction and  inwardness   Not too long later it received major rejection of the public eye  yet no replies were found to present a counter argument  This caught my attention  so I ve decided to bring this opinion back to the surface of the people to decide whether or not they agree or not     Secondly  you are free to dislike  but I would be more than happy to see an argument back or some kind of response to this  I am open minded to opinions     I will now present the piece of text that my argument mainly sits on  of course I got plenty of other arguments but this text will give you the  take it from him not me  kind of message      The characteristic orientation of ennea type VIII to a graspable and concrete  here and now  the sphere of the senses and the body sense in particular is a lusty clutching at the present and an excited impatience toward memory  abstractions  anticipations  as well as a desensitization to the subtlety of aesthetic and spiritual experience  Concentration on the present is not simply as a manifestation of mental health as it could be in other character dispositions  but the consequence of not deeming anything real that is not tangible and an immediate stimulus to the senses       Jungian definition of  Introversion    introversion means an inward turning of libido  q v    in the sense of a negative relation of subject to object  Interest does not move towards the object but withdraws from it into the subject  Everyone whose attitude is introverted thinks  feels  and acts in a way that clearly demonstrates that the subject is the prime motivating factor and that the object is of secondary importance        The indolent aspect of the lusty may be under stood not only as a feeling of not alive enough except through over stimulation but also in a concomitant avoidance of inwardness  We may say that the greed for ever more aliveness  characteristic of the lusty personality  is but an attempt to compensate for a hidden lack of aliveness       though also similar in some regards  such as in the thirst for intensity    the former  type    reaches out without guilt towards the satisfaction of its need       Introversion prefers ideals and ideal thoughts about the outer world  formed by the subject s own mind  isolated from its environment  The process of introversion is that of abstraction  which means that it takes information and grasps its most salient aspects  and forms or cognizes a general archetype  prototype  or model  Plato s Forms come to mind here  For example  there are a totality of different individual dogs in the outer world  but they all appeal to the perfect idea of  dog ness   Each dog is an imperfect imitation of the ideal dog  the form of dog  the one true quintessential dog  Maybe the philosophical Youtuber  exurb a  summarized it best  This is a cat  this is a cat  this is a cat also  They re all different cats but we still get that they re cats  so there must be a perfect cat living in some perfect realm above us that all cats are made from  ,istp
After seeing her own movie it seems to me that her childhood is more of the one of   with a   fix  She was so young but she already knew what her  parents  were up to  Also  according to record of crimes and her guilt about her violent past makes me think she was focused more on self preservation  and later on she learned how to warm up to groups and adhere to their causes ,istp
i see her more as a social    esp after black widow  can anyone explain why sx      i mean i can kinda see it  cp w  can look a lot like   on the surface bar the fact that they re usually MORE aggressive than so  w s  but looking at the little we ve seen of natasha s motivations desires i really think   is more of a fix for her,istp
I think she s an ISTJ  w   even though her personality tends to shift depending on what movie you watch  Here is my reasoning for the MBTI  I   well  I m pretty sure that the fact that she s an introvert is pretty well known  She s fine with being by herself and doing her own thing  She actually seems to enjoy it more than being around others  which is why she is often seen doing her missions herself and not exactly wanting to interact with others   S   this was honestly slightly more of a guess on my part  I was in between ISTJ  INTJ  and INFJ  but I thought that the first was the most likely with the combined letters   T   she seems to be less emotional and more thinking  Her decisions generally have more of an analytical  She seems to have a mindset of not caring if someone else s feelings get hurt or if they feel betrayed  not saying all thinkers are like this  it s just more of a thinker thing to do  as long as she thinks something will turn out well  Like how she didn t inform Captain America that she was planning to do at the start of CA TWS because she thinks that no matter if it hurts him  it s for the greater good   J   she seems pretty planned and organized  Not saying that Ps can t be good at planning  but she seems to try to plan for the long term   Now for  w   As I already stated with thinkers  she s very analytical  organized  doesn t enjoy the company of people  and likes to solve mysteries  I realize that many people say  w  and I think that is true in some of the movies  but in most all of them I thinks she s a  w    I m not going to go through all the lines she says that can prove that she s a  w  and ISTJ  However  this line I thought had a lot of ISTJ  w  energy   I only act like I know everything  Rogers    Natasha Romanoff CA TWS  Thanks for reading ,istp
Now I see why Clint and Natasha got along so well,istp
But why   Fix  I see her with more   fix ,istp
Definitely the ISTP female stereotype  stoic  extremely physical  quick thinking and problems center around human drama  Her world is her thinking  her ideas  her motives and is willing to put her goals aside to support the greater good and the motives of the Avengers Friendships  Extremely talented in Se and able to balance the Se Ni in the middle to break down the sensory into a singular focused Ni direction  Definitely my favorite character in the MCU  a regular  especially talented human who can hold her own alongside superhumans and demigods ,istp
Seeing the consensus  I wonder if viewing only her own movie is sufficient to type her  I m also not an Avengers enthusiast so maybe my mind went wrong  So my argument is only based upon the new movie   Seeing her as an IS P is evident   she is an introverted judger and she uses many Se Ni  But I didn t see any Ti  or not enough for being her dominant function  Do you see her Fe as her willingness to free the other girls caught by Dreykov  I personally think it is a Fi use because it is a thing she judges as awful  thought control and all the stuff  and she has the desire to put an end to it  Fi users can also be thankful if the others do something that help them in their personal goal  When younger at the beginning of the movie  she also appeared as rather emotional   wanting to be better than her sister when they handstand  and telling it to her to let her know  and going to anger when they have to go to the Red Room because she wants to stay in Ohio ,istp
i m VERY new to socionics i m still learning and everything but the other day i was reading stuff about SLI and she just popped in my head like  oh this could be nat s  but she s typed as LSE  which i m not disagreeing nor agreeing with just can someone explain why is she LSE ,istp
I haven t watched Black Widow stand alone but I m sure as hell she s not social blind ,istp
Think I gotta disagree with this one  Maybe her personality differs in later adaptions and I haven t watched this in a while lol   Disney Princesses tend to be full of Fi and Mulan was no different   Her character progression and actions are backed by what she feels is the right thing to do  She s purely led by her values rather than what she thinks is personally logical  and she doesn t wait for things to make sense to her before doing it as being compelled is enough for her   A Ti dom would be much more reluctant to pose as a male in the army because of all the risks like death  getting caught  and even death from getting caught    I also think inf Te makes betters sense for her than inf Fe  for sure  To me it seems that whatever the orientation of her T function  it stacks lower than F ,istp
I feel like there should be separate typings for Mulan        and Mulan II         since the writing was obviously inconsistent  I can agree      Mulan was ISFP but not      Mulan ,istp
 omg she s so badass she must be an ISTP   she s clearly a fi dom,istp
she did what she believed was right despite what other people thought and in the second movie her and shang clashed because she made decisions based on her heart rather than her head how is that not fi,istp
in the second movie she s the epitome of fi dom lmao who wrote her   ,istp
I haven t watched the movie in years  so do take this with a grain of salt  but if I recall correctly  she is far more inclined towards understanding herself and emotions   When will my reflection show who I am    as well as following her personal moral code  literally robbing her dad of his obligations because she believes in sacrificing herself first  even if it contradicts social values  which it does  I don t see how she forms any internal logic systems or follows what makes sense to her  I mean  isn t the entire point of her character that she is someone who stands strong within her beliefs despite the very obvious risks and societal disapproval   Although she has moments in which she displays strong strategic thinking  I would rather attribute that to a strong control over her inferior Te rather than having Ti as her dominant function because these moments are entirely goal oriented  rooted in the physical world  and are concerned with efficiency rather than making sense of things   I m not saying that Ti users cannot have Te traits or use Te and vice versa  but I believe it is more likely that she is a well developed ISFP rather than an ISTP that only applies her Ti in Te moments  from what I remember  and who also displays no struggle in using her inferior function  assuming Fe inferior is the struggle to set aside logic to care about understand other people   To me  it s quite obvious that one solution is far simpler  and therefore more likely  than the other  which requires some unnecessary mental gymnastics to justify   Of course  I am open to other explanations opinions  I could be way out on a limb here considering I haven t seen the source material in years ,istp
Just because she joined the army doesn t make her an ISTP      I see no T in her   more F    she was driven by her feelings in order to do service in place of her dad  She got a Ni in her for the inexplainable gift of Chi that she knew she got but finally learned to make use of it ,istp
My favorite Disney Princess,istp
I thought that she was a  ,istp
She is a standard ISFP  I mean  Ti dom  Where is her Ti dom  She is all about emotions  Plus  she is depicted a bit dreamy in the beginning  something hardly expected from an ISTP  And there ISFP comes in   The rest you can read from DonshipMopsey  No need to add more ,istp
Although Jun Ho s characterization is fairly minimal  his whole mission was a renegade act  where he makes things up on the fly as he goes along  This is not very much like an ESI with Ni mobilizing  and more like an SEE with  D Ni ,istp
He cant be Si ego type anyway  He screams Se ,istp
definitely not a ni dom  his se is wayy too high for that  I would say ISTP with very developed ni  Also doing things for a family member self related reason isn t fi lol,istp
Pretty ballsy dude infiltrating a death game  Lots of impulsiveness characteristic of Se and pretty developed Ti Ni in his ability to deduce that there was even a death game in the first place  Also I doubt  s would even want to risk their lives in anything worthwhile as they are more about absorbing knowledge for the sake of it without even putting it into action most of the time  His   is shown by not only trying to find evidence  but to rescue his brother and to stop all operation as a whole in a counterphobic way   s are way more clinical when it comes to stuff like that and they are not the type to even fight for themselves  just sayin ,istp
And who in their right mind voted this guy  the guy who rushes into everything without a plan  who acts impulsively on opportunities without considering the consequences  without planning in advance  an ISTP sp  w  SLI     I m gonna go with ESTP SEE for him ,istp
 w  doesn t make sense  His need to find his brother gives a hint that he is in need of support and a community to identify with  That s a   trait ,istp
i just noticed like half the ppl thirsting for him in this comment section are ISFPs  anyways waayyyyy too improvisational to be a ni dom,istp
why SLI  there wasn t too much to his character but his extreme faith in his police team despite it being hinted that they were incompetent leads me to think he could be faintly ethical  probably low intuition ,istp
 If you can satisfy me in five minutes  I might let you live   Such an ISTP mood   ,istp
i thought he s basically fi fe please could someone explain that    ,istp

Why is there   in his tritype  Can someone explain  I really don t see any   in him,istp
Not even Sherlock could figure the mystery of where the INTP voters see Ne ,istp
R I P  the opinion of people who think he is an INTP lol   On another note  his Temperament DCNH subtype is switched with Watson   His Melanholy Normalizing side is prevalent everywhere  he has a constant chill and thoughtful with a dash of sorrow presentation   When he was once almost proved wrong and a young person was in danger of getting hanged wrongly  he was gloomy with the specific Melanholic sensitivity  Fi accentuation in Primary Normalizing subtypes  ,istp
why is he      more specifically  why   fix ,istp
Where tf is his ne                   ,istp
ne blinded behavior  consumes morphine on daily basis ,istp
i can t handle these INTP votes    in the book sherlock is clearly uses se and ni  so let me explaing my idea  firstly as i read he is really good at catching the details  a se blind  INTP  can t catch this details this much because they aren t living in the moment and so bad at noticing appearances  secondly he is not generating more ideas  he is focusing what he found    i couldn t give spesific example because it s been a long time    And finally i want to mention that he is quite good aware with his senses as i remember ,istp
Ofc he s an ISTP  Se isn t just an impulsive function or smth like that  it s about seeing reality how it is  with no filters  concrete and objectively  different from Ne which is a concept observer   Why Sx   tho ,istp
Uhm how is not sherlock a ISTP    Definitely a ti user and a single decider as he seeks to value personal reason and absolutly ignore tribe values    Seems a double observer doesn t seem concerned with gathering patterns but arranging them    Seems to gather plain data and not concerned with arranging it    Arguments can be made for ESTP  if not stereotype them  but him having a balenced ti fe seems not right even if we include it him having a weak ni and only depending upon gathering plain data shows that he cannot be a ESTP  Socionics  How is he a LSE  Note There might be different version of Sherlock with different types because of writer and writing inconsistencies ,istp
I can t see him as an ISTP  He has just too much Ne for it  I am currently Reading  The Sign of Four  and he constantly uses Little Details he observes  Si  and finds different ways to connect them to guess the truth about his cases  He himself says at one part that he doesn t seek for one singular truth  Ni   but rather looks at different possibilities and how things could have been  This is the very basic of Ne  which is also the result he is so scattered and chaotic at times  In order to still be right in the end  he uses his Ti and analyses  which of the possibilities he sees is the most logical  Interestingly he is also quite random with the ideas he comes up and often don t looks at how he can properly execute them practical ,istp
I think people are kind of misunderstanding sixes as a whole here and weird instinctual subtype doesn t help but I think she s a counterphobic six  sx sp  w   while  yeah  being suspicious isn t a six only trait  she and her motivation isn t exactly rooted in curiosity  she does describe herself as a  guardian   a  protector   not really someone in pursuit of sense and their place in the world  plus   specialist  are usually sixes  I think she s way too practical and socially involved  in terms of being connected to her nation as a whole  not socially extroverted  to be a five   she considers it her duty to guard monstadt and assigns it to herself point blank  and while it s true   fives aren t necessarily nerds and geeks  they are information and knowledge oriented and rosaria doesn t particularly go into deep technical details about ways of torturing people tbh she s more of  what gets the job done  type  down to earth and practical as sixes  not fives  often are   her being a five is a nice take but honestly it just feels like overcomplicating things  IMO she s just your typical sx six rebel who s loyal and is overly protective over this one thing that gives them security and purpose  for rosaria it s monstadt and it s way of life,istp
Is there any argument for      It s not that I don t see it but I also could see   working for her  The way that she s constantly distancing herself from others and avoiding relationships with the people of Montsdadt could be a manifestation of   s avarice but I don t really know much about Rosaria,istp
This is probably gonna be an ignored comment and people are gonna still think unexpressive  SLI  but her socionics type is completely wrong  SLI is no sense for her   She obviously values TiSe and she isn t Se ignoring at all  she tries to assert herself to go and overwork everyday at the expense of her comfort  She also does not care to form a positive and comforting environment  SiNe axis   she cares a lot about work ethics and is distrustful by people s kindness  devalued FiSi   Also SLIs still have Ne seeking  Rosaria is extremely stubborn and closed minded on her opinions on people and her ways  I could see a case for ESI  however I think she s an extremely logic focused person and I can t see Fe at all  not even as an ignoring function   D Fe makes sense  its the only point for SLI  but the rest of the model does not match at all,istp
Why Rosaria  V  She is not interested in promoting her own interests and avoids people for the sake of comfort  But  E is justified by the fact that she is looking for the value of the world around her without an emotional basis ,istp
can somebody explain  w  ,istp
 im going to post the second part in the replies because pdb has a character limit  has anyone considered  w  for her  though I definitely see the arguments for    I still believe it s the second one in her tritype instead of her core  with   instead of  say     her tritype would also indicate double withdrawn  which  though not really an argument  still makes a lot of sense  if she turns out to be e  as i suspect  the consensus   core votes also prove true the debate of distinguishing sixes and nines  as well as why they even get mistyped in the first place   one of the most prominent things about her that everyone knows is that she ll do the dirty work just to get it done and over with  she wont complain and even offer to finish the job first  i see it as her just trying to mind her own business and avoiding unnecessary issues problems  doing what she s supposed to for the greater good  she isn t too pushy nor anxious  very accepting of her environment and unconcerned about most other things  almost all of her known free time activities include things that are relaxation methods for her  and even if enneagram was boiled down just to simple core fears desires  which it shouldnt be by the way  it would still fit her  whilst the same cannot be said for the six arguments  she s on her own and doesnt want any disturbance after work  she has a personal line between those two  how is this not type   behaviour   the primary defense mechanism for  s is narcotization    a psychological defense mechanism in which nines unconsciously numb themselves to avoid something that feels too large  complex  difficult  or uncomfortable to handle  nines narcotize and distract themselves by engaging in prolonged rhythmic activities that are familiar   require very little attention      we rarely see rosaria in a bad state  if ever  but that isn t necessarily because she hides it from people  I think she s constantly pushing her emotions away from everyone including herself  for example  it s mentioned in her character description and one of her storylines that in order to survive  she had to fight  steal   do other jobs for the people that took her away from her home  as a child  she obviously had to put her personal problems and feelings away for this  numbing herself as she does now because it s engraved in her brain that those emotions are probably something that just stands in the way of finishing her tasks  nines in general tend to suppress their emotions for the sake of avoiding inner conflict and powerlessness in the life they ve steadily built up for themselves    despite rosaria being a hard worker  she  similarly to many nines  is perceived as  lazy  by other sisters and mondstadters alike   people know her as the lazy  chain smoking sister  but behind the scenes  she is a formidable purveyor of justice    story     yes  rosaria does avoid quite a lot of things  but that s because she doesn t see it as beneficial or necessary  to someone who doesn t know her intentions for doing so  this kind of behaviour can make the impression that she is  lazy   when in reality  she simply isnt as fired up as other people are about certain things  therefore appearing as dispassionate  the reason for why nines are often seen as lazy by their peers is because of the lack of self  it s like their life is a blinding fog  they just are  for a lot of people who work with nines  they can feel as if they re not even present  physically AND emotionally  this could very well be the reason why it s so hard to connect with rosaria  we ve yet to seen a character she is actually open with or enjoys their presence  besides drinking with kaeya or barbara constantly nagging her  ,istp
Edit  Upon further research  I m open to her possibly being core   or    I ll still keep my vote  but either way  she s not a six   I think Rosaria might be enneagram        makes no sense  How on earth could she be core compliant attachment  Is it because she s suspicious   I ll come up with a more comprehensive argument later when college isn t kicking my ass  but it would make sense for her to be core five  withdrawn competency type      s are mistaken to be the nerd type  when at their core  the main issue for them is  competency   Their core fear is helplessness   The difference between  s and  s is that  s believe they can only trust themselves  which is why they withdraw from others  while  s feel that they cannot trust themselves  which is why they attach and comply to an external source  other people beliefs etc  ,istp
Does anyone have an idea about her enneagram  Ngl she s pretty difficult to type compared to say  Diluc ,istp
Rosaria is so honest with herself that she s come to hate some of the other nuns at the institution  as she doesn t like to talk to the crowd  let alone appear in front of the camera a lot  basically being the center of attention   She considers that her job in the City of Liberty is not to entertain people  not least because Barbara covers them so well  but to see if there is ever any potential threat to Mondstadt and her people  always working in the shadows and running away from much of her own  daily tasks  just to do your kind of service  Few people manage to hide something from Rosaria  because she has a very strong intuition and can see about it  His detachment from church traditions and his lack of devotion to Archon Anemo is evident throughout the plot  Rosaria  for example  finds Barbara irritating for following the rules  and doesn t like practicing with the other sisters in the choir  She also refers to the archon by the name Barbatos  unlike the citizens of Mondstadt  She however is very different from her companions  for the dark and mysterious air that surrounds her  Known for her sharp tongue and cool personality  She doesn t participate in anything she doesn t want to do  nor does she participate in things she considers boring  This gives her a rather lazy appearance on the surface when she is observed neglecting her church duties by her sisters  However  Rosaria s personal reasons for neglecting her duties are because she considers herself responsible for investigating threats to the city ,istp
I feel like Rosaria isn t a   or   in my opinion just because she s  lazy  doesn t mean she s a   we have to really look into the fears of the enneagram and how they become desires in my opinion to find out a characters enneagram so can y all stop saying she s a   or   or   because she s  lazy  or some other dumb reason,istp
shows the middle finger to paparazzi   ISTP,istp
Tyler   shes a f cking piece of sh t Kendall      that s really nice  Kendall babysitting   i literally don t know what to do I m sweating already   there s a lot of information being thrown at me but it s okay if my sisters can do it I can do it too I just have to keep the baby alive   Idk maybe ISFJ i see no Te on her at all  but ISXX sp first definitely,istp
Wow      agreement on  I  and  S   ISTJ makes the most sense tho ,istp
She is definitely not Calm  She has a lot of anxiety and panic attacks  She is very prone to negative feelings and has frequent mood swings  She has even talked openly about dealing with anxiety and how it has affected her work and personal life ,istp
almost half of the comments are voting her as ISTJ   as we should be   but why is it in  rd rank      i mean ISTP and ISFP voters why   ,istp
me trying to find kendall s Fe                 ,istp
stop bringing up old videos of kendall jenner in where she was being rude or   pick me    she clearly have changed  look at her new Vogue video  the aura she has is so much lightly now,istp
an add on to my brief explanation around   or so comments down  im starting to even more so realize how much of a strong   fix she has  the more i think about it  the more i think she might even be a core      i feel like the main explanation for her   fix is her being a  pick me  and trying to be  not like other girls  but its so much deeper than that  she so perfectly fits the sp   description  theyre the  long suffering  type  and take pride in having to struggle in their lives  while projecting their insecurities onto others  these fours have  their envy is focused on that which supports bodily survival and the sense of disconnection from all that supports life  such that they need to work to secure it     kendall always tries to make us think that being a jenner and born into fame makes her life  hard   she constantly complains about ppl assuming she didnt work hard to get to where she is bc of her family s connections and wants us all believe that her fame makes her work twice as hard as other models   even tho we all already know thats bunch of bs and shes a direct product of nepotism    in this clip kendall lashes out at caitlin for planning to attend the vs show out of fear that it ll make ppl think the only reason why she booked the show is bc of caitlin   a lot of ppl assume that i get jobs from my family  but its kinda the opposite  it made me have to work even harder to get what i wanted  so i get scared that if my dad goes  thats kind of a media frenzy     based on literally all of her interviews regarding modelling or rly anything in general  its like she wants us to appreciate and acknowledge the struggles shes had to go through  even with those vogue anxiety interviews  she wants us all to be aware that she has anxiety and that it makes her life difficult   her envy towards kylie and other successful models is also something i should mention   since the beginning we ve been super selective about which shows i would do  i was never one of those girls that would do like    shows a season  or whatever the      those girls are doing   also  itzkeisha has many interesting points about kendall being one of kylies biggest haters in one of her yt videos which ive linked right here   enneagram aside  WHY ARE PPL STILL VOTING ISXP   lmk what you guys think tho ,istp
Guys she s a phlegmatic sp    they can look like  w ,istp
WAIT HOW THE      IS SHE AN TI DOM  HOW  WHERE  NO ,istp
I notice some of y all think that Guts is an Fi dom  and I can tell you he isn t  the reason why I think this is because the main reason why he fights is for other people  not for himself  he actually can t live with himself if he doesn t as seen in the Conviction Arc  He uses Se in a very strategic manner  which to me indicates that he has a very logical approach then it comes to his external environment  indicating Ti  He also has a huge Ni moment in the Bonfire of Dreams piece in the Golden Age arc  which is actually something I never see a whole lot with ISTP characters  which is why I really enjoy Kentaro Miura s writing  it is extremely realistic ,istp
Are yall sure hes not a   that disintegrates to   during battle and when having trumatic flashbacks  His type of revenge comes in a pattern of oh you dare disturb my inner peace  The thing is he is very disturbed as he is and hasnt had that inner peace in years and the slightest misbehaviour from strangers puts him on edge and gets him all anxious and      jumpy  lol something donovan would say,istp
Okay     unpopular opinion  I think he is a Fi dom and not Ti dom  I m thinking ISFP but an unhealthy one  He has a lot of emotion but struggles to express it healthy  He acts like an ISTP but he really isn t  Everything he does is guided by Fi   Unhealthy ISFPs are really dark  I m sorry but Guts has so much feels throughout the entire manga  He s just basically a badass Tsundere ISFP lol  He would be a      Seeker type    trying to find who he is in a world of shame and anger  He feels safer in a group but his trauma also makes him very insecure ,istp
I think the motives behind his behavior and his inner character monologue leans more towards   like traits over   like traits  Despite him and the Falcons climbing up to the popularity ranks  he showed little interests to that and was more bothered about his life s purpose  let alone focus on the world of insights  tertiary ni   It was something he s never thought to make sense of and has never had the time to make sense of either  up until this point   This was the initial reason why he left in the first place  there was a missing link and neither Griffith  Casca or the band of mercenaries could help find it for him  This was soul searching he had to do himself  He sought out for an entire year  the meaning in his life and what he desires do with it    Even if it meant refusing to come back until he was secure enough in knowing where his position stands in the group of mercenaries  he would prefer taking that option  Cause  as we saw from his backstory  he s always been conflicted with the feeling of being out of place and that lack of security seems to bother him   He only fights  because it was all he has ever known  simply put  Since birth  Guts was forced into a life of circumstances  in which he has no choice  but to fight  Not for power   materialism and control of others but for the benefit of his own survival  That was what he was taught by his foster father  Gambino  During his growth  his focus became binoculars for caution cause at every step of way  danger met him  You even see this in his mannerisms  when he s resting beside his sword   His distrust and inability to open up to others as easy  his cynicism and   living life on the edge  antics  seeking out vengeance after the Eclipse  killing every living apostle possible  in the Blackswordsman plotline  is all just an attempt to put up a wall of toughness    He s had this mindset his whole life so then imagine  the one time he properly experiences the closest thing to what it s like to have a group of people that actually care about him  sacrificed right in front of his eyes in that very split moment  This would only reinforce this defense mechanism further  keeping avoidance of others  cause he does not wish to relive those events again   He lives his life believing that if he s vulnerable  just for one second and oncoming threats appear when he least expects it  then he s in trouble  He even misses days to weeks of sleeping  knowing that his brand attracts Apostles and otherworldly entities to him ,istp
Guts is not a    He wants to looks like a   as a metter of necessity  but inside he don t care for materialism archives and is not naturally assertive as prominence  Would an   really let Griffith say  You belong to me  and go along with it  Ok  he bet his life in the duel  but all of this just show how insecure he was to keep an image of strength  inside he was critical  depressed  don t know his place and wanted something to follow until he finds what he wants and have internally consistency for himself  even being skeptical about the process  After some years he lefts the Bands of the Hawks because he wants more strength  but don t wants an life of pure satisfaction of materialism archives  he wants to finds an real purpose for why he keeps fighting and be secure with himself  And after some time  he go back to Hawks to helps Griffith because he inside knows that he finds an loyal and secure place with them  An place that he can finally trust  and with then he can finds an purpose for him  All of these decisions who only makes sense for himself is typical common for  sx   In summary   sx also adds up with this criticism  doubts  need for some unknown purpose and security that has been repeatedly lost  compensating for this with strength    like wrathful  behaviour   He don t wants to trust in fate or prophecy  but inside he is anxious and is quite insecure about these things  so he physically reacts at situations and wants to develops strength  What he always wanted  even being distrustful about  is an secure place to belong and an more meaningful life to live  not just fighting for pure survival and materialism and be okay with It  he finds it an empty lifestyle  ,istp
his name is literally Guts he s in the gut triad you guys   lol   EDIT  I have given this a lot more thought and have decided he is sp sx  w   w     If we assume the second instinct applies to the wing  he has the sx   trait where he merges with the agendas of other characters  such as when he forgot his own dream so that he could go along with Griffith s  His merging with the group seemed to be coming from an instinctual place rather than a sychophantic longing for security which is what you see in actual  s like Casca  Wanting security is a secondary concern for him  sp sx is self explanatory and so is sp   ,istp
In which universe is guts SLI  He never once showed care for his body or comfort  He requires others to give him a purpose and a deeper meaning  He absolutely hates weaklings  after the Eclipse   His mindset is extremely beta ST  and I don t see Ti base or structure  He s just all about force and willpower  struggle to push onwards  to fight against fate  Guts   So long as I have my sword to fight with  I m sure to survive  Year after year I prove it to be true  Before joining the Hawks  I always survived  no matter the odds  no matter how hopeless a losing battle  This time was no different  ,istp
He s is so   Sx that s hurts  He is rebellious  disagreeable  restricted with his critical thoughts  suspicious about things  fights a lot and need to feels more strength  but inside he is insecure and not knows his place ,istp
I am gonna say that guts volition should in the unconcerned because he was never the type of person who has a clear goal for the majority of his life and follow grith to complete grith goals only until grith mentioned that he considered someone who follow his dreams instead of following others is his equal that is when guts started concerning himself with what he personally wants for his goals either way is volition is either  v or  v but I think  v fits what do you guys think,istp
i have doubts about her socionics and temperament tbh  i don t have great knowledge of socionics but i don t really see Fe PoLR  i bet she s typed SLI bc Denki IEE duality  when Denki isn t really Fi valuing but ok  but i see more Fe than Te creative  i think she s a SEI but since im learning about socionics i am not sure  as for her temperament i don t see the choleric blend  at first she was typed choleric first literally bc she was a bit aggressive  but i read the manga and no way she is a choleric lmao  maybe phleg sang     im really not sure but of someone has arguments for socionics or temperament write it below  i wrote this very poorly but whatever,istp
Anyone know where I can find some decent arguments for Ti vs Fi dominant  I ve been scrolling a lot and I m mostly just finding people either trashing others for voting ISFP  or people voting ISFP because she has feelings  I m pretty confident in her enneagram and socionics type  mostly just debating her mbti at this point since I can make decent arguments for inferior Te and inferior Fe ,istp
To all ISFP voters where is Te inf ,istp
When I finish reading the manga  I ll come back and make an actual argument for her bc all I see in this comment section is people making fun of ISFP voters instead of arguing Ti   For now  if anyone is wondering where her Ti is  go visit her profile in https   myheroacademia fandom com wiki Kyoka Jiro Personality I m sure you ll get it ,istp
It s funny to see that people still think someone is a Feeler just because they showed emotions a few times  Y all don t realize that thinking personalities can also show emotions sometimes  They re not robots  Even when it comes to decision making   You can clearly see that her Ti is stronger than her Fe or Fi no matter how you look at it    She s an ISTP  Clear as day ,istp
I usually don t like comparing two different Characters but I feel like bringing it up    Mr  Aizawa and Shinso are actual ISTP Characters with a clear Ti Dom function   Jirou on the other hand makes more sense to be an Fi Dom than Ti or Fe combined   Especially with that Stage Singing Episode  Her Fi is so visible during that  She gave up her Music career thing to become a hero because she values that more  That s why she was afraid to tell her Parents  Inf Fe  especially at her age just wouldn t care   Shinso may was afraid to be viewed as a villain for his quirk but he still studies at UA dispite what everyone thought ,istp
Just because she s coolheaded under pressure does not mean she s a Ti dom  She s empathetic not sympathetic  She preferred to go into the shoes of her parents to understand how they felt Fi  rather than emotional persuasion Fe  without understanding their core motives  An Fe user would probably try persuading their parents to think that Hero work is the right occupation  Look at Midoriya for example   The fact she even thought about her parents goes against inf  Fe as a classic hallmark of inf  Fe is the unawareness of the emotions of others  Jirou was aware of how her parents would react and she does do stuff for her classmates    Also Fi users can think about other people  especially if those are a part of their values  In Jirou s case her parents  music and hero work were all something she valued and couldn t really choose between  Midoriya is an Fe user and you can look at how he interacts with his parents compared to Jirou  Jirou was expressing herself and tried to understand the values of her parents Fi  based on her observations Se   Deku was trying to persuade his mom to continue doing hero work  despite all of his injuries  he understood the basics of her mom s values but nothing too much  he was more focused on maintain harmony with her and the collective group Fe  rather individual desires   Where s her Ti lmao  ISTP voters pretty much explained Fe but not Ti  why not vote ENFJ instead  You guys  stop self inserting your useless retarded thinker bias lmao ,istp
I think that scene where she feels bad because she thinks she s letting her parents down with her career choice is a better argument for Fe rather than Fi    Fe is focused on the values of others and maintaining peace  She was reluctant to tell her parents that she wanted to choose to be a hero over pursuing music because it might have caused conflict between them  She even contemplated not doing what she wanted to follow what her family values ,istp
Hmm she doesn t have any te or fi in any of her scenes  You could make the talk with her parents as one but it is really simplistic assuming doing what you want as fi  You could do what you want if it is either logical to you as ti  it is one of your values as fi  if you think it will benefit the collective community as fe and etc  based on her logical and rational approaches to situations  her wanting to hero because she felt that it made sense with her power to help society and her        emotional approach with others especially making sly remarks to Denki and others and her uncomfortableness with her emotions suggests ti Dom,istp
Thinking more about the debates between ISTP   ISFP  it honestly makes more sense for her to be an ISTP  Just because she likes to indulge in music does not mean her F function is stronger than her T function  Though I can completely understand why there would be confusion  She isn t brought upfront for examination in the manga like characters such as Bakugo  Midoriya  and Uraraka  However  you can clearly see her Ti is stronger than her Fi when you see her interact with her classmates  Just because she fits some stereotypes doesn t mean she is an ISFP ,istp
She is an   because  s are very quiet if they are sp  sp makes them introverted  so she is like a tough girl but a quiet tough girl  She is strong because she uses her smartness to be like strong and she wants to be self reliant if you see the whole thing with providing for her brother and stuff ,istp
why so many type   votes ,istp
Why are there so many votes for        because it fits her core fears and desires better  this is why I don t like typing by core fears alone anymore  You all think ISFJ   is ridiculous  Go ask an ISFJ if they d fear being betrayed lmao  Fears and desires aren t the sole decider of your type  you need to at least somewhat fit into the type s trait structure  Although she doesn t fit   trait structures perfectly  they still fit better than     Another prominent argument for   is that she s in a survival game  so of course everyone will care about their safety  and that doesn t make them    I agree with this  but it s the only thing that I see being used to argue AGAINST     s are characterized as people with  over alert hyperintensionality   which isn t just noticeable in the game but even OUTSIDE of it  You can see her cautiousness and mistrust in her interactions with Gi hun when they weren t in the game   for example  her hesitancy to free Gi hun when they got thrown into the streets was due to her tendency to imagine dangers like a   rather than the sadistic nature of an     I saw an argument in favor of sp  specifically that explained how she tends to be more calculating towards risks  This literally contradicts   lol  According to Naranjo   s are the most sensory motor driven type  grounded  to a graspable and concrete here and now   so they prefer acting in the moment without prior planning or calculations    w s aren t the  chill  laid back  type that erupts once you anger them btw   w  isn t even that different from  w   as they re both still  s  The importance of wings is over exaggerated  If she was an    she d be more sadistic  exploitative  and hostile  according to Naranjo  like Deok su  an actual    even if she was an sp  w  because they re still  s  ,istp
I honestly see sp   more than sp   Where s her E  lust  Arrogance  Dominance  Extraversion  Impulsiveness   w  isn t that different from  w   by the way   It doesn t explain her lack of   traits   The sp  is controlled by their physical urges and desires  Sae byeok is quite self controlled and numb to her body  She is grounded  yes  resourceful  yes  but there s just not that E  lust and rage  compulsion to follow their gut  I m not exaggerating  it s a huge part of   that s overlooked and most extreme in sp  s     There is an  internal rape  and  self demanding  nature  when someone gets fixated  within    their desires and sexual urges  possibilities of exploitation and intrusion  power and capacity to do as they please  all of these become  obligations   certain inevitable attitudes without control   ,istp
She is neither curious nor particularly intellectual  RCOEN makes more sense than RCOEI ,istp
Can someone explain the   fix ,istp
I really really can t see her as triple reactive  Compete her to triple reactive characters you ll get what I mean   Also Si base       Delta quadra      She s pretty Gamma ish,istp
 The main ego characteristic of this fixation is Insecurity  The Passion which feeds this ego is Fear  The primary defense mechanism is Projection  Worsening of this fixation can lead to Paranoid Personality Disorder  A secondary defense mechanism is Conversion  Further worsening leads to psychosomatic illness   https   www personalitycafe com threads ichazo on the type            Sae Byeok was never insecure throughout the show  she was always assured and calm of her ability to survive by herself  The only reason she joined Gi hun s group was because she realized she was wrong  that isn t supposed to be a point for her supposed  insecurity  ,istp
With Sae byeok we can see her going against social norms to establish security for her family first and foremost  it was never about the typical Enneagram   lust for power   sensual satisfaction but a need for safety and security for her brother  Yes she often pulled out a knife and displayed hostility but it was solely reactive hostility born of the need to be  fearless  in the face of fear  This is the nature of the countertype Sexual   that attempts to reject a reliance on support outside of the self unlike the other  s and she recklessly puts herself at risk to provide security for her family  She later comes to establish an alliance with Gi Hun to meet these ends of security in the game  This perfectly illustrates the conflicting split nature of the   s SX SP stacking who wants to intimidate and rebel to fend off threats  SX   but also wants to attract safe alliances to provide security  SP    She is not outwardly warm enough and openly alliance seeking to be SP    SX    It is impossible for a SLI who are Se Ignoring to be Enneagram   because all  s are driven by the sin of lust that is ever expansive in the search of intense satisfaction and power  This is not Sae byeok and not SLIs  She seems primarily focused on providing a comfortable material wellbeing for herself and close ones and this fits well with Si ego  I originally considered ESI but she takes considerable time to establish that Gi Hun is a good person and trust him which shows less capable  D Fi  She doesn t seem to focus primarily on the morality of actions and relations like Fi base which makes it hard to envision her as an ESI having worked with Deok su for so long before cutting ties because of this  She is more practical with minor things like sneaking her knife into the games than  D Te and cares little for being embarrassed socially so long as she gets a partner for the marbles game  which suggests very poor unvalued Fe as in the SLI  Not to mention her draw towards Ji yeong and her Ne which would be apparent due to SLIs Ne Suggestive   Don t just vote her an   because she appears hostile and independent  these are not remotely traits exclusive to enneagram    As we established the SX  is very independent because the countertype rejects reliance on outside support systems  Her enneagram sin is so much more evidently fear     than lust     and these  sins  are core components of the enneagram theory that are often outright ignored ,istp
I personally don t think she s a RCOEI   RCOEN in Big    She s not open to new experiences  She s just become cunning and practical because she thinks it s her responsibility as the elder sister to provide something for her brother because of what happened to their parents  She just had to adjust  to be matured   to stay in touch with her surroundings to keep herself and her younger brother alive because no one s going to take care of them anymore  I think another thing that proves she s a RCOEN is how she joined in order for her to have money to get back their parents again and to live a normal life again ,istp
Too cynical and hateful to be SLI ,istp
Can someone please explain the  w   I feel like she s a   personally ,istp
Can somebody explain why she has   in her tritype  Because she decided to save Zuko  Well  that s called love ,istp
I find it hard to find the Se function in her  I can totally see it in Toph    I can see it in Zuko    I can even find it in Uncle Iroh  But with Mai     Can someone explain to me when or where do they notice Se in her functions stack   ,istp
She seems like this double introverted savior  first one is Ti  its crystal clear  But the second one is a bit harder  could be Si or Ni  I don t really know since I hardly see her Ne nor Se ,istp
Whenever I see an ISTP  they really give me the vibe  like Toph  she is the character I can relate to and can clearly both see and sense her being an ISTP  but Mai s type is a bit unclear  she actually fits into ISTJs stereotypes  The quiet  aloof and obedient fighting girl who prefers to lay low and have their peace  but her functions show Ti Se   Si Te   I think that obedient and laying low part of her personality is actually because of her being a    but I m not quite sure  We could see in the show that her   wing helped her being more assertive and expressing ,istp
Enough of stereotyped pictures of ISTP  Quiet girl angry don t cry fight bla bla    It s been a long time since I watched the show If there are mistakes  don t go around  correct them Please I m trying to be peaceful    ISTJs They can be girls who can fight so Let s Begin   introverted senseing  Si    Her mind doesn t lead a rational Function  NOT like Ti   because it is oriented amid the flux of events not by rational judgment but simply by what happens  Whereas the extraverted sensation type is guided by the intensity of objective influences  Like going with Azula and Ty Lee and the reason was Zuko and her love each other   and getting out of her rich  controlling family  Obviously  therefore  no proportional relation exists between object and sensation  but one that is apparently quite unpredictable and arbitrary  What will make an impression and what   I have read arguments about TiSe Really guys  Because she is fighting   It s a cartoon  I can make her character less hostile and her fights are hostile  Cartoon characters are inspired by imagination  Why is anything tangible and realistic  Carl Jung described tangible things   Si  Seen from the outside  it looks as though the effect of the object did not penetrate into the subject at all  This impression is correct inasmuch as a subjective content does  in fact  intervene from the unconscious and intercept the effect of the object  The intervention may be so abrupt that the individual appears to be shielding himself directly from all objective influences  In more serious cases  such a protective defence actually does exist  Even with only a slight increase in the power of the unconscious  the subjective component of sensation becomes so alive that it almost completely obscures the influence of the object  If the object is a person  he feels completely devalued  while the subject has an illusory conception of reality  which in pathological cases goes so far that he is no longer able to distinguish between the real object and the subjective perception  Although so vital a distinction reaches the vanishing point only in near psychotic states  yet long before that the subjective perception can influence thought  feeling  and action to an excessive degree despite the fact that the object is clearly seen in all its reality  When its influence does succeed in penetrating into the subject because of its special intensity or because of its complete analogy with the unconscious image even the normal type will be compelled to act in accordance with the unconscious model  Such action has an illusory character unrelated to objective reality and is extremely disconcerting  It instantly reveals the reality alienating subjectivity of this type  But when the influence of the object does not break through completely  it is met with well intentioned neutrality  disclosing little sympathy yet constantly striving to soothe and adjust  The too low is raised a little  the too high is lowered  enthusiasm is damped down  extravagance restrained  and anything out of the ordinary reduced to the right formula all this in order to keep the influence of the object within the necessary bounds  In this way the type becomes a menace to his environment because his total innocuousness is not altogether above suspicion  In that case he easily becomes a victim of the aggressiveness and domineeringness of others  Such men allow themselves to be abused and then take their revenge on the most unsuitable occasions with redoubled obtuseness and stubbornness   Extraverted Thinking  Te     As an extraverted function  Te is readily identifiable in the presentation and expressions of TJ   Je types  It is characteristically impersonal  focused more on things and systems than people or feelings  TJs readily express their rational judgments  they literally think  i e   make logical judgments  conclusions  and decisions  aloud  Their direct   to the point  style is sometimes perceived by others as harsh  blunt  or tactless  Physicians with poor bedside manner  such as Dr  House of the acclaimed television show  House  are notorious for their Te brusqueness  Te strives to make the external world and its operations more rational  employing precise definitions  policies  plans  and procedures  From the Te perspective  nothing can be optimized unless we work to objectively understand and control it with standard operating procedures  Such standards should always be clearly explicated to minimize ambiguity and the potential for interpretative error  Toward this end  TJ types often end up managing businesses or organizations  ENTJs  in particular  are highly represented among CEOs  with ESTJs and ISTJs gobbling up the middle level management positions  While INTJs may also float to the top of organizations  as Ni dominants  they typically prefer the role of senior advisor to that of manager or decision maker As a character in the shadows   On Carl s description  part    ,istp
She deserves more love  I think it s amazing that in the beach episode Zuko tells her that she doesn t feel anything and that she s afraid to do it    s self indulgence   but when the time comes she goes and saves the idiot who dumped her  she was ready to die and lose  but not without causing harm to those who wanted to hurt the ones she loved  I wonder if her decision to become a florist was influenced by the enneagram  Ty Lee a    became a Kyoshi warrior and part of the royal guard ,istp
I think the Smoke and Shadow comics fleshed out her character more  so I ll be providing what she  most likely  seems to be   SPOILERS  on the comics below    Mai seems to use Ti Fe when initially pretending to like Kei Lo in order to gather information regarding the  New Ozai society s  and her father s involvement    When Tom Tom was kidnapped  Mai noticed her father s reactions seemed relatively calm and unusual for someone who just had a kidnapped family member  which seemed to require Ti Se  Mai presses on with her father in suspicion  In part    Mai explains her logic  via Ti to Zuko on her conclusions regarding her father and what the New Ozai Society is planning    I don t think she uses Ne as Mai doesn t seem to consider multiple possibilities  but she does gather past information to make an insight conclusion  thus using Si  So Does it seem Mai uses Se and Si  Strange  Yet her conclusion in connecting her dad is working with Azula was Ni  thus Se Ni is more plausible   As for inferior Fe  that s been exhibited many times in the series    Thus  I think ISTP is her  most likely  type but I m open to other ideas ,istp

There is no way toph is a FVLE  she literally shows no signs of  V  She is primarily focused on her own goals and is openly dismissive and aggressive to people who disregard her ways to achieve them  her Parents  Katara in s         She seems like a textbook FLVE  https   bestsocionics com psychosophy flve   and she d probably appove with being called  The most dangerous type  but I d honestly say she is a VFLE  https   bestsocionics com psychosophy vfle   bc she seems to have results voilition and she does show signs of  L ,istp

I did the MBTI test for my cat and he got ISTP Damn that is so cool,istp
Why not RCUEI  Cats are commonly known to be curious  there s even a saying about it,istp
Cats first come to my mind when I think of ISTP ,istp
My cat is HEAVY ISTP  He gives everyone the finger and does as he pleases but  he is very physically affectionate to me  Only me  Otherwise  he gets his big Wolverine adjacent rage on ,istp

INFJ   INFJ    Pls say ur kidding  but ISTP voters can you explain why she has inf fe ,istp
I was just wondering   why are the ISTJ votes so low  I m honestly unsure wether she s an ISTP or an ISTJ  I can understand the ENTJ arguments too though   I believe she uses Si over Se  but still think she uses Ti over Te so I m not voting for now  but I m genuinely curious why there are no arguments for ISTJ ,istp
the way she was controlling the others really pissed me off  Like it was so obvious  But then I remembered it s an anime when everyone can be a little bit too much stupid so Moved on     I THINK SHE S AN ENTX,istp
She never really gives me ISTP vibes  Seems more like a XNXJ to me  This is just a vibe not so much me actually typing her  Seems like a   on the enneagram tbh  I don t get                  and   vibes from her  I see more   and    She seems to have developed Fi or Fe from what I see because of the enneagram so It ll seem like she is a feeler like some   or   doms  Just a heads up ,istp
she d have xntj in her bio,istp
      to be honest  I was at a loss for her mbti at first as well  both xstp   ENTJ arguments are good  but lack some details and are mainly focused on simply the dominant function  i m not even going to start on debunking INFJ because that s genuinely absurd and a ton of people have already spoken up about that  rather  I propose to you what I think about her use of cog  functions   now  as I mentioned before  a lot of people here only use her dominant function use as an argument  which  though can be convincing  definitely doesn t cover the whole stack  I believe we should look more into how the inferior function in these types manifests instead   ESTP | ni inferior first off  let me preface this off by saying that it simply is not possible to have a   developed   inferior function  can you work on yourself and this function s zones so it becomes easier to deal with it  yes  but that does not mean you will ever fully grasp it as well as someone with a higher placement on it  moving on  ni is typically attributed traits like having a tunnel vision  the ability to foresee possible consequences of actions and the simple mind game of   connect the dots    what happens when a type  esxp  has it as its  th placement  almost the exact opposite  they struggle with narrowing things down to a single point  a single conclusion  limiting things and drawing a simple answer isn t as easy to them  they focus more on their presence here and now  therefore the inability to create safety nets for the future  if they re lucky with the right decisions  it doesn t matter  but  you will most likely spot a ni inferior person by the way they try to plan organize matters and from their stance about the future  they prefer to work with things hands on rather than abstract connecting in the mind  se dominants see the actual solid thing and not so easily the underlying pattern that ni dominants auxes often notice   this is not celestia in the slightest   she has a clear capability of thinking about the future and the best plan for the situation now according to that vision  she isn t reckless  nor is it hard for her to find the underlying meaning of things  you can easily see these traits showing when she was telling everyone at hope s peak about   the best solution of what to do now     while most others there were panicking their heads off  celestia was able to come up with something that is a great resolution for both the present moment AND the future  something that benefits them and is safe at the same time   ISTP | fe inferior fe inferior is someone who has a hard time understanding the social values and perspectives on others  so they may reject and even dislike anything related to them  it s challenging for them to adjust to something everyone else   a bigger party does  since they re used to only working with their own mind and framework  they re unsure of the right thing to do in a situation involving social problems  so they can hold off of speaking up about it  though  it isn t always as simple as just misunderstanding  ti dominants are easily able to judge others based on what they think is right and how well others are following that  it makes sense to them  so how come all these other people think act differently  it baffles them   celestia doesn t have a hard time understanding others  or at least she doesn t show it often doesn t care about it as much  celestia sees the societal standarts that people have set  along with their mindsets about certain circumstances  and doesn t have much trouble adjusting to them  if her genuinely having fe inferior would be the case  she probably wouldn t even care about co operating with the group and taking charge by setting basic ground rules that are advantageous to everyone  e g    taking the initiative and setting a new rule that prohibits students to roam around during nighttime  ,istp
celestia would ve have been a way better antagonist than byakuya if they only had explored her character more  she deserved better writing,istp
i dont really see her having either auxiliar or inferior fe    maybe terciary ,istp
shes an ENTJ  ive seen people complain about people coming up with deductions like these but ive NEVER seen a good claim that shes ISTP  you just followed eachother like sheep and said ok ,istp
the people who think THIS GIRL is an INFJ are scaring me    genuinely i m not getting the point of view whatsoever ,istp
So based on your typings  there are   ISTPs characters  Levi  Annie and Ymir      which I don t find to be the case  to me  Ymir is INTJ   In my eyes  Mikasa is the ISTP   and I don t think Annie was written to work the same way  Annie seems to be a very deep character with higher Ni and Fe  That Ni gives her willpower and focus and the capacity to ignore Se punishment and gives here a great understanding on how flawed humanity is  including her own people  She knows she is not doing the right thing and she feels like trash herself  Only the love of her father keeps her going and give her purpose  On the other hand  her Fe is so strong that she needs to stay away from people she knows is going to betray  It is too much for her  She feels too much  I think if she was ISTP she could be more detached about the mission  He is a very well trained soldier so I don t think her skills are an argument for Se over Ni  So I think she is INFJ and that is precisely the type for Melancholic phlegmatic  Reiner  ESFJ  and Annie are both strong Fe users  Reiner had to develop a split personality to connect with his friends  and Annie had to detach herserself physically to set her boundaries  Only Berthold  ISFP  that is Fi user was able to be with others while staying emotionally stable ,istp
SLI make sense  Polr Fe we can see on her face    However  valued Fi is also noticeable  Her frequent conversations with Armin about Fi and periodic questions  Do you really see me as a good person    And how Armin catches her with  If you help us   you are a good person  if no   I will consider you as bad  and Annie deliberately went into a trap  although she could have arranged an unexpected surprise for them and quickly dumped  but pulled to the last    quite looks like an Fi activation  Maybe  deep down  Annie hoped that he was telling the truth and really thought of her as good  that he didn t consider her a traitor and a bad person  even if she knew that it s a trap   it was clear that she needed this and even thanked Armin for temporary faith in her good side before her attack  Also  her Se doesn t look too weak  Annie estimates and notices the danger well   She also worked well with Ti  the background function after all  and quickly noticed the details around her  adds them into a logical chain and realized what was happening  when Armin led to the tunnel and Annie asked him quite logical questions based on her analysis of the situation in order to cover their plan   And Delta is suitable too  Annie just did what was needed to survive  there was no idealism in her  She perceived the fanaticism of others as stupidity and spoke directly about it  Eren and Marlowe  well  Reiner too  who was easily brainwashed  while she doesn t see the point in all of this and just goes with the flow  it is clear that the idea of fighting for the people and some idealictic  h t isn t so interesting to her  she just wants a quiet life return home to her father  So LSI isn t suitable   Well  I haven t watched the ova yet  but even by the anime she looks like typical SLI  And  also  I remember how kid Reiner started to cry and Berthold was trying to help him  Annie wasn t even listening  and when Berthold was trying to involve her to this situation  he thought she can help him to cheer up Reiner   she straightly said that she didn t even listen and without any reaction left them   it looks like Fe polr  that isn t able and don t want to influence on others  don t want to be a part of too emotional situation and try to escape it  So  I agree with SLI votes    Wow  badass SLI looks so cool  I wrote this explanation of her type just to say here how I like Annie   ,istp
Creo que ella es otra persona en la temporada    la temporada   es un n cleo   y la temporada     ovas es un n cleo  ,istp
 w    w  will still make sense but she doesn t apparently have any fears of a core    I finished first season only so can t say anything conclusive ,istp
Why RCUEN and not RCOEN  I think she is  Orderly   Especially in the Lost Girls OVA i saw that ,istp
This is a genuine question  why doesn t she have phelgmatic choleric  I only know the basics of temperaments as there aren t that much sources on how they work   I do not get  w   Unless it is  w    s fear of being violated and desire to be self sufficient and I do see that in annie   s in stress do go to   and as  s desire peace of mind  they would likely go to security when in stress and we know in aot that there are losts of stress inducing situations lmao  I would think that  w  would be part of her head triad and that  w  would be in her gut triad but not  w  ,istp
So I wrote a bit about why Annie would be a   rather than a   core in some replies but i ll repost it here and add some stuff       s rely on something outside of themselves for security  Either other people  a system  society  a set of beliefs ect  Annie isn t relying on anything to provide her with security or support  She isn t relying on her relationships with other people  sp    nor is she relying on the social system and authorities  so    She actually doesn t care if her life lacks support  It isn t her main desire  She d rather to just avoid all kind of conflict   disruptive situations and do her own thing  unbothered   Also  none of the   s subtypes fit her   sp     seeks security and support by being friendly and warm and making connections with people they trust   This wouldn t work since she is more of a lone wolf and doesn t mingle much with others  An example of an sp   would be Armin  who sees himself as weak and relies on Eren and Mikasa to protect him   so     seeks security by aligning their beliefs with those of a system  group or community and staying loyal to those beliefs  This wouldn t work either since Annie doesn t care about fitting into society and doesn t rely on a social system or authorities to find security  An example of this would be Floch  who completely devoted himself to the cause of the Yeagerists  which made him feel supported by a group and an ideology   sx     seeks security by acting strong and fearless  by running towards their fears to prove to themselves that they can protect their own selves  This also doesn t work  Annie is too passive and would rather avoid anything that disrupt her peace of mind   self preservation   actually fits her really well    The sp  s just wants to be at peace with themselves  They escape all internal and external conflict by indulging into physical pleasures and comfort  This subtype is the least people oriented of the  s  They seek to be at peace with themselves and their environment  less to keep harmony with other people like the social   or the sexual       I think she fits a lot of the  s stereotypes   very laid back and passive  always has this unbothered attitude  she not completely devoted to anything  she just wants to be left alone with her own peace of mind  she s very unconfrontational  she only fights back when she has no other choices     Annie makes decisions based on what will allow her to get it over with her mission in the least uncomfortable way  She prefers to stay in the background and do her job while attracting the least attention possible  She just wanna return home to see her dad and live peacefully  That s the only reason keeping her going literally ,istp
why    she doesn t even share the fears,istp
Can someone give me a proof of Ni ,istp
I only read the first     pages of THG  Then I decided to look up what Katniss s MBTI was but before looking I tried to type her by myself  In    seconds I came up with ISTP and turns out I was right  I hesitated for a bit between ISTJ and ISTP but she definitely judges internally  Ti instead of Te   Insane how I found her type this quickly with very limited info  just to clarify  I never watched the movie   That s what hours of cognitive functions research does to you lmao  Ironically  I have no idea what MBTI I am  even after  well  those hours of research  Maybe I just need some more time  Well then  let s get back to reading ,istp
Why  w       I don t understand,istp
Ni Dom Hero   Katniss always has a plan for everything  She s driven by willpower and her drive to win is balanced with this and her Te  Coupled with the fact INTJs are triple movement  and I think we can all agree she s definitely a see it through type  Also Ni Child is very spontaneous  and lucky with its own fate  so an ISTP doesn t plan to the point of overthinking at points like Katniss does  they just throw caution to the wind with Se being prioritised more  and somehow survive    Te Parent  Aux    Katniss is highly rational  using strategic methods in order to hunt and survive in the games and her district  and almost every aspect of her life she faces like the games  Also Te is concerned with reputation  and Katniss is very aware of how she will appear to others  if she appears weak on camera from crying or the star crossed lover thing   Responsibly handles brainwashing people into selling the love story of her and Peeta  however   Fi Child  Tert    her strong sense of morals makes her reluctant to do so  and consequently this comes through in her facade  She is strategic but definitely not an ethical person  which you see more of in the books   how much of an INTJ she really is  An example of this would be the bombings of the mountains in District    which she strongly opposes but has no choice in the matter  while everyone else goes along with it  ISTPs with interior Fe would be more likely to go along with it  Unaware of social codes  Fe trickster  this comes out in the way she speaks in interviews and in the Capitol in general  Haymitch telling her she has to get people to like her  as an INTP forced to develop his Fe inferior early  while Katniss is oblivious to how people feel about her  Fe trickster again    Se Inferior ASPIRATIONAL   capitalised because Katniss is extremely aspirational with her inferior function  in that she had to develop it very young to feed her family  children who grow up in third world countries developing cities are more likely to be subconscious focused or have it developed first  as opposed to first world citizens developing their unconscious first  for the arguments saying she wouldn t survive in the hunger games with inferior Se  that is a weak point  because i have seen many examples in my life of people developing their inferior function earlier on and thus can be mistaken for their subconscious  Katniss mistaken for an xSxP   Also  during the interviews and press for the Capitol  as well as propaganda for District    Katniss shows her inferior Se in the way she struggles to put on a performance act for the cameras  much preferring the authenticity  Fi  from her live shots  In the first book before the interview  she says something along the lines of  everyone has something  Glimmer plays off the sexy  glamorous  girly teen  Cato with his brute strength and confidence   etc   She is put into a state of performance anxiety when she can t figure out how to act for the audience  A classic example of ESFP subconscious  which she then has to put effort in to work on after she s won  ENTP unconscious is also shown through her Ne Nemesis  constantly paranoid Peeta will betray her  or any ally to be honest  until he consistently shows his loyalty  Ni doms have this paranoia problem the worst from their Se inferior NEED for die hard loyalty combined with Ne Nemesis worry of others  intentions ,istp
ez E   I recall her speaking  N   She imagines F   she fell in love J   mucho conscientious,istp
I remember the time where I was new to personality types and I was thinking about INTJ as a possibility  I was looking at INTJs to see if I related to them   Somehow many websites type Katniss as an INTJ    And then those that typed her ISTP    I now give you permission to laugh  Her Ti and Se are so clear to me now ,istp
I feel like she s such a difficult character to type  In THG and Catching Fire I lean toward ISTP  but rewatching Mockingjay   and   she really struck me as INTJ    I feel like the setting makes a huge difference  being in the hunger games in THG and CF vs  a war against the government in M     It makes sense why her SE seems more predominant in the first two  and her NI in the second  In a physically demanding game of life or death  you would need to rely more on the present and your senses  whereas war relies more on strategy and intuition    I go back and forth  but I d lean more toward ISTP ,istp
Her being a counterphobic   makes much more sense than an sp    Sx   s commonly mistype as   s  Karnis s is very anti authority  typical for a Sx ,istp
In my opinion  she screams INFJ I don t know how she s a ISTP ,istp
She won the Hunger Games  this fact alone should rule out her being an INTJ  A true INTJ with inferior Se wouldn t last an hour in a  survival of the fittest  reality show  I think she s one of the most striking inferior Fe fictional characters I ve ever read about  She s got a massive amount of Ti   Those   INFP votes tho   ,istp
I perceive much more Si Te in him than Ti Se  but the arguments about his Ti Se make sense as well  On several occasions  he has inadvertently discredited the Ne of his students  such as when he got upset with Million and his friends for dwelling on topics that were not pertinent to the hero class  He is not someone who really gets carried away by abstract ideas and hardly takes the time before taking action  inferior Ne   preferring to get straight to the point in the most practical and concise way possible through the conscientious evaluation of his dominant Si  Also  Si is more present than Se when  for example  he evaluates or he criticizes the actions of others in proportion to what he knows does NOT work because that has been proven before  relating it to past events or situations that support it  watch him scold Midoriya in the first class for his  potentially  dangerous quirk because he relates him to All Might or the many times he took into account the experience of the Villains infiltrating the U A  and that s why he refused to continue classes until he devised ways to continue with these     He is very meticulous  he launches into action after having inspected the details of his surroundings  he is very good at maintaining control and order  he always evaluates the potentials of students  he can get irritated when his students  All Might even  don t follow protocols    Despite his lazy personality  he is a very active person in the intrinsic affairs of U A  High School and he is an important pillar in the way his Te works to deliver accurate  concrete and reliable data to his superiors about some difficult situation and take action  The truth  it s hard for me to see Ti in him  Likewise  he values his rigid and unalterable workspace    We see that his Fi works in a good way by allowing himself to get to know each of his students more deeply and empathize with them and their situation  when he allowed Yaoyorozu to catch him to increase her confidence   His Tertiary Fi isn t the first thing we see  yes  but it s there as we get to know him more throughout the serie  His tertiary Fi is also reminiscent of INTJ s  a function that makes him an emotionally richer person on the inside than his stoic logic allows us to see at first ,istp
I just posted this in a reply down below  but I figured  why not bring it up here too for the sake of discussion    I m not sure I agree with Si base  actually  His Se does seem weirdly decent for ILI  I agree  but he doesn t really seem to be the type that places much value on Si things such as comfort  aesthetic  etc  but more simply because he has to since his quirk drains makes him more tired as a side effect  basically seeing it more as an obstacle to overcome rather than something he genuinely cares about  I d argue Si role is more fitting  To quote Wikisocion for Si role    The individual dislikes it when others emphasize the need for relaxation  enjoyment  and activities that are supposed to bring these about  because what they need internally is just the opposite   a need for action and resolve  Rather than spend their time trying to  listen to what their body is telling them   they need to have clear external demands that are able to overcome their sense of uncertainty and hesitation    Some things to note are that Aizawa tends to get annoyed when his students or other people in general are too quick to relax  He is also someone who often tries many ways of deliberately making his students uncomfortable in order to push them past their limits  whether it be through expelling them  on paper only  so they can experience  death  once  or how he is known to put his students through very rigorous trainings even by MHA lore standards  or how he tries to push a lot of the unpleasant parts of heroism into his teachings as a way to prepare them for the real world   As far as Ni base goes  he does take a very keen interest on how his students can succeed in the future  and how to best prepare them over time  In general he seems to be a very time oriented kind of guy  which is very in line with socionics Ni  which is often referred to as the  time  function  Granted he is a teacher  so of course he is interested in his students  potential  but even outside of that  it s not uncommon for him to be one playing around with abstractions  constantly trying to predict future outcomes as opposed to taking in the moment  so to speak ,istp
Like why is he in anyway egocentric  Everything he does is for his students  He is in my opinion should be accomadating RCUAN ,istp
so many people have voted him INTP  but can u please explain his ne  i really wanna understand why you re voting him as INTP,istp
Why is he a  w  instead of an  w   Does that really explain who he is ,istp
surprised with the amount of INTP votes  where do you guys see Ne  i m fairly new to the show but i ve seen him in enough scenes  and not once did he strike me as an Ne user ,istp
can someone please explain to me how to know that he is an ISTP not an INTP  I have a problem with these two and can t stop mistaking ISTP character for being INTP  I don t know what s the difference between Se   Ne when it comes after Ti ,istp
SLI votes finally caught up  There s no way he s an ILI with  D Se  Aizawa is too quick to react with action for  D Se  the SLI s  D Se makes more sense especially in the way that he deals with Bakugo  For SLI  their Se is in the Id which means that they know how to use it  they just don t value it and only do engage with it when needed  As for Si base  homie literally pulls out a sleeping bag when he doesn t have to do anything lol  He wouldn t have to alter his environment to relax if he was ILI  Si role  ,istp
I have no idea why there are so many INTP votes  He uses his Se aux way too much to be an INTP and I honestly don t see Ti Ne in him  Not to base an entire typing process on my experiences  more like saying it for funsies  but it s quite interesting how every ISTP i ve ever met is the exact copy of him lol,istp
his Ni Se is dead but I think he does have Fi  please don t come at me I m a beginner     ,istp

ENFJ Weaknesses Leap before looking  Passionate and headstrong  ENFJs tend to dive in head first without fully examining or investigating the endeavor in front of them  or fully considering what it will entail  Their Intuitive nature gets the best of them and they are quite sure they have it all figured out  they may not concern themselves with the necessary and important details   Overcommitment  Though they thrive on being a little overwhelmed  ENFJs can easily become over committed because they are genuinely excited about life and all of the opportunities they see before them they want to say  yes  as much as they can and they want to do it all  As a result  they may later have to pull out of commitments they might have examined more carefully before jumping in  and often end up starting and stopping many things without finishing   Struggle to make tough decisions  When making decisions  ENFJs can struggle with information that seems to lack a human element  Hard logic  impersonal reasoning and data based conclusions can be difficult and even undesirable  While ENFJs may be viewed as compassionate  they may also be seen as unfair since they are likely to prioritize the needs of the individual above the whole  and to look more readily to the exceptions than the rules   Too selfless  Because ENFJs prioritize people and the needs of others  they may not be properly in touch with their own needs and can struggle  at times  to express them if they fear that doing so may create conflict or disunity  If they have not developed a strong sense of self they may fail to be authentic in their relationships  As ENFJs already tend toward loneliness  the sense that no one truly knows them can foment the sense of being alone and misunderstood  ,enfj

ESFJ Weaknesses Rigid and judgmental  While they are tolerant in general  ESFJs don t approach the world with a completely open mind  Their value systems are defined by fixed ideas about right and wrong  good and bad  smart and foolish  and they tend to categorize everything they see according to such dualistic concepts   Live and let live  is not a concept that appeals to ESFJs  who are not shy about judging the behavior and character of others based on brief initial impressions   Reluctant to improvise  ESFJs have a lot or respect for rules  laws  regulations and traditional codes of conduct a world without shoulds and shouldn ts and dos and don ts would be unsustainable and chaotic to the traditionalist ESFJ  But in some instances  outside the box thinking may be required  ESFJs can be slow to recognize this reality  making them rigid and unyielding when a bit more openness to change is called for   Neediness  ESFJs have a strong need to be noticed  acknowledged and appreciated  and they want others to see them as helpful  trustworthy and virtuous  This means that their sense of self worth will rise or fall based on the amount of praise or criticism they get from others  ESFJs aren t worried about what other people will think every minute of the day  but they do take rejection very personally and have a hard time getting over any perceived slight   Lack of creative thinking  Too often  ESFJs are so focused on the here and now they miss opportunities for growth and improvement that are staring them right in the face  A long view that embraces creative inspirations  abstract ideas and big picture thinking can allow them to reach new levels of understanding  but taking their intellects in this direction does not come naturally to ESFJs  A failure to respect the benefits of creative power of the imagination can keep ESFJs stuck in patterns of thought and behavior that have long outlived their usefulness ,esfj
ESFJ Growth and Development In order to reach their full potential  ESFJs should  Get some emotional separation  Helping others gives ESFJs enormous satisfaction but  like sponges  they absorb the anxieties of others as if those troubles were their own  Unfortunately  this is emotionally exhausting and can put a huge strain on ESFJs who may become so preoccupied with the suffering and angst of their loved ones that they lose sight of their own personal needs  In the long run  ESFJs would be more effective if they could learn to put some emotional distance between themselves and the people they choose to assist   Practice  letting go   Fish are going to swim  birds are going to fly  and ESFJs are going to make judgments about people and events based on their own exacting standards  But just because they possess this trait doesn t mean they have to indulge it in every single instance  If ESFJs can learn to detach just a bit from their initial impressions  they will have a much easier time altering their judgments as more information comes in  Remember that no one can please all of the people all of the time  ESFJs crave the favorable opinions of others and they always go the extra mile to please  But trying to satisfy everyone in every circumstance is impossible  no matter how friendly or accommodating an ESFJ might be  The sooner they realize this the better off they will be  Like anything else it takes practice to change attitudes  but learning to accept occasional rejection can help ESFJs find greater harmony and peace of mind   Practice solo hobbies  ESFJs can become overly dependent on other people  to the point where they feel ill at ease if there is no one around to talk to  We all need some alone time where we can reflect in peace and silence  Solitary hobbies and activities that require quiet concentration and promote self reliance are highly recommended for ESFJs  who need to get in touch with their feelings and figure out how to get by without constant outside feedback   Learn a little more about how rules  laws  regulations and traditions actually came into being  ESFJs obey the rules and respect traditional ways  But rather than just accepting them without question  ESFJs should consider studying up to understand where they actually came from  Ideas we take for granted now were fresh and innovative at some point in the past  and they often represented a clean break from previous assumptions  Discovering where  self evident truths  and  common sense  really came from can help ESFJs broaden their perspective  And if this makes them a little more open to new ideas in the present  it will be a positive development all the way around    ,esfj

ESTP Strengths Can do attitude  No one will ever call an ESTP lazy or uncertain  and this very self assured  can do approach to life and work is certainly a strength  People of this type spend more time acting than thinking  and while this may seem potentially unwise and hasty  they actually process information very rapidly and have a knack for improvising as they go  This makes them excellent in emergency situations as they think on the fly and respond reflexively   Bold  ESTPs also abound in a mental toughness and sense of competition that make them relentless in pursuing what they are after  They respond well to their physical environment and know how to maneuver their world  They are efficient  clever  bold and driven  And as a result  they often get what they are after and aren t afraid to take a few risks to get there   Personable and sociable  ESTPs are people focused and get along well with just about anyone  They are observant and perceptive  and they read people well  This has the benefit of helping others to feel that they are cared about because the ESTP pays attention and responds appropriately  Though ESTPs may not always pick up on or prioritize emotional cues  they are quick to notice and respond to tangible needs  Direct  ESTPs are efficient  matter of fact  direct and to the point  They don t mince words or want to spend a lot of time hemming and hawing  Many people appreciate their honesty and even their bluntness  you always know where you stand with an ESTP  They aren t afraid to call it like they see it  ,estp
ESTP Weaknesses Judgmental  While ESTPs  powers of perception and observation are often seen as strengths  it may also mean they are quick to prejudge situations and people  and to categorize them based upon initial perceptions  The downfall of this is that they potentially sacrifice many opportunities for profitable or enjoyable relationships or experiences simply on the basis of initial outward appearances   Impatient  Because ESTPs are quick thinkers and doers  they easily become impatient with those who process at a slower pace than they do  who lack their capacity for common sense or street smarts or who tend to be more sensitive or emotional  They feel the emotional concerns of others to be an unnecessary drain on their energy and may resent them  ESTPs will also be reluctant to afford weight to intuition or feelings based arguments  Unstructured  People of this type tend to live in a state of urgency and emergency because they do very little advance planning  Though they may be comfortable with this pattern of living  it breeds chaos for everyone around them and can impede their professional and personal relationships  The crux of the issue is that ESTPs are often unstructured and undisciplined  exercising poor time management skills and taking on far more than they can handle  often because they have a hard time saying no or they refuse to admit they can t fit it all in   Commitment phobic  ESTPs hate to be bored and want life to always be new  stimulating and interesting  The reality  however  is that life is often not interesting or novel and relationships can get a little dull at certain points  They often lack the patience and the drive to stick it out through the low points ,estp
ESTP Growth and Development In order to reach their full potential  ESTPs should  Look inward  ESTPs will benefit from taking time for self reflection and introspection  especially as they age  Throughout their lives they are prone to focus externally  always responding to their environments and the needs of the moment  The constant attention to things outside of themselves can distract them from healthy introspection  causing them to overlook important aspects of their own character and development and leave personal blind spots unaddressed   Consider the consequences  ESTPs are natural risk takers  prone to pursue adventure and risky behaviors  Naturally  this invites the potential for disastrous consequences  Though ESTPs are quite confident in their abilities and usually accurate in these personal assessments  they will benefit from greater time spent considering the potential outcomes of their actions and decisions   Think ahead  ESTPs live life so much in the present that they are often incapable of effectively planning for the future  Though they do enjoy flying by the seat of their pants  ESTPs will find they benefit from composing at least a loose plan or framework  It isn t necessary to follow it exactly  but it can help ensure that they move in the direction of meeting their personal and professional goals  They may benefit from help with long range future planning as well as developing time management skills   Follow through  Constant living and responding in the moment can impede follow through and follow up  People of this type must endeavor to balance the acute with the chronic  the emergency situation or deadline with regular life  ESTPs should try to look at the whole project or problem and its future impact  not just the urgent piece  For the ESTP it is easy  and even comfortable  to jump from urgency to urgency  putting out fires one by one  But jobs need to be finished and wrapped up before hopping to the next task   Check the rulebook  ESTPs naturally follow their own plans  systems and internal codes  This isn t because they are intentionally insubordinate  but because they often don t consider that there may be rules or established protocol that should be considered before plunging ahead  They will avoid unnecessary conflict and tension in the workplace if they can remember to get their plans approved before getting started    ,estp

The INFJ Personality Type INFJs are creative nurturers with a strong sense of personal integrity and a drive to help others realize their potential  Creative and dedicated  they have a talent for helping others with original solutions to their personal challenges  The Counselor has a unique ability to intuit others  emotions and motivations  and will often know how someone else is feeling before that person knows it himself  They trust their insights about others and have strong faith in their ability to read people  Although they are sensitive  they are also reserved  the INFJ is a private sort  and is selective about sharing intimate thoughts and feelings ,infj
What does INFJ stand for  INFJ is one of the sixteen personality types created by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers  creators of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator  MBTI    INFJ stands for Introversion  iNtuition  Feeling  and Judging  which are four core personality traits based on the work of psychologist C G  Jung  Each of the four letters of the INFJ code signifies a key personality trait of this type  INFJs are energized by time alone  Introverted   focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details  iNtuitive   make decisions based on feelings and values  Feeling  and prefer to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible  Judging   The INFJ personality type is also called the  Counselor  because of their tendency to be idealistic  compassionate  and sensitive  Other nicknames for the INFJ include  The Insightful Visionary  MBTI  The Advocate    Personalities ,infj
INFJ Values and Motivations INFJs are guided by a deeply considered set of personal values  They are intensely idealistic  and can clearly imagine a happier and more perfect future  They can become discouraged by the harsh realities of the present  but they are typically motivated and persistent in taking positive action nonetheless  The INFJ feels an intrinsic drive to do what they can to make the world a better place  INFJs want a meaningful life and deep connections with other people  They do not tend to share themselves freely but appreciate emotional intimacy with a select  committed few  Although their rich inner life can sometimes make them seem mysterious or private to others  they profoundly value authentic connections with people they trust ,infj
How Others See the INFJ INFJs often appear quiet  caring and sensitive  and may be found listening attentively to someone else s ideas or concerns  They are highly perceptive about people and want to help others achieve understanding  INFJs are not afraid of complex personal problems  in fact  they are quite complex themselves  and have a rich inner life that few are privy to  They reflect at length on issues of ethics  and feel things deeply  Because Counselors initially appear so gentle and reserved  they may surprise others with their intensity when one of their values is threatened or called into question  Their calm exterior belies the complexity of their inner worlds  Because INFJs are such complex people  they may be reluctant to engage with others who might not understand or appreciate them  and can thus be hard to get to know  Although they want to get along with others and support them in their goals  they are fiercely loyal to their own system of values and will not follow others down a path that does not feel authentic to them  When they sense that their values are not being respected  or when their intuition tells them that someone s intentions are not pure  they are likely to withdraw ,infj

INFJ Strengths Practical insight  Some people are visionaries while others are down to earth problem solvers  but INFJs manage to straddle the line between both identities and they usually succeed masterfully  INFJs are insightful thinkers who see through situations and people effectively and enjoy developing practical strategies for action   Compassion  As a Feeling type  you might expect an INFJ to show compassion but what sets them apart is that their empathy comes with a sharp intuitive edge  They are quick to recognize worry and unhappiness in friends and loved ones  even when outward signs of distress are not visible to others  INFJs are uniquely capable of detecting unspoken and unacknowledged suffering  and are called into action by their instinctive ability to see beneath the surface  Keeping the peace  Mediating disputes is hard work  but INFJs have an astounding ability to help heal the rifts that divide people  They intuitively sense the real suffering that anger can cause if left to fester  and because they are good listeners they are quite effective at helping warring parties find workable solutions that will satisfy the needs of all  And they do it with great energy and determination  Decisiveness  For INFJs  obstacles exist to be overcome and no problem can outmatch the strength and resilience that these types possess deep inside  INFJs follow through on their ideas with conviction  and have the willpower and decisiveness necessary to see projects through to the end  INFJs live for the opportunity to solve problems and bring about positive change in the world ,infj
INFJ Weaknesses Overlooking details  No matter how practically oriented they aspire to be  INFJs have a tendency to get so caught up in theorizing the big picture that they forget to account for some of the precious details that can separate success from failure  Details always matter  and while INFJs may recognize this in principle  in practice they aren t always as diligent about the small stuff as they should be   Intensely private  Despite their loving and sensitive natures  INFJs have a tendency to close themselves off from the world and don t give people the chance to know them or see the wonderful qualities they possess  Even in their relations with family and trusted friends  INFJs can be enigmatic  When they are feeling frustrated or introspective  they may retreat from social contact without so much as a word of explanation  which can throw others for a loop  Conflict averse  INFJs dislike conflict intensely and will usually intervene to stop it  but this is one area where their perspective can get distorted  INFJs often fail to recognize that conflict can actually serve a useful purpose  allowing a good process of give and take to be established and giving all parties the opportunity to resolve their problem forever  INFJs would be wise to acknowledge the value of open and honest dialogue  instead of automatically assuming that all squabbling is harmful  Sensitive  Once an INFJ has made up their mind  they tend to be very confident in their conclusions and may not have much tolerance for those who continue to dissent  When someone challenges their conclusions  they can react very strongly and are especially vulnerable to criticism ,infj
INFJ Growth and Development In order to reach their full potential  INFJs should  Question their intuition  INFJs have outstanding instincts for the most part  but sometimes their intuition betrays them when they are dealing with others  When something is bothering them  INFJs will often withdraw into the safety of their own heads rather than speaking openly about what they are feeling  conversely  they seldom express their feelings of love  affection and appreciation as directly as might be expected given the depth of the emotions they experience  To improve their communication habits  INFJs should go out of their way to share their feelings both good and bad with others regardless of how uncomfortable it makes them feel to do so   Give others the benefit of the doubt  INFJs are insightful  instinctive and persuasive  But despite the enormous effort that INFJs invest in developing and selling their concepts and ideas  sometimes dissidents will remain  INFJs sometimes become disenchanted with those who refuse to accept their conclusions  and they will convince themselves that their opponents have hidden agendas and are acting in bad faith  When situations like this arise  INFJs should try to accept that total consensus is impossible and that some will continue to hold contrary viewpoints  In situations like this  both sides should simply agree to disagree and move on   Let others agree to disagree  too  When tensions are high and arguments are heated  INFJs will do all they can to restore lost cohesion and tranquility  But their love of harmony and aversion to division is so powerful that INFJs refuse to accept that sometimes the best way to end disputes is to bring them out into the open  where bridges of understanding can be built  On balance  INFJs  dislike of conflict is a good thing  But their efforts to play peacemaker might be more successful if they would concentrate on keeping the lines of communication open when disagreements arise instead of always trying to sweep everything under the rug   Make connections with extraverts  Because sharing with anyone outside a small trusted circle goes against their instincts  too often talented INFJs choose to keep their gifts wrapped up and hidden even though they have much to contribute  But INFJs would benefit by cultivating friendly relationships with extraverted people whenever possible  Opposites attract  and there is no doubt that being around more naturally open and communicative people can help bring INFJs out of their shells and out into the world where others can benefit from their intellect  empathy and compassion   Slow down  INFJs are productive and effective when they make a concerted effort to focus on one project at a time  But their fertile imaginations frequently undermine their efforts to stay on the straight and narrow  and they will often start new projects based on fresh inspirations before old ones are finished and  before they know it  they will find themselves buried under an avalanche of work  There is really nothing INFJs can do to moderate the pace of their inspirations  but if they constantly remind themselves to slow down and take things one at a time  they may be able to resist the urge to go off on tangents at least some of the time  ,infj
The INFJ at Work At work  the INFJ is focused on the task of bettering the human condition  INFJs are dedicated  helpful  and principled workers who can be relied on to envision  plan  and carry out complex projects for humanitarian causes  Although they are typically driven by lofty ideals  Counselors gain the most satisfaction from their work when they can turn their ideas into reality  creating constructive change for other people  INFJs are typically organized and prefer work that allows them to complete projects in an orderly manner  They are often independent and tend to prefer a quiet environment that allows them the opportunity to fully develop their own thoughts and ideas  The ideal work environment for an INFJ is harmonious  industrious  and oriented to a humanitarian mission  with co workers who are similarly committed to positive change  The ideal job for a Counselor allows them to use their creativity in an independent  organized environment to develop and implement a vision that is consistent with their personal values ,infj

INFP Weaknesses Sensitivity  Their deep compassion  sensitivity and commitment to originality allows INFPs to interface with their interpersonal landscapes in a constructive manner  but these feelings also leave them vulnerable to disillusionment and powerful existential angst  INFPs who venture enthusiastically out into the world can end up retreating into lethargy and depression when they discover their idealism isn t always shared or respected by others  and their incredible talents can go completely to waste when they become too discouraged to continue  Impracticality  While their insistence on standing up for justice and decency is admirable  the intensity of their feelings can occasionally leave INFPs unwilling to make compromises even when doing so might be necessary to get something accomplished  Sticking to your morals is admirable  but in the real world it may be impossible to accomplish anything unless the INFP can find a way to give and take a little and find practical  if imperfect  solutions to problems   Selflessness  INFPs have a tendency to neglect or suppress their own needs if they believe it is necessary to keep the peace or make others happy  When a person holds his or her insecurities inside for too long  it can eventually cause a blow up or an emotional breakdown  Sensitive INFPs often suffer in silence  and this is a pity because INFPs and their fellow travelers usually have people in their lives who care about them a lot and would be more than happy to help them deal with their heartaches and disappointments   Vulnerability  Compassionate to the core  INFPs lead with their hearts rather than their heads and this can sometimes set them up for trouble  Unfortunately there are users and manipulators out there who are always on the lookout for easy targets  and from the standpoint of these individuals INFPS might as well have flashing neon signs attached to their foreheads that say  exploit me  exploit me   Trust is a wonderful thing  but not when it makes you gullible  ,infp
INFP Growth and Development In order to reach their full potential  INFPs should  Learn to recognize the difference between compromise and concession  People who disagree with INFPs are simply seeing things from a different point of view  but to an INFP  it can feel like they are being backed into a corner  Instead of digging in their heels  INFPs must find a way to detach from the situation so they can comprehend the motivations of their opposition more clearly  If it is only a difference in values and not a lack of them that is responsible for divergent opinions  then INFPs should not expect others to give in to stubbornness any more than they would if the shoe were on the other foot  Make sure dreams and fantasies are used to enhance reality rather than replace it  INFPs who look out at the world with idealistic eyes often see grand vistas of beauty and limitless possibility that others are not capable of perceiving  But INFPs sometimes choose to retreat into these fantasies instead of using them to solve real world problems  Imagination can open the door to better possibilities  and INFPs should never lose sight of its transformative potential   Learn to respect the details  No matter how wonderfully inventive a new idea might be  it won t get anywhere if the logistical details required to put it into practice are ignored or neglected  INFPs may find this aspect of the creative processes a bit boring  but they should challenge themselves to overcome their disinterest and pay attention to all those annoying details anyway   Seek out leadership positions  INFPs have strong egalitarian instincts  are natural conciliators  passionately believe in the utility of cooperation  are excellent listeners  and never fail to pay attention when someone has a new idea to share  These admirable qualities double as superb leadership skills  and no one who possesses them should avoid leadership positions simply because they aren t extraverts  Above all else  leaders must have the respect of those they presume to lead  and INFPs are just as capable of gaining that respect as any other personality type   Accept themselves as they are without apology  Because their standards are so high  INFPs have a hard time forgiving themselves when they fail to meet their own expectations  They may also become indecisive and fall into a perfectionism so extreme that it cuts off their flow of creativity and makes it impossible for them to excel and achieve  This dynamic is unfortunate  especially as INFPs would never think of holding others to such impossible standards  For the sake of their mental health and happiness  INFPs must learn to stop comparing themselves to others and recognize that they should prioritize their own happiness ,infp

INTJ Weaknesses Superiority  The INTJ s prowess in the area of intellect  logic and reason is unarguable and definitely among their chief strengths  as is their confidence in their ideas  However  these strengths can turn into weaknesses when they morph into a superiority complex  Unfortunately  among INTJs  this is not uncommon  They may be arrogant and condescending  as well as impatient with people who don t catch on as quickly as they d like  With those who demonstrate less ability to think logically and rationally  they may be particularly judgmental and intolerant  Emotional Distance  INTJs are also known for their low EQ and unwillingness to engage the emotions their own or others  Preferring to conceptualize the world on a logical  rational basis  they tend to have little patience for emotional concerns  They struggle to pick up on and respond to the emotional cues and needs of others  This can stifle interpersonal relationships  as well as their own growth and development  and may end up keeping others at  at least  arm s distance  Perfectionism  While the meticulousness of the INTJ can be a strength  as in all things  too much of a strength can easily become a weakness  and for the INTJ  this natural fastidiousness quickly becomes perfectionism  and in this they can be quite fierce and painstaking  Their standards in general are exacting and this critique may be directed not only toward themselves  but toward others as well   Imbalance  The INTJ places a high priority on work and will be quite devoted to his or her professional life  But this comes at a price  namely in time that might be spent on family  other relationships and leisure  It is easy for the INTJ to find him or herself with misplaced priorities and  as a result  relational problems  While their drive to succeed professionally can certainly pay off  it can take a toll on the rest of their lives ,intj

INTP Strengths Analytically brilliance  Beneath the quiet surface sits an intellectual prowess which INTPs bring to any environment in which they find themselves  They are fast thinkers and highly logical  Others may not know it since much happens inside the INTP s own own head  yet this type excels in analyzing connections between seemingly random pieces of information and finding flawless explanations to problems that disorient most other personality types  Objective  INTPs are respected for their relentless pursuit of truth  objectivity and understanding  They make this the goal of their lives and channel their energy into rooting out errors and eliminating inconsistencies  They do this not only for their own personal enjoyment but because they see it as their main contribution to the world in whatever field they may find themselves   Imaginative  INTPs think deeply about theory  how to understand and explain difficult concepts  and how systems and products function and might be improved  They naturally see things others don t because they have imaginations that are actively focused and fixated on future potential and possibility   Enthusiastic  To others  the INTP may come across as private and withdrawn but when a topic piques their interest  INTPs can be very enthusiastic  excited even  about discussing it  This excitement makes them fun to be around  In the right company  INTPs are keen to express their imaginative sense of humor  and enjoy being playful with people who they can trust ,intp
INTP Weaknesses Uncertainty  Despite their intellectual prowess  INTPs often live in fear of failure  anxious that they will overlook some critical aspect of their theory  idea or invention  This causes them to be self conscious and to waste time and energy second guessing themselves   Absent mindedness  INTPs aren t labeled  absentminded professors  for no reason  At their worst  they tend to be scattered and disorganized  Intellectual and high minded  they get caught up in their own brains and fail to deal with the low level tedium of the here and now such as bills or deadlines  They may fail to conform to even the basic expectations of daily life in society   Condescension  A significant weakness of the INTP is the tendency to be condescending and critical  either of their opponents or those who simply don t catch on as quickly as they do  Their constant pursuit of truth and objectivity  though admirable  can also provoke brutality and impatience as they drive home their own perspective  This can be especially toxic in relationships in which logic simply does not always reign supreme   Insensitivity  INTPs can get into trouble because of their tendency to prioritize the activity taking place in their minds over the needs of others  They comfortably inhabit the realm of their imaginations and this can bring certain problems  not least that INTPs get so caught up in their own theories and abstractions that they forget any kind of emotional consideration  Their focus on ideas and logic  and neglect of personal considerations  can easily offend ,intp
INTP Growth and Development In order to reach their full potential  INTPs should  Develop emotional intelligence Though INTPs can make very good friends and partners  they are not overly warm or attentive to the feelings and emotional cues of others  While emotional receptiveness and responsiveness will not come naturally to people of this type  focusing on key behaviors that help other people to feel heard and cared for will expand the INTP s ability to relate and connect  Harness the power of relationships  Though they are naturally solitary  INTPs are not at their best when they neglect key relationships  INTPs can easily become isolated  especially if they are working on a difficult problem  While they may be indifferent to how many friends or personal relationships they have  INTPs who can learn to purposely cultivate their social and professional connections will be more successful and happier in the end  Bring others in  INTPs can easily find themselves rutted or caught in their own blind spots and  given the amount of time they spend in solitude  they may not regularly enjoy the input of others that can help to put them back on course  By bringing other people into their inner worlds  INTPs not only serve their relationships  they also get important feedback that can help them to clarify their high level ideas and make them understandable and useful to a wider audience   Think practically  This may be a challenge because INTPs are not characteristically utilitarian or particularly pragmatic  This doesn t mean they don t value efficiency  but that they believe in the value of thinking and experimenting for its own sake  even if there is no practical value or outcome attached to it  While we need people who are committed to taking on dream projects and experiments simply because they re good things to do  employers may be less sympathetic  INTPs should step back and consider their projects from a practical stance  Will this idea actually work  Does it matter  Is this a product people would actually use  Does it have practical value  Become more charitable  INTPs will always be relentless about what is right  true and logical  but can become more charitable with time and effort  This will also involve working to understand and take into account the emotional concerns of others and seeking to develop empathy and compassion  INTPs can start by trying to look at and understand their own emotions ,intp

ISFP Growth and Development In order to reach their full potential  ISFPs should  Choose honesty over harmony  ISFPs do what they can to preserve harmony and promote the peace  But in order to avoid having their needs overlooked  ISFPs need to express themselves openly and honestly  even if what they have to say may be difficult for others to hear  This can cause strife in the short run  but in the long run it will help clear up misunderstandings and erase hurt feelings   Develop a wider concept of what it means to be bold and adventurous  ISFPs tend to underestimate their own skills and intelligence  As a result  they frequently choose not to express themselves or volunteer their services unless they are absolutely certain they will receive a positive reception  But when they surrender to these sorts of insecurities  ISFPs are actually passing up opportunities for adventure  which they normally crave  There s satisfaction to be gained from breaking free of these chains  The results may be unpredictable  but the uncertainty is what provides the challenge   As Michael Jackson used to say  start with the man in the mirror  ISFPs have wonderful personal qualities  Their unselfishness and charitable attitude rank near the top of the list of their most attractive attributes  But ISFPs are so open minded  respectful  considerate and polite that they tend to defer to others in virtually every circumstance  Too often  ISFPs treat others better than they treat themselves  acting as if their needs are somehow trivial or less important  So every now and then  ISFPs should make sure to include their own names on the list of the deserving preferably somewhere near the top  Charity shouldn t end at home  but there is no reason why it can t begin there   Network with dreamers  visionaries and futurists  ISFPs are a bit skeptical of those whose imaginations seem bigger than their accomplishments  In some cases this is justified  but in general ISFPs could benefit by seeking social contact with people who possess the long term vision they sometimes lack  Reading autobiographies or downloading video interviews with such folks will also help ISFPs gain more insight into the thinking patterns and philosophies of successful entrepreneurs and inventors   Actually make some plans for the future  It is possible for ISFPs to look ahead without abandoning their spontaneity and freedom   What would I like to be doing five years from now    What does the phrase  personal growth  mean to me    What would I like my life to look like when I turn      These are the types of general  open ended questions that can help ISFPs focus their creative energies without restricting their ability to make unique  spur of the moment choices  ,isfp
